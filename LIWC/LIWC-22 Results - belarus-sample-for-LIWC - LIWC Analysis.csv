",English,United States,"MOSCOW (AP) — Ukrainian and Western officials are worried that a Russian military buildup near Ukraine could signal plans by Moscow to invade its ex-Soviet neighbor. The Kremlin insists it has no such intention and has accused Ukraine and its Western backers of making the claims to cover up their own allegedly aggressive designs. It’s unclear whether the Russian troop concentration heralds an imminent attack or represents an attempt by Russian President Vladimir Putin to persuade the U.S. and its NATO allies to refrain from sending soldiers and weapons to Ukraine, and drop plans for its eventual integration into NATO. Here is a look at the current tensions: WHAT ARE THE ROOTS OF THE RUSSIA-UKRAINE STANDOFF? Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014 after the country’s Moscow-friendly president was driven from power by mass protests. Weeks later, Russia threw its weight behind a separatist insurgency that broke out in Ukraine’s east. Ukraine and the West accused Russia of sending its troops and weapons to back the rebels. Moscow denied that, charging that Russians who joined the separatists were volunteers. More than 14,000 people have died in the fighting that devastated Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland known as Donbas. A 2015 peace agreement brokered by France and Germany helped end large-scale battles, but efforts to reach a political settlement have failed and sporadic skirmishes have continued along the tense line of contact. Earlier this year, a spike in cease-fire violations in the east and a Russian troop concentration near Ukraine fueled war fears, but tensions abated when Moscow pulled back the bulk of its forces after maneuvers in April. THE LATEST RUSSIAN MILITARY BUILDUP Ukraine complained this month that Moscow has kept about 90,000 troops not far from the two countries’ border following massive war games in western Russia in the fall. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said units of the Russian 41st army have remained near Yelnya, a town about 260 kilometers (160 miles) north of the Ukrainian border. The commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, Lt. Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhny, said Russia also has about 2,100 military personnel in the rebel-controlled east and that Russian officers hold all commanding positions in the separatist forces. Moscow has repeatedly denied the presence of its troops in eastern Ukraine. Kyrylo Budanov, head of Ukraine’s military intelligence, claimed in a weekend interview with the Military Times that Moscow was preparing an attack from several directions, including from Russia’s ally Belarus, in late January or early February. Russia hasn’t provided any details about its troops numbers and locations, saying that their deployment on its own territory shouldn’t concern anyone. WHAT DOES MOSCOW WANT? The Kremlin has accused Ukraine of failing to honor the 2015 peace deal and criticized the West for failing to encourage Ukrainian compliance. The agreement was a diplomatic coup for Moscow, requiring Ukraine to grant broad autonomy to the rebel regions and offer a sweeping amnesty to the rebels. Ukraine, in turn, has pointed to cease-fire violations by Russia-backed separatists and the continuing Russian troops presence in the rebel east — accusations the Kremlin has denied. Amid the recriminations, Russia has rejected a four-way meeting with Ukraine, France and Germany, saying it’s useless in view of Ukraine’s refusal to abide by the 2015 agreement. Moscow has strongly criticized the U.S. and its NATO allies for providing Ukraine with weapons and holding joint drills, saying that encourages Ukrainian hawks to try and regain the rebel-held areas by force. Earlier this year, Putin ominously said a military attempt by Ukraine to reclaim the rebel east would have “grave consequences for the Ukrainian statehood.” The Russian leader has repeatedly asserted that Russians and Ukrainians are “one people,” and charged that large chunks of Ukrainian territory are historic parts of Russia — arbitrarily granted to Ukraine by Communist leaders under the Soviet Union. Putin has strongly emphasized that Ukraine’s aspirations to join NATO represent a red line for Moscow, and also expressed concern about plans by some NATO members to set up military training centers in Ukraine. He said that would give them a military foothold there even without Ukraine joining NATO. “They may put anything there under the guise of training centers,” Putin said last month. “Formal membership in NATO may never come, but the military development of the territory is already under way.” IS THE THREAT OF A RUSSIAN INVASION REAL? Russia rejected talk of an invasion plot as a Western smear campaign and charged the claims could conceal a Ukrainian intention for an attack in the east. Ukraine denies such plans. U.S. officials conceded that Moscow’s intentions are unclear, but pointed to Russia’s past behavior as a cause for concern. Speaking to Ukraine’s foreign minister this month, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Putin’s “playbook” was to build up forces near the border and then invade, “claiming falsely that (Russia) was provoked.” Some observers interpret the troop buildup as a demonstration by Putin that Russia is prepared to raise the stakes to convince NATO to respect Moscow’s red lines and stop sending troops and weapons to Ukraine. Last week, Putin noted with satisfaction that Moscow’s warnings finally have got some traction and caused a “certain stress” in the West. He added: “It’s necessary to keep them in that condition for as long as possible so that it doesn’t occur to them to stage some conflict on our western borders that we don’t need.” He urged Russian diplomats to push for “serious long-term guarantees ensuring our security in this area because Russia can’t keep on going like that, constantly thinking about what could happen there tomorrow.”",western,1,928,93.31,50.98,42.13,7.58,23.2,32.65,80.93,54.42,42.03,6.57,1.4,0,0.32,0,0.32,0.65,5.17,14.66,8.62,1.4,14.87,5.28,2.16,5.39,0.86,10.88,5.82,2.8,11.1,2.69,1.29,7.11,8.19,0.32,7.76,1.19,1.72,1.19,1.19,0.22,1.94,0,5.28,1.94,3.34,0.75,0.11,0.65,0.43,0.11,0,0,10.88,6.9,0.86,0.11,2.26,0.65,2.16,4.31,0,0.11,0,0.32,6.9,4.42,2.48,0,2.16,0.22,0.22,1.62,0.11,0.11,0.32,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.22,0.32,0.22,0.32,0,0.11,0,0,0.43,0,3.13,12.07,0.54,1.29,9.81,0.54,0,0.32,4.31,3.56,3.66,1.4,0,0,0,0,0,15.52,4.85,3.66,0.32,0,2.48,4.2

Cyber fuzzy rules of engagement,English,United States,"BOSTON (AP) — President Joe Biden couldn’t have been more blunt about the risks of cyberattacks spinning out of control. “If we end up in a war, a real shooting war with a major power,  it’s going to be as a consequence of a cyber breach of great consequence,”  he told his intelligence brain trust in July. Now tensions are soaring over Ukraine with Western officials warning about the danger of Russia launching damaging cyberattacks against Ukraine’s NATO allies. While no one is suggesting that could lead to a full-blown war between nuclear-armed rivals, the risk of escalation is serious. The danger is in the uncertainty about what crosses a digital red line. Cyberattacks, including those that cripple critical infrastructure with ransomware, have been on the rise for years and often go unpunished. It’s unclear how grave a malicious cyber operation by a state actor would have to be to cross the threshold to an act of war. “The rules are fuzzy,” said Max Smeets, director of the European Cyber Conflict Research Initiative. “It’s not clear what is allowed, what isn’t allowed.” The United States and other NATO members have threatened crippling sanctions against Russia if it sends troops into Ukraine. Less clear is whether such sanctions, whose secondary effects could also hurt Europe, would be imposed if Russia were to seriously damage Ukrainian critical infrastructure — power, telecommunications, finance, railways — with cyberattacks in lieu of invading. And if the West were to respond harshly to Russian aggression, Moscow could retaliate against NATO nations in cyberspace with an intensity and on a scale previously unseen. A major cyberattack on U.S. targets would almost certainly unleash a muscular response. But what of lesser cyberattacks? Or if Russian President Vladimir Putin restricted them to a NATO member in Europe? Under Article 5 of the organization’s treaty, an attack on any of its 30 members is considered an attack on all. But unclear is what it would take to unleash full-scale cyber retaliation. Or how bad an attack would have to be to trigger retaliation from NATO’s most potent cyber military forces, led by the U.S. and Britain. Cyberspace is exceptionally unruly. No arms control treaties exist to put guard rails on state-backed hacking, which is often shielded by plausible deniability as it’s often difficult to quickly attribute cyberattacks and intelligence-gathering intrusions. The technology is cheap and criminals can act as proxies, further muddying attribution. Freelancers and hacktivists compound the problem. In 2015, the major powers and others agreed on a set of 11 voluntary norms of international cyber behavior at the United Nations. But they are routinely ignored. Russia helped craft them only to knock Ukraine’s power grid offline that winter and set in motion its hack-and-leak operation to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Hacking is now a core component of great power conflict. In 2016, NATO formally designated cyberspace a “domain” of conflict, alongside land, sea and air. Nowhere has the militarization of cyberspace been more clear than in Putin’s bid to return Ukraine to Moscow’s orbit. To Serhii Demediuk, the No. 2 official on Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, a noisy cyberattack last month was “part of a full-scale Russian operation directed at destabilizing the situation in Ukraine, aimed at exploding our Euro-Atlantic integration and seizing power.” The attack damaged servers at the State Emergency Service and at the Motor Transport Insurance Bureau with a malicious “wiper” cloaked as ransomware. The damage proved minimal, but a message posted simultaneously on dozens of defaced government websites said: “Be afraid and expect the worst.” Such attacks are apt to continue as Putin tries to “degrade” and “delegitimize” trust in Ukrainian institutions, the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike  said in a blog  on Russian military cyber wreckage in the former Soviet republic: Winter attacks on the power grid in 2015 and 2016 were followed by NotPetya, which exacted more than $10 billion in damage globally. Michele Markoff, the U.S. State Department’s deputy coordinator for cyber issues, thinks “muscular diplomacy” is the only way  to end such “immoral, unethical and destabilizing behavior.” But how? Unlike nuclear arms, cyberweapons can’t easily be quantified, verified and limited in treaties. Nor are violators apt to be held accountable in the United Nations, not with Russia and China wielding veto power on its Security Council. “We’ve wallowed kind of in a quagmire for years now on making transgressors accountable,” said Duncan Hollis, a Temple Law professor and former State Department legal adviser. Members endorsed in May an update to the 2015 U.N. norm s that further delineates  what should be out of bounds: including hospitals, energy, water and sanitation, education and financial services. That has hardly deterred Russian-speaking ransomware crooks,  who are at the very least tolerated by the Kremlin. Nor have U.S. indictments of Russian and Chinese state hackers and the blacklisting of tech companies accused of aiding them  helped much. Under a new policy NATO adopted last year after U.S lobbying, an accumulation of lower-level cyberattacks — far below, say, blacking out the U.S. East Coast — could be enough to trigger Article 5. But NATO is vague on what a tipping point might be. NATO’s doctrinal shift followed a pair of seismic cyberespionage shocks — the highly targeted 2020 SolarWinds supply chain hack by Russia that badly rattled Washington and the reckless March 2021 Microsoft Exchange hack attributed to Chinese state security that set off a criminal hacking free-for-all. A cluster of wholesale data pilfering in the mid-2010s attributed to China — from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, United Airlines, Marriott hotels and the health insurer Anthem — inflicted a deep national security wound. And U.S. officials have worried for more than a decade about rivals — Russia especially — quietly “pre-positioning” enough malware  in U.S. critical infrastructure including the energy sector  to cause considerable chaos in an armed conflict. In response, U.S. Cyber Command  developed a strategy in 2018 it calls “persistent engagement”  to counter rivals who “operate continuously below the threshold of armed conflict to weaken institutions and gain strategic advantages.” The aim: deny foes the chance to breach U.S. systems by operating “across the interconnected battlespace, globally, as close as possible to adversaries,” Cybercom commander Gen. Paul Nakasone wrote. That has sometimes meant penetrating not just adversaries’ networks but also those of allies — without asking permission, said Smeets, the European cyber conflict analyst. Disinformation campaigns have also muddied the definition of a “cyber threat.” No longer do they merely encompass malware like NotPetya or the the Stuxnet virus that wrecked Iranian nuclear centrifuges, an operation widely attributed to the U.S. and Israel and discovered in 2010. During the 2018 U.S. midterm elections, Cybercom temporarily knocked offline a key Russian disinformation mill. Most major powers have the equivalent of a U.S. Cyber Command for both offense and defense. Also active are terrorists, criminals working as state proxies, begrudged freelancers and hacktivists like the Cyber Partisans of Belarus. Hollis compares the current messy cyber moment to the early 19th century when U.S. and European navies were so small they often relied on privateers — we know them now as pirates— for high-seas dirty work. The U.S. and other NATO partners are, meantime, helping Ukraine stand up a separate cyber military unit, said Demediuk, the Ukrainian security official. Since Russia seized Crimea in 2014, NATO has closely and systematically coordinating cyber actions with Ukraine, including joint missions, he said. In November, Ukraine exposed an eight-year espionage operation by agents of Russia’s FSB in Crimea involving more than 5,000 attempted hacks. The main goal: to gain control over critical infrastructure, including power plants, heating and water supply systems,  Ukraine’s state news agency said. This month, Microsoft said the operation, dubbed Armageddon, persists with attempts to penetrate Ukraine’s military, judiciary and law enforcement. Microsoft detected no damage, but that doesn’t mean Russian cyber operators haven’t gained undetected footholds. That’s where hackers hide until they are ready to pounce. ___ Associated Press writer Yuras Karmanau in Kyiv, Ukraine, contributed to this report.",western,1,1327,92.47,33.65,17.81,1.61,20.42,32.71,78.67,52,41.9,4.3,1.51,0,0.3,0.15,0.23,0.6,2.79,11.68,7.99,1.81,14.85,5.88,3.01,6.03,1.21,9.65,6.63,2.56,8.36,1.36,1.28,5.88,10.63,0.75,9.65,1.06,2.19,0.98,1.96,0.38,3.54,0,5.05,0.98,4.07,0.68,0,0.68,0.15,0.23,0,0,9.04,5.88,0.68,0,2.11,0.6,1.51,3.17,0,0,0,0.23,8.89,4.3,1.36,3.24,3.32,0.08,0,2.86,0.3,0.08,0.9,0.38,0.23,0,0,0,0,0,0.08,0.68,0,0.38,0,0.15,0,0.45,1.28,0.15,2.26,7.16,0.23,0.98,5.43,0.23,0.23,0.23,3.24,2.94,3.24,0.83,0.15,0.15,0,0,0,19.59,7.23,5.65,0.23,0,1.81,4.67

",English,United States,"A serviceman of the Ukrainian Armed Forces takes part in military drills at a training ground near the border with Russian-annexed Crimea in Kherson region, Ukraine, in this handout picture released by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine press service November 17, 2021. Press Service of General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine/Handout via REUTERS Nov 23 (Reuters) - Russian troop movements near Ukraine have drawn concern from Kyiv and the United States that it might be considering attacking its neighbour. Here is a look at some of the questions that raises. Russia denies threatening anyone and says it can deploy its troops on its own territory as it pleases. It has accused Ukraine and NATO of whipping up tensions and suggested Kyiv might be preparing to try to seize back two eastern regions controlled by pro-Russian separatists since 2014. Russia's foreign spy agency this week compared the situation with the build-up to a 2008 war in which Russia's forces crushed those of neighbouring Georgia.  read more Ukraine denies planning any such offensive and says Russia has more than 92,000 troops massed near its borders for a possible attack.  read more Reuters spoke to more than a dozen sources, including Western intelligence officials and Russians familiar with Kremlin thinking, and nearly all agreed that an invasion is unlikely to be imminent. A more plausible scenario, they said, was that President Vladimir Putin is using the credible threat of military force to signal that Russia is serious about defending its ""red lines"" on Ukraine. It has stated numerous times in recent weeks that it is not prepared to accept the supply of NATO weapons to Ukraine or any NATO military presence there, let alone the prospect of eventual Ukrainian membership of the alliance. Putin, these sources added, is adept at escalating and de-escalating crises - as he did in the spring, when more than 100,000 Russian troops gathered near Ukraine's border and subsequently pulled back. In this way, he is keeping Russia's opponents guessing about his intentions and reminding the West that Russia is a force to be reckoned with. Russia's armed forces have 900,000 active personnel compared with 209,000 for Ukraine, an advantage of more than four to one, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). But Samir Puri, senior fellow in hybrid warfare at the IISS, said the real advantage for Russia was that it already has proxies fighting in the separatist war in eastern Ukraine, giving it the option to link up with them and extend the area already under their control. Were it to go for a broader invasion, he said, it could contemplate attacking from the north (from Russia and its ally Belarus), from the east or from the south (via Crimea, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014), with a naval assault on the cities of Odessa and Mariupol. Ukraine is significantly stronger militarily than in 2014, when it lost Crimea to Russia without a real fight. It has advanced anti-tank missiles supplied by Washington, and could draw on U.S. intelligence support. But it would still face an overwhelming adversary - the Russian advantage in battle tanks, for example, is more than three to one. ""For Ukraine, the issue would be ... to resist as much as they can, pray for assistance from the West, and ultimately fight back,"" said Mathieu Boulegue, a research fellow at London's Chatham House think-tank. ""If Russia invades in full, the question for Kyiv will be to mount counter-insurrection-style warfare to make the cost of invasion tremendous for Russia."" WHAT ELSE MIGHT DETER MOSCOW? The West imposed sanctions on Russia after the seizure of Crimea and could add painful new measures, such as preventing it from pumping Russian gas through the newly built Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany. Putin would risk a complete rupture of relations with the West if he invaded. It is unclear how far NATO might come to the defence of Ukraine, something that would be fraught with risk for all sides. Ukraine is not a member of NATO, but doing nothing would leave the alliance looking irrelevant. ""This is the brinkmanship game that is playing out. Both in NATO in Brussels and in Moscow there will be calculations  around where the escalatory steps could lead. If NATO was to deploy to fight ... the Russians would see this as an unbelievable escalation,"" said Puri. ""Whether (Ukraine) ends up as a battleground I think is unlikely - but really that's the issue that Russia and NATO are fencing around at the moment in Ukraine.""

The decision on sanctions was made by the government and submitted to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's security and defence council. If the council approves, it will be enacted by presidential decree. Ukraine froze contact with neighbouring Belarus last year and joined with the European Union in condemning the elections as not free or fair. Lukashenko denies electoral fraud.

U.S. President Joe Biden warned there is still a “very high” risk of a Russian invasion within “several days.” And, in what the United States described as an unprovoked move, Russia expelled a senior U.S. diplomat in Moscow. A day after Moscow said it was returning troops to bases, the NATO allies said Russia is actually building up forces near Ukraine. At the same time, Ukraine and the Russia-backed rebels in its east accused each other Thursday of intensive shelling along the line of contact in Donetsk and Luhansk. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, on his way to an annual security conference in Germany, was rerouted to the United Nations to promote a diplomatic solution. Here’s a look at what is happening where and why: WHAT WE DO AND DON’T KNOW ON THE GROUND Russia says it moved its troops away from the conflict zone. But NATO allies say constant movements mask their true intentions. NATO allies accuse Russia of misleading the world by saying some 7,000 troops were being returned to bases, but instead moving in thousands of new ones. Maxar Technologies, a commercial satellite imagery company that has been monitoring the Russian buildup, reported continued heightened military activity near Ukraine, including a new pontoon bridge and a new field hospital in Belarus. Russia has massed an estimated 150,000-plus troops on three sides of Ukraine in recent weeks, but denies it is plotting an invasion. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Russia has “enough troops, enough capabilities, to launch a full-fledged invasion of Ukraine with very little or no warning time, and that is what makes the situation so dangerous.” “The fact that you’re putting a battle tank on a train and moving it in some direction doesn’t prove a withdrawal of troops,” he said. “It has to be a meaningful withdrawal, a meaningful de-escalation.” Shelling along the border in Ukraine’s separatist-controlled east also has fueled speculation that Russia might be creating a pretext to invade Ukraine. A sharp increase in skirmishes in recent days raised that specter. In the latest incident, separatist authorities in the Luhansk region reported an increase in Ukrainian shelling. The Ukraine military said it had not fired back after its forces were shelled. They said the shells also hit a kindergarten, wounding two civilians. WHAT DO SATELLITES SHOW? Widely available commercial satellite imagery of Russian troop positions bracketing Ukraine provides a bird’s-eye view of an international crisis as it unfolds. But the pictures, while dramatic, have limitations. High-resolution photos from commercial satellite companies in recent days confirmed that Russian forces are arrayed within striking distances of Ukraine. But they could not provide conclusive information about net additions or subtractions of Russian forces or reveal when or whether an invasion of Ukraine would happen. In such a fluid crisis, even day-old satellite photos might miss significant changes on the ground. The U.S. military and intelligence agencies can piece together a better picture of what’s happening by combining satellite imagery with real-time video as well as electronic information scooped up by aircraft such as the Air Force’s RC-135 Rivet Joint, not to mention information gathered from human sources. THE DIPLOMATIC FRONT As EU and NATO officials sent out assurances that there’s still room for diplomacy, Russia expelled the second-highest U.S. diplomat in Moscow. Washington said the expulsion of U.S. deputy chief of mission Bart Gorman was an unprovoked escalation in tensions. “We are considering our response,” the State Department said. HOW DOES THE UNITED STATES SEE A RUSSIAN INVASION UNFOLDING? Blinken went before the U.N. Security Council on Thursday to sketch out how Washington contends a Russian attack would unfold, revealing conclusions of U.S. intelligence in a strategy the United States and Britain have hoped will pre-empt any Russian invasion planning. The United States has declined to reveal most of the evidence underlying its claims on Russia’s planning. A sudden, seemingly violent event staged by Russia to justify invasion would kick it off, Blinken told U.N. diplomats. “We don’t know exactly” the pretext, he said — a “so-called terrorist bombing” inside Russia, a staged drone strike, “a fake, even a real attack … using chemical weapons.” The military attack itself would open with cyber attacks and missiles and bombs dropping across Ukraine, America’s top diplomat said. Painting the U.S. picture further, Blinken described the entry of Russian troops, advancing on Kyiv, a city of nearly 3 million people, and other “key targets that have already been identified and mapped out.” U.S. intelligence indicated Russia would target “specific groups” of Ukrainians, Blinken told the U.N., again without giving details. In an implicit nod to Secretary of State Colin Powell’s appearance before the Security Council in 2003, when Powell cited false U.S. intelligence to justify the U.S. invasion of Iraq, Blinken added, “Let me be clear. I am here today not to start a war, but to prevent one.” The State Department said late Thursday that Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov had agreed to meet in Europe next week, “provided there is no further Russian invasion of Ukraine.” WHAT IS MOSCOW SAYING? Russia on Thursday reaffirmed its demand for the U.S. and its allies to keep Ukraine out of NATO but held the door open for talks on a range of security issues. The Russian Foreign Ministry handed over its formal reply to the U.S. and NATO security proposals and later published it on its website. The document again denies Western claims that Russia has an intention to invade Ukraine, but repeats that NATO’s expansion to Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations would be a “red line” for Russia. It says Moscow will continue pressing its demands for no further NATO expansion and for the alliance to roll back its forces from Eastern Europe, and could take unspecified “military-technical measures” if the West continues to ignore them. At the same time, it says Russia is ready to discuss measures to enhance security in Europe by negotiating limits on missile deployments, restrictions on patrol flights by strategic bombers and other confidence-building steps provided they are discussed in conjunction with Moscow’s main proposals. HOW ARE UKRAINIANS REACTING? Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested that NATO membership is a distant dream for his country, blaming both opposition from Russia and from some unidentified NATO members. “It is not the Ukrainian people who choose when we will be (in NATO), because it depends not only on us: 30 countries must unanimously agree on this decision,” Zelenskyy said. WHAT IS NATO DOING? Stoltenberg, in opening a meeting of the alliance’s defense ministers in Brussels, said Russia has “yet again demonstrated its disregard for the principles underpinning European security, and its ability and willingness to threaten the use of force in pursuit of its objectives.” U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters in Brussels that Russia is moving troops close to the border, flying in more combat and support aircraft. “We see them sharpen their readiness in the Black Sea. We even see them stocking up their blood supplies,″ he said. “You don’t do these sort of things for no reason, and you certainly don’t do them if you’re getting ready to pack up and go home.″ Meanwhile, the alliance is bolstering its eastern regions. The U.S. has started to deploy 5,000 troops to Poland and Romania. Britain is sending hundreds of soldiers to Poland and offering more warships and planes. It also is doubling the number of personnel in Estonia and sending tanks and armored fighting vehicles. Germany, the Netherlands and Norway are sending additional troops to Lithuania. The White House said Biden would discuss the matter with trans-Atlantic leaders in a phone call Friday afternoon. The Canadian prime minister’s office said the call would include the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania, the United Kingdom, the European Union and NATO. The U.S. Senate voted overwhelmingly Thursday night to show unwavering support for an independent Ukraine and “condemn” Russian military aggression toward its neighbor. ___ Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow; Yuras Karmanau in Kyiv, Ukraine; Matt Lee in Munich, Germany; Darlene Superville and Robert Burns in Washington; Lorne Cooke in Brussels; Jill Lawless in London; Frances D’Emilio in Rome and Edith Lederer at the United Nations contributed.",western,1,1405,90.1,53.66,46.08,6.63,21.29,30.75,79.79,54.66,42.99,6.26,2.35,0.14,0.57,0.5,0.36,0.71,3.91,12.6,7.97,1.07,13.95,5.98,2.85,5.34,1.07,11.89,5.27,2.56,7.62,2.28,0.78,4.63,8.83,0.28,8.54,2.14,1.85,1,1.21,0.64,2.42,0,3.84,1.14,2.7,0.36,0.07,0.28,0.07,0.21,0,0,11.32,6.48,0.71,0.14,1.14,0.36,2.99,4.84,0,0,0,0.43,6.69,5.12,1.28,0.28,3.13,0,0.28,2.56,0.21,0.07,0.5,0.28,0.14,0,0,0,0,0.07,0,0.21,0.07,0.21,0,0.14,0,0,1.07,0.07,3.27,12.31,0.43,1.42,9.18,1.42,0,0.14,3.63,3.2,3.77,1.21,0.28,0.21,0.07,0,0,19.07,6.98,5.05,0.36,0,1.57,5.12

A pair of human chains grasped a blue and yellow banner along the edge of a stadium field in Kyiv, one on either side. Others clutched tiny flags individually on Wednesday, which Ukraine’s president declared a day of national unity. One made it onto an Olympic podium in China. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for displays of Ukrainian unity on a day that British and American intelligence officials had predicted might bring a Russian invasion as more than 130,000 Russian troops were massed on Ukraine’s borders. Russia has denied any plans to attack Ukraine. Zelenskyy himself tempered his call for unity with skepticism that Feb. 16 marked anything other than yet another day Ukraine faced threats from its aggressive neighbor. “Last night, I and many people were waiting for the war, but the war didn’t start, said Mikhail Risenberg, a student who took part in the ceremony in the eastern city of Kharkiv to show his readiness to resist possible Russian attack. In Kharkiv, a city located 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the Russian border, people dressed in traditional folk costumes and sang the national anthem during a solemn flag-raising ceremony. In the city of Sievierodonetsk, which was seized by pro-Russian separatists in 2014 and taken back by the Ukrainian military two months later, hundreds wore blue and yellow ribbons. The city is now a provincial center of the Luhansk region, a hub for international organizations that monitor the volatile front lines with the separatists. Few Ukrainians held any illusions that the threat was gone. “Russia will not leave us in peace, that’s why we have to be always ready for it,” Yuri Maistrenko, a scientist in Kyiv, said. “It did not start today, but it could tomorrow or after a month.” And so Ukrainian officials kept on preparing for a potential attack. In Kyiv, city authorities gave a tour of an underground shelter beneath the main train station with a capacity for 2,000 civilians short-term and a fortified Soviet-era section for workers to keep the transit system operating during a crisis. Most of the capital’s 5,000 bomb shelters have other uses, including serving as subterranean parking garages, bars, and even a strip club. Zelenskyy helicoptered in to observe military drills near the border with Belarus and to thank the participating soldiers. He said they gave confidence for “both today and tomorrow.” Across the border, Russia and Belarus were holding their own joint military drills. “We are not afraid of any people, any enemy. We are not afraid of any dates because we will defend ourselves both on 16 February and on 17 and in March, in April and in September and in December and no matter what day and month,” the Ukrainian leader said. At the Winter Olympics in Beijing, there was unexpected unity — and one main difference — between Ukraine’s Oleksandr Abramenko who won the silver medal in men’s freestyle skiing and Russian competitor Ilia Burov won bronze. China placed first. Burov and Abramenko embraced at the award ceremony, but only Abramenko held his country’s flag wide.

REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko KYIV, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Ukraine and the United State will start joint military exercises in western Ukraine next week, the Ukrainian General Staff said on Thursday, days after Belarus and Russian staged large-scale drills that have concerned neighbouring countries. The ""Zapad-2021"" war games ran on Russia and Belarus' western flanks, including sites close to the European Union's borders, and alarmed Ukraine and some NATO countries.  read more Ukraine said the ""RAPID TRIDENT – 2021"" exercises would involve 6,000 troops from 15 countries - Ukraine, the United States and other NATO members – and would last till Oct. 1. ""The main goal is to prepare for joint actions as part of a multinational force during coalition operations,"" it said in a statement. Ukraine views the military exercises with Western partners as an important step on the path to NATO, believing that membership in the alliance would strengthen the country's resistance to Russian aggression. Kyiv's relations with Moscow deteriorated in 2014 after Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine and backed pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine’s Donbass region. The seven-year war with separatists killed more than 13,000 people. Ukraine's relations with Belarus also have worsened since Kyiv called the 2020 presidential election in Belarus neither free nor fair and condemned violence against protesters.

In a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg as the annual Munich Security Conference got underway, Harris thanked the alliance for “all that you have done” throughout the crisis. “We remain, of course, open to and desirous of diplomacy, as it relates to the dialogue and the discussions we have had with Russia, but we are also committed, if Russia takes aggressive action, to ensure there will be severe consequence in terms of the sanctions we have discussed,” Harris told Stoltenberg. “And we know the alliance is strong in that regard.” Harris and her top national security aides huddled with Stoltenberg after President Joe Biden on Thursday in Washington warned that “every indication” suggests Russia is “prepared to go into Ukraine, attack Ukraine.” Russia probably has massed between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and near Ukraine, said Michael Carpenter, the permanent U.S. representative to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The 190,000 estimate announced Friday includes not only military troops along the border and in Belarus but also forces that were not included in the previous U.S. estimate of 150,000. It adds troops in Crimea, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014; Russian National Guard and other internal security units; and Russian-led forces in eastern Ukraine. Harris said it was “intentional” that she was holding her first meeting at the annual security conference with NATO’s secretary general. The administration is trying to drive the message to Putin that the crisis has only bolstered the 30-country military alliance’s resolve to push back against Moscow’s aggression. Stoltenberg echoed Harris’ sentiment of growing NATO unity during the crisis. “I also welcome the fact that European allies are stepping up, also increasing their presence in the eastern border of the alliance and also investing more in defense,” Stoltenberg said. “So the reality is that North America and Europe are doing more together now that we’ve done for many years.” U.S. and European officials are on high alert for any Russian attempts to create a pretext for invasion. Officials are concerned that increased shelling in the Donbas region, the slice of land where Russian-backed separatists have battled for years against the Ukrainian government, could be used by the Kremlin as a pretext to launch an invasion of Ukraine. Harris met with Latvian President Egils Levits, Lithuania President Gitanas Nauseda, and Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas to discuss the latest developments related to Russia’s buildup on Ukraine’s border and U.S. readiness to further reinforce NATO allies on the eastern flank of the alliance. Harris underscored to the Baltic leaders, who are watching the situation on the Ukraine-Russian border warily, that the Biden administration is committed to a central tenet of the NATO alliance: the principle of mutual defense. “Our position has always been and will continue to be that Article 5 is ironclad and the spirit behind it — an attack on one is an attack on all — remains our perspective,” said Harris, referring to the charter that spells out the mutual defense provision. “I do believe our greatest strength is our unity.” Nauseda urged the U.S., which has bolstered its troops presence in the Baltics in recent weeks, to do even more and create a “permanent presence” in Lithuania. Currently, the U.S. deploys a small contingent of troops to the country on a rotational basis. “I would say it is critically important for the security of our region to see more presence of United States troops,” Nauseda said. Kallas echoed the call for a greater U.S. presence in the Baltic countries. “We have lost our independence to Russia once, and we don’t want it to happen again,” she said. Harris is set to deliver a major address at the conference on Saturday that will focus on the Ukraine crisis. Preparations for the address were fluid, but Harris in part is expected to spotlight the unity of NATO and Western allies in the face of the Ukraine crisis, the administration official said. Meanwhile, Biden planned to speak by phone Friday with trans-Atlantic leaders about the Russian military buildup and continued efforts at deterrence and diplomacy. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was also in Munich on Friday where he was met with his counterparts from Britain, France and Germany.

216,reuters.com,2021-11-12 08:00:00,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-russia-usa-idUSKBN2HX15A,"Russia is not a threat , says Kremlin after media report about possible Ukraine attack",English,United States,"MOSCOW/PARIS, Nov 12 (Reuters) - France on Friday warned Russia against harming Ukraine's territorial integrity, after the United States shared with European allies its fears over Russian troop movements on the Ukrainian border and over a potential attack. Four European diplomats told Reuters that U.S. officials had raised their concerns about an attack on Ukraine with their European Union allies at a briefing in Brussels. Two said the meeting was held on Wednesday with 30 ambassadors at the level of the NATO transatlantic alliance. France's foreign and defence ministers, Jean-Yves Le Drian and Florence Parly, issued an unusually blunt statement after meeting their Russian counterparts in Paris. ""The two ministers expressed their concerns about the deteriorating security situation in Ukraine and clearly warned of the serious consequences of any further possible damage to the territorial integrity of Ukraine,"" the statement said. Earlier in the day, Russia had dismissed as inflammatory suggestions Moscow might be weighing an attack and accused the United States of aggressive moves in the Black Sea. The European diplomats declined to give further details on U.S. reasons or evidence for fearing an attack. In addition, one diplomatic source said that last week at a North Atlantic Council meeting - the principal political decision-making body within NATO - Karen Donfried, Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, briefed in more detail on her recent trip to Moscow and shared her concern about the troop build-up. ""The patterns of Russian behaviour are different from what we have seen before,"" a NATO source said without elaborating. ""So far, it is unclear if this military build-up is intended to lead to an incursion into Ukraine or if it is just another exercise."" Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and says the waters around it belong to Moscow now despite most countries continuing to recognise the peninsula as Ukrainian. Russian-backed separatists took control of Ukraine's eastern Donbass region that same year and soldiers on both sides continue to be regularly killed in the conflict there. The Kremlin said it was up to Moscow where it deployed within its borders. ""Such headlines do nothing more than pointlessly and groundlessly fuel tensions. Russia does not pose a threat to anyone,"" said spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, in Paris for the talks with Parly and Le Drian, was quoted by TASS as saying it was important to work with France to de-escalate the Ukrainian situation. In another rare rebuke of Moscow, Paris earlier this week accused it of blocking efforts to put together a ministerial meeting between France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine that aims to push peace accords agreed in 2014. France and Germany accused Russia of imposing unrealistic conditions, something Moscow denies. The European Union this week accused close Russian ally Belarus of encouraging thousands fleeing war-torn parts of the world to try to cross its borders. Brussels is expected to impose new sanctions next week, diplomats have said. There is no suggestion at this stage that Russia is supporting Belarus operationally, although it has publicly chided the EU. Russia's ministry of defence said it detected six flights by NATO spy planes in airspace over the Black Sea, part of what it described as intensifying reconnaissance by the Western military. The Russian military also said it was tracking U.S. naval ships in the Black Sea and accused Washington of studying the region as a potential theatre of war. After returning from Washington, Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Kyiv and its Western allies had stepped up diplomatic efforts to warn Russia against launching a new military attack on Ukraine. [USN:ID:L1N2S30RJ] A spokeswoman at Germany's foreign office said ministers from France, Germany and Ukraine would discuss the crisis on Monday in Brussels.

Russia, a veto-wielding member of the Security Council, dismissed the meeting as a “PR stunt.” The diplomatic push at the U.N. comes with 100,000 Russian troops massed near Ukraine’s border and the Biden administration worrying that Russian President Vladimir Putin will mount some sort of invasion within weeks. Here are things to know Monday about the international tensions surrounding Ukraine. WHAT’S THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL DOING? Russia accused the West of “whipping up tensions” over Ukraine and said the U.S. had brought “pure Nazis” to power in Kyiv as the U.N. Security Council held a stormy and bellicose debate on Moscow’s troop buildup near its southern neighbor. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield shot back that Russia’s growing military force of more than 100,000 troops along Ukraine’s borders was “the largest mobilization” in Europe in decades, adding that there has been a spike in cyberattacks and Russian disinformation. “And they are attempting, without any factual basis, to paint Ukraine and Western countries as the aggressors to fabricate a pretext for attack,” she said. The harsh exchanges in the Security Council came as Moscow lost an attempt to block the meeting and reflected the gulf between the two nuclear powers. It was the first open session where all protagonists in the Ukraine crisis spoke publicly, even though the U.N.’s most powerful body took no action. More high-level diplomacy is expected this week. U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement that the meeting was “a critical step in rallying the world to speak out in one voice” to reject the use of force, seek military de-escalation, support diplomacy and demand accountability from every member “to refrain from military aggression against its neighbors.” RUSSIA SENDS COUNTERPROPOSAL TO U.S. The Russian government has sent a written response to a U.S. proposal aimed at deescalating the Ukraine crisis, according to three Biden administration officials. The officials all spoke on the condition of anonymity. The Russian response comes as the Biden administration continues to press the Kremlin to deescalate the growing crisis on the Ukraine border, where some 100,000 Russian troops have massed. A State Department official declined to offer details of the response, saying it “would be unproductive to negotiate in public” and they would leave it up to Russia to discuss their counterproposal. The Russian response comes less than a week after U.S. and NATO officials sent in writing proposals addressing grievances the Kremlin said must be addressed by the West. The U.S. and NATO, however, held firm to the alliance’s open-door policy for membership, rejected a demand to permanently ban Ukraine from joining, and said allied deployments of troops and military equipment in Eastern Europe are nonnegotiable. President Biden on Monday said the U.S. continues “to engage in nonstop diplomacy” to deescalate the situation. “We continue to urge diplomacy as the best way forward, but with Russia continuing its buildup of forces around Ukraine, we are ready no matter what happens,” Biden said. The U.S. on Monday ordered the departure of families of American diplomats in neighboring Belarus, after already drawing down the American presence around its embassy in Ukraine. Russia has sent troops, tanks and other materiel to Belarus for what it says are military exercises. The deployment raised fears Belarus could be a northern front in any Russian military move into Ukraine. — Aamer Madhani and Matthew Lee in Washington BIDEN MEETS QATAR RULER TO DISCUSS GAS President Biden met with the ruling emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, at the White House to discuss issues including global energy supplies as the U.S. and Europe scramble to put in place backup plans to get gas to Europe if supplies are hit by a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russia supplies about 40% of the natural gas used in Europe. Natural gas future prices surged last week amid growing market fears that a potential conflict could disrupt Russian exports transiting through Ukraine to the continent. Qatar is one of the world’s larger suppliers of liquefied natural gas and is among countries that the U.S. is hoping could aid Europe should a Russian invasion of Ukraine lead to Moscow shutting off the flow of gas piped to Europe. Any Russian invasion into Ukraine would almost surely trigger harsh economic sanctions from the U.S. and its European allies. That could lead to oil and gas shortages around the world and, most likely, higher energy prices that could send tremors through the global economy. UKRAINIAN WOMEN TAKE UP ARMS Some women in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv have vowed to take up arms to defend their nation if there is a Russian invasion and are already training in the use of military weapons. Svetlana Putilina, the head of an organization for Muslim women in Kharkiv, spends her weekends training with other women how to aim, load and fire automatic rifles and other weapons. Kharkiv, just 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the border with Russia, is Ukraine’s second-most populous city and some fear it could be one of the first targets in a cross-border attack. “This city has to be protected. (Russia) has a big appetite and they are taking piece by piece. This should not happen,” said 55-year-old Viktoria Balesina. Women who have already finished their military-style training aren’t resting. They’ve joined forces to make camouflage netting that can be sent to the front line. POLAND OFFERS ‘DEFENSIVE’ AMMUNITION TO UKRAINE A top security official said Monday that Poland has offered to send “defensive” ammunition to neighboring Ukraine. The head of Poland’s National Security Bureau, Pawel Soloch, said that the decision to offer the military support was taken following top-level talks with Ukraine, the United Stats and NATO allies. Polish President Andrzej Duda recently met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and held talks with President Joe Biden and with NATO leaders. He later discussed the situation regarding the Russia-Ukraine tension with Poland’s political and security leaders. “We are talking about political backing, but also about material support in the humanitarian but also in the military dimension,” Soloch said. The dozens of thousands of rounds of ammunition on offer are for “defense” purposes, Soloch said. Poland is awaiting Ukraine’s response to the offer. ___ Follow all AP stories on Russia and Ukraine tensions at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",western,1,1073,97.06,61.65,17.42,6.02,22.35,29.64,79.59,54.8,42.4,4.29,1.68,0,0.28,0.37,0.28,0.65,2.61,13.98,9.04,1.49,16.31,5.22,2.42,4.66,0.37,12.58,5.22,3.54,8.76,2.05,0.75,6.15,7.36,0.56,6.71,0.47,1.77,1.4,1.12,0.56,1.49,0,3.73,1.03,2.7,0.84,0.09,0.75,0.37,0.28,0,0,12.49,7.08,1.12,0.19,0.93,0.19,3.54,4.85,0.09,0,0.65,0.09,6.62,4.47,1.86,0.28,4.01,0.19,0.47,2.7,0.56,0.09,0.56,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.09,0,0.37,0.09,0.56,0,0,0,0,1.21,0,1.96,10.62,0.09,1.49,8.76,0.19,0,0.37,2.42,4.19,3.54,1.03,0.47,0.47,0,0,0,17.52,7.08,3.82,0.09,0,1.4,5.13

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko threatened on Thursday to retaliate against any new European Union sanctions against Minsk over a migrant standoff on the Belarus-EU border, suggesting he could halt the transit of gas and other goods via Belarus.  read more His warning briefly lifted spot gas prices  in Europe, which gets about a third of its supplies of the fuel from Russia, including via the Yamal-Europe pipeline that runs through Belarus to Poland and Germany.  read more The Belarusian section of the Yamal-Europe pipeline is owned by Russia's state gas monopoly, Gazprom (GAZP.MM). ""I've recently spoken to (Lukashenko) twice and he didn't mention this to me once, he didn't even hint,"" Putin said in a state television interview, making his first public comments about the Belarusian threat. ""Of course, in theory, Lukashenko as president of a transit country could order our (gas) supplies to be cut to Europe. But this would mean a breach of our gas transit contract and I hope this will not happen,"" Putin added. Russia has been Belarus's closest ally for years, helping with everything from cash to cheap energy supplies and military assistance, but Lukashenko's comments come at a sensitive time for Russia's energy exports to Europe. Analysts say Lukashenko's gas comments have likely tested Putin's patience with Russian gas supplies already at the centre of heated debate in Europe.  read more European gas prices - and therefore, energy bills - are on the rise this year as the recovery from the pandemic has triggered a spike in demand, forcing customers from Europe to Asia to fight for supplies. Some European politicians have accused Moscow of failing to do more than just send contractual gas volumes, in order to calm down prices. The European Commission said on Friday that if Lukashenko made good on his threats, it would further harm gas suppliers. During Saturday's interview, Putin said that if Belarus did cut off supplies, it would ""cause great damage"" to the European energy sector ""and would not help in developing our relations with Belarus as a transit country"". ""I will raise this with him (Lukashenko) in case this wasn't something (he) said in the heat of the moment,"" Putin said. Russia, which this week started to increase supplies to refill its European storage ahead of the winter heating season, has said more could come once its newly built Nord Stream 2 pipeline gets a green light from Germany. Nord Stream 2 is another Russian pipeline designed to bypass transit countries, particularly Ukraine, which has a history of gas pricing standoffs with Moscow. The Kremlin calls the pipeline a ""purely commercial project"" and denies that politics are behind it in any way. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

198,bbc.co.uk,2022-02-11 08:00:00,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60341966,"Ukraine tensions : Can diplomacy prevent war ? ",English,United Kingdom,"The prospect of a wider war in Ukraine is dreadful to contemplate. If Russia were to invade, thousands could die. Many more might flee. The economic cost would be severe, the humanitarian cost devastating. Yet Russia continues to build up its forces around Ukraine, and the West continues to threaten dire consequences if they were to step one foot over the border. So is there a diplomatic way out, an exit from this confrontation that is peaceful and durable? Diplomats talk of an ""off ramp"", a way that all sides can get off the road to war. But finding such a path is not easy. Any compromise would come at a price. Here, though, are some potential routes that do not involve a military and thus bloody outcome. Under this scenario, Western powers would effectively deter any invasion by convincing Russian President Vladimir Putin the costs would outweigh the benefits. He would be persuaded that the human casualties, the economic sanctions and the diplomatic blowback would be so great that he would come off worst even if he made military gains on the battlefield. He would have to fear the West might support a military insurgency in Ukraine, thus bogging him down in a costly war for years. Mr Putin would have to believe these costs would reduce his domestic support and thus threaten his leadership. Under this narrative, the West would also have to allow Mr Putin to claim a diplomatic victory, portraying himself as a peaceful protagonist who had been unwilling to respond militarily to Nato provocations. Mr Putin could claim he had finally got the West's attention and its leaders were addressing what they called his ""legitimate security concerns"". Russia would have reminded the world it was a great power and deepened its presence in Belarus. The difficulty with this narrative is that it would be just as easy to argue Mr Putin had failed. His actions would have united the West; led Nato to move forces closer to Russia's borders; and encouraged Sweden and Finland to consider joining Nato. The problem is that if Mr Putin wishes to control Ukraine and undermine Nato, there are few reasons why he might back down now. Western powers have made clear they will not compromise on core principles, such as the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine; its right to seek membership of Nato; which must have an ""open door"" to any country that wishes to join. But the US and Nato have, nonetheless, accepted that common ground could be found on wider European security issues. This could include a revival of lapsed arms control agreements to reduce the numbers of missiles on both sides; the beefing up of confidence building measures between Russian and Nato forces; greater transparency over military exercises and the location of missiles; and co-operation on anti-satellite weapon testing. Russia has already made clear these issues would not be enough to satisfy its core concern that allowing Ukraine to join Nato would come at a cost to Russian security. But if, say, Nato missile deployments were significantly reduced, that could address at least some Russian concerns. In some ways, Putin has already made gains here: Europe is newly engaged in a security dialogue on Russia's terms. This was a package of deals negotiated in 2014 and 2015 in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, that was designed to end the war between government forces and Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine. It obviously failed - the fighting continues. But it at least set out a path towards a ceasefire and a political settlement based on a more federal constitution. Western politicians have suggested reviving the Minsk accords could now be a solution to this crisis. French President Emmanuel Macron said Minsk was ""the only path allowing us to build peace"". Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told the BBC Today Programme that restoring Minsk would be ""a strong way forward to de-escalate"". The problem is that the provisions of the agreement are convoluted and disputed. The Kremlin demands that Ukraine must hold local elections to empower pro-Russian politicians. Kyiv wants Moscow first to disarm and remove Russian fighters. The biggest dispute is over how much autonomy Minsk would give to breakaway enclaves in the Donbas. Kyiv says modest self-government. Moscow disagrees and says Donetsk and Luhansk should have a say over Ukraine's foreign policy and thus a veto over Nato membership. And that is the big fear in Kyiv: that reviving Minsk is shorthand for ruling out Ukraine ever joining Nato without Nato members explicitly having to say so. Thus agreement and popular support in Ukraine is unlikely. Could Ukraine be persuaded to adopt some kind of neutrality? There have been reports - subsequently denied - that French officials suggested Ukraine could take Finland as a model. Finland adopted formal neutrality during the Cold War. It was an independent, sovereign and democratic state. It remained - and remains - outside Nato. Could this be attractive to Kyiv? It would avoid a military outcome. It might, in theory, satisfy Mr Putin's desire for Ukraine never to join Nato. And the alliance would not have to compromise on its ""open door"" policy: Ukraine would have made its sovereign choice not to join. But would Ukraine support this? Probably not because neutrality would effectively leave Ukraine open to Russian influence. It can be hard to enforce neutrality, and would Russia abide by its terms? Neutrality would be a major concession by Kyiv which would have to abandon its Euro-Atlantic aspirations. Neutrality might also make membership of the European Union even more distant. Might it be possible for the current confrontation just to linger on - but diminish in intensity over time? Russia could slowly pull its troops back to barracks, declaring their exercises over. But at the same time a lot of military equipment could be left behind, just in case. Moscow could continue supporting rebel forces in the Donbas. And all the while, Ukraine's politics and economy would continue to be destabilised by the constant threat from Russia. In turn, the West would maintain a strengthened Nato presence in Eastern Europe. Its politicians and diplomats would continue to engage sporadically with Russian counterparts, where talks continued - but little substantive progress was made. Ukraine would struggle on. But at least there would be no full-scale war. And slowly the confrontation would fade from the headlines and re-join the long list of frozen conflicts that disappear from public attention. None of these options is easy or likely. They all involve compromise. The fear in Kyiv is that Ukraine might be the country that has to compromise the most. The calculation, though, is whether the threat of devastating conflict is real and if so, what could be done to avoid it. The one vestige of hope right now is that all sides still seem willing to talk, however fruitlessly. And the longer people keep talking, the longer the diplomatic door to a solution remains open, even if it be just ajar.

Gas prices rose this week after Germany's energy regulator suspended the approval process for Nord Stream 2, a major new pipeline built to bring Russian gas into Europe.  read more Flows via the Yamal-Europe pipeline into Germany at the Mallnow metering point on the Polish border were at an hourly volume of just below 11,800,000 kilowatt hours (kWh) by 1000 GMT on Thursday morning, down from around 12,300,000 kilowatt hours seen on Wednesday, the data showed. The pipeline is one of the major routes for Russian gas exports to Europe. Nominations for Thursday's volumes at the Velke Kapusany metering point on the Slovak-Ukraine border, another major route to Europe, were for 1.0 million megawatt hours or 94.4 million cubic metres, similar to previous days. Germany's decision to suspend certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline could delay its commissioning until March next year, sources told Reuters this week. The Kremlin declined to comment on the specific timing on Thursday. [nL1N2S80Y6] ""No one can or should interrupt the (German) regulator's work. The company (the Nord Stream 2) is fulfilling all bureaucratic formalities to get this certification process done,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Establishing a limited liability company in Germany as is now required can take several weeks or longer, if, for example, documents or evidence have to be obtained in the formats prescribed by German corporate registration law, lawyers say.  read more Nonetheless, European gas prices eased on Thursday morning in a highly volatile market, driven by a milder weather outlook in December and as other energy commodities also eased. The European benchmark TTF front-month contract  was down 3.70 euros at 91.80 euros per megawatt hour by 1020 GMT. Oil prices slid to six-week lows on Thursday as China said it was moving to release strategic reserves.  read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

It is the latest claim about Russia's alleged plans to be publicised by Western powers. The Kremlin has denied the existence of any ""kill list"". And some Western officials acknowledge the alleged plans are speculative, and may not be put into action. But Russia's FSB Security Service is believed to be involved in preparing the political ground for any occupation if orders are given. The little-known Fifth Service of the FSB is likely to play a key role in the event of a significant escalation in Ukraine. The Fifth Service and its Department of Operational Information runs covert operations in many states neighbouring Russia and has taken the lead in Ukraine. It has established networks of agents within Ukraine and has been preparing to activate them in the event of conflict, Western intelligence sources say. The aim will be to limit resistance and ensure control. If there is an attempt to remove the government in Kyiv, that could involve senior figures working in key institutions and industries being approached and instructed to work with Russia - or else face the consequences, it is claimed. Russia has denied plans to invade, and some Western analysts remain sceptical that Russia has the forces or the intent to mount a full-scale occupation with all the risks that this would entail. The claim about a list of targets to be arrested or even killed came in a letter from the US Ambassador to UN organisations in Geneva, to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. The US said ""likely"" targets are those who oppose Russian actions, including Russian and Belarusian dissidents in exile in Ukraine, journalists and anti-corruption activists, as well as religious and ethnic minorities and LGBTQ+ persons.  The letter says the US also has information that Russia plans to use lethal measures to disperse protests if there is an occupation. The letter is the latest salvo in Washington's attempts to expose what it says are Moscow's plans for Ukraine. The US has not presented further details or cited the source of its information. And it is not clear how far any such plans might have progressed, or what scenarios would lead to them being put into action. The purpose of exposing such information is partly to act as a deterrent to Russian behaviour - and some officials acknowledge that they cannot be totally confident what will unfold. The Kremlin responded by saying talk of a ""kill list"" was ""absolute fiction"". ""There is no such list. It's a fake,"" spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. The US letter does not specify which part of the Russian intelligence or military services would be involved in such activity, and the FSB's Fifth Service is likely to be preparing political plans for any attempted take-over rather than directly enforcing control through arrests. ""The Fifth Service is the FSB department that would be tasked to provide plans and scenarios for Ukraine's post regime change political future,"" explains Andrei Soldatov, an expert on the Russian intelligence services. Even though it is primarily a domestic service, the FSB has the lead role amongst Moscow's intelligence agencies in Ukraine. Back in 1992 Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, the SVR, signed a deal with Ukraine and neighbouring states not to spy on them. That left the way open for the FSB which grew in power, particularly after its head in the late 1990s, Vladimir Putin, became Russia's leader. The SVR and military intelligence, the GRU, both still operate in Ukraine but the FSB leads on intelligence and influence operations. The current head of Service Five, Sergei Beseda, personally travelled to Ukraine in 2014 during the events surrounding the Maidan uprising that led to the removal of a pro-Russian government. Watch: Amid fears of a Russian invasion, families in Ukraine are worried they will have to flee for a second time Since 2014, a low-level war has been going on between Ukraine and Russian spy services. The Ukrainian Security Service has accused the FSB of carrying out sabotage and assassinations. In 2017, a senior Ukrainian intelligence official was killed in a car bomb. The FSB were also accused of running a high-level mole within the Ukrainian security services who was also allegedly involved a plan for an assassination. A recent report for the RUSI think-tank by Jack Watling and Neil Reynolds said that in July 2021 the Ukraine team of the Fifth Service was expanded to form the Ninth Directorate comprising around 200 officers. The FSB's current network could include further agents within the Ukrainian security and defence establishment ready to switch sides in the event of the crisis escalating whilst other agents could take control of institutions in local districts around the country. But how far such plans for political change and even arrests are put into action will depend on final decisions on the overall strategy from Russia's leaders.",western,1,832,93.21,33.91,37.37,11.63,23.77,28,81.97,58.05,48.8,4.21,0.84,0,0,0,0,0.6,3.37,15.14,10.46,1.68,14.78,8.29,2.88,5.89,0.84,12.86,5.29,2.04,7.93,0.48,2.52,5.53,12.5,0.24,12.26,3,3,0.96,2.88,0.12,3.13,0,3.49,1.32,2.16,0.36,0.12,0.24,0.24,0,0,0,7.21,4.45,0.12,0,1.56,0.6,1.56,2.88,0.12,0,0,0,4.81,3,1.68,0.12,5.29,0.12,0.24,4.81,0,0.12,1.44,0,0,0,0,0,0.12,0,0.96,0.36,0,0.24,0,0,0,0,0.96,0.12,1.8,9.62,0.24,1.68,7.57,0.24,0,0,1.92,3.37,5.05,3,0,0,0,0,0,12.02,4.21,3.25,0,0,1.44,3.13

Moscow said it was a ""destructive"" step which heightened tension and reduced the scope for a political solution. The Pentagon said 2,000 US troops would be sent from North Carolina to Poland and Germany, and a further 1,000 already in Germany would go to Romania. Russia has some 100,000 troops near Ukraine. It denies planning to invade. The tensions come eight years after Russia annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula and backed a bloody rebellion in the eastern Donbas region. Moscow accuses the Ukrainian government of failing to implement the Minsk agreement - an international deal to restore peace to the east, where Russian-backed rebels control swathes of territory and at least 14,000 people have been killed since 2014. The US and the Western military alliance Nato question the continued build up of Russian forces near Ukraine. On Thursday Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance had seen a ""significant movement"" of roughly 30,000 Russian troops to Belarus in the last few days - the biggest deployment to the country since the end of the Cold War. Russia says the troops are there for joint military drills. Ukraine, meanwhile, has sought to dampen talks of conflict. Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said on Thursday the number of ceasefire violations in eastern Ukraine had dropped, and that there have been no combat losses for three weeks. In a separate development, Russia announced that it was closing the Moscow bureau of German broadcaster Deutsche Welle and revoking accreditations for its staff. This comes a day after Germany banned Russian state TV network RT on the grounds that it did not have a legitimate broadcasting permit. Responding to US President Joe Biden's decision to deploy extra troops to Europe this week, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko said it was a ""destructive"" and an ""unjustified"" step. Speaking on Wednesday, Mr Grushko added that it would ""delight"" the Ukrainian authorities, who would continue sabotaging the Minsk agreement ""with impunity"". On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov urged the US to ""stop escalating tensions"" in Europe, saying the new troop deployment worsened the situation and adding that Russian concerns about Nato's eastward expansion are ""absolutely justified"". The Pentagon has said the US troops being deployed would not fight in Ukraine - but would ensure the defence of Washington's allies. Their deployment is in addition to the 8,500 troops the Pentagon put on alert last month to be ready to deploy to Europe if needed. ""It's important that we send a strong signal to Mr Putin and, frankly, to the world that Nato matters to the United States and it matters to our allies,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Wednesday. But on the question of alleged invasion plans by Mr Putin, he said: ""We still don't believe he's made a decision to further invade Ukraine."" He also said a US proposal ""leaked to a European news outlet"" was genuine. He appeared to be referring to a story in Spain's El País newspaper about a US offer of talks with Russia in exchange for reducing tensions over Ukraine. The US proposals reportedly include: The documents said the US would discuss all issues that affect European security with its allies. These are combat-ready troops but they are not expected to be fighting Russian soldiers - if they were the deployment would be much bigger. After all Moscow is not seen to be directly threatening Poland and Romania. Joe Biden is trying to show this resolve without undermining chances of a diplomatic solution. He is not sending a lot of troops, and notably, none to the Baltic states right on Russia's doorstep. But these deployments are the most concrete sign that the current crisis is broader than Ukraine, that it's over the post-Cold War security infrastructure in Europe. Rivalry between Russia and the US, which still possess the world's biggest nuclear arsenals, dates back to the Cold War (1947-89). Ukraine was then a crucial part of the communist Soviet Union, second only to Russia. Mr Putin said the US had ignored Moscow's concerns in its response to Russian demands for legally binding security guarantees, including a block on the Nato alliance's further expansion to the east. Romania, which is hosting some of the newly deployed US troops, is home to a US-built Aegis land-based missile defence station, which Russia has described as a security threat since it opened in 2016.",western,1,767,93.59,61.74,28.52,3.31,23.24,29.6,80.44,57.89,45.37,6.78,2.35,0,1.17,0,0.65,0.39,4.43,14.6,9.78,1.69,14.47,6.65,2.09,4.17,1.04,12.78,5.74,4.56,9,3.78,0.78,4.43,9.39,0.52,8.6,1.83,1.56,1.3,1.04,0.39,2.61,0,4.17,0.91,3.26,0.26,0.13,0.13,0.13,0,0,0.13,12.65,7.95,1.04,0.65,1.43,0.26,3.65,6.26,0,0,0,1.43,6.52,4.17,2.09,0.26,0.91,0.13,0.13,0.65,0,0,0.26,0.13,0,0.13,0,0,0,0,0.13,0.52,0,0,0.39,0.26,0,0,1.17,0,1.69,9.91,0.65,1.17,7.17,0.65,0,0.78,4.17,5.22,3.52,0.91,0.26,0.13,0.13,0,0,15.12,4.3,4.04,0,0,1.83,4.95

Poland confirmed that the large migrant camp on Belarus's side of the border was emptying on Wednesday. For months, thousands of men, women and children have been amassing at Belarus's western borders. Belarus has been accused of pushing migrants, mostly from the Middle East, to the border to destabilise the EU. Belarus's long-time authoritarian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, has repeatedly denied luring migrants to the border in revenge for EU sanctions. The border crisis reached boiling point on Tuesday after Polish forces used tear gas and water cannon to repel migrants trying to cross into the country. Some of the migrants attempted to breach a heavily fortified crossing and threw missiles at the Polish forces, leaving several with injuries. Watch the BBC's Steve Rosenberg at the scene of the chaos as water cannon and tear gas is used The migrants have been living in camps in freezing conditions and with little food or water just inside Belarus, stranded between Polish guards on one side and Belarusian guards on the other. But after more than a week of stalemate, Belarus said it had opened a temporary shelter for them in a transport and logistics centre near the Kuznica checkpoint, where in recent days, thousands have gathered, hoping for a way into Poland and the European Union. Belarusian state news agency Belta showed pictures of migrants lying on the floor of the facility with mattresses, blankets and food packages. Many in the group are Iraqi citizens, and the news agency said a lot of them still intended to enter the EU. ""We will not return to Iraq. It's very bad there. For the sake of the future of our children, we want to go to Germany,"" one woman said. Earlier, Poland's deputy interior minister Maciej Wasik said Mr Lukashenko had, for the first time, sent buses to collect migrants on the border. ""The camp near Kuznica is slowly emptying,"" Mr Wasik told Poland's TV Republika. Video footage from Poland's border guard agency appeared to show the migrants leaving the camp on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Iraqi Airways confirmed it would send a plane to Belarus on Thursday to take its citizens home. The EU has asked Middle Eastern countries to stop flights to Belarus and several have agreed. Poland, with EU backing, is determined not to let the migrants into the bloc and has warned that the border and humanitarian crisis may go on for months. ""We have to prepare for the fact that the situation on the Polish-Belarusian border will not be resolved quickly,"" Polish Defence Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said. European officials have accused Mr Lukashenko of orchestrating a scheme to entice migrants to the border with the false promise of easy entry into the EU. Calling the accusations ""absurd"", Mr Lukashenko's government has criticised the EU for not taking in the migrants and pushing them back at the border. Poland has been accused of pushing people back across the border into Belarus, contrary to international rules of asylum. EU-Belarus relations have been severely strained since Mr Lukashenko declared victory in a discredited presidential election last year and tried to silence dissenting voices. Outgoing German Chancellor Angela Merkel has tried to defuse the border crisis by discussing the issue with him several times this week, stressing the need to let the United Nations provide aid to the stranded migrants. He has previously threatened to retaliate to a new round of EU sanctions, which European officials approved earlier this week. On Wednesday, the Belarusian government said it would stop supplying electricity to Ukraine - an EU ally - within the next 24 hours. In a statement, the Belarusian government cited ""contractual relations"" as the reason for terminating electricity supplies.

REUTERS/Gleb Garanich MOSCOW, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Belarus on Saturday accused a Ukrainian military helicopter of flouting its border during manoeuvres and flying one kilometre (0.62 miles) into Belarusian territory. The state border service issued a statement and a video of what it said was the Ukrainian helicopter flying across a snowy, wooded area at a checkpoint. A spokesman for Ukraine's state border guard service said the allegation was false. The accusation comes amid wider tensions in the region, with Ukraine and its NATO allies accusing Russia of massing tens of thousands of troops near Ukraine's borders in what they say might be preparation for an attack. Russia denies any such plan. ""The Ukrainian Mi-8 military helicopter at an altitude of about 100 metres crossed the state border and flew to a depth of 1 km into the territory of Belarus. The Ukrainian side was informed about this incident,"" said the Belarusian statement. A spokesperson for Ukraine's border guard service denied the accusation. ""As part of strengthening the protection of the border with Belarus, aviation is used to monitor the border, but there have been no violations of the state border by aviation,"" spokesperson Andriy Demchenko said. Relations between Belarus and Ukraine have plummeted since last year, when Russia sided with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko during mass street protests and Lukashenko in turn became more vocal in his support for Moscow against Ukraine. Ukraine has accused Belarus and Russia of manufacturing a migrant crisis on the EU's eastern borders with Belarus that has  left thousands of people stranded in freezing conditions. Lukashenko denies orchestrating the migrant crisis and his government promised an ""asymmetrical"" response against a new round of sanctions imposed on Minsk on Thursday. He also signalled that Belarus could side with Russia in a military conflict with Ukraine and that he recognised Crimea - the territory annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014 - as Russian.  read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

A humanitarian convoy was hit by shelling, and pro-Russian rebels evacuated civilians from the conflict zone. A car bombing hit the eastern city of Donetsk, but no casualties were reported. After weeks of saying the U.S. wasn’t sure if Putin had made the final decision to invade, Biden said that assessment had changed, citing American intelligence. “As of this moment I’m convinced he’s made the decision,” Biden said. “We have reason to believe that.” He reiterated that the assault could occur in the “coming days.” Meanwhile, the Kremlin announced massive nuclear drills to flex its military muscle, and Putin pledged to protect Russia’s national interests against what it sees as encroaching Western threats. Biden reiterated his threat of massive economic and diplomatic sanctions against Russia if it does invade, and pressed Putin to rethink his course of action. He said the U.S. and its Western allies were more united than ever to ensure Russia pays a price for the invasion. With an estimated 150,000 Russian troops posted around Ukraine’s borders, U.S. and European officials warn that the long-simmering separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine could provide the spark for a broader attack. As further indication that the Russians are preparing for a potential invasion, a U.S. defense official said an estimated 40% to 50% of the ground forces deployed in the vicinity of the Ukrainian border have moved into attack positions nearer the border. That shift has been under way for about a week, other officials have said, and does not necessarily mean Putin has decided to begin an invasion. The defense official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal U.S. military assessments. The official also said the number of Russian ground units known as battalion tactical groups deployed in the border area had grown to as many as 125, up from 83 two weeks ago. Each battalion tactical group has 750 to 1,000 soldiers. Lines of communication remain open: The U.S. and Russian defense chiefs spoke Friday, and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin called for de-escalation, the return of Russian forces surrounding Ukraine to their home bases and a diplomatic resolution, according to the Pentagon. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov agreed to meet next week. Immediate worries focused on eastern Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces have been fighting pro-Russia rebels since 2014 in a conflict that has killed some 14,000 people. A bombing struck a car outside the main government building in the major eastern city of Donetsk, according to an Associated Press journalist there. The head of the separatist forces, Denis Sinenkov, said the car was his, the Interfax news agency reported. There were no reports of casualties and no independent confirmation of the circumstances of the blast. Uniformed men inspected the burned-out car. Shelling and shooting are common along the line that separates Ukrainian forces and the rebels, but targeted violence is unusual in rebel-held cities like Donetsk. However, the explosion and the announced evacuations were in line with U.S. warnings of so-called false-flag attacks that Russia would use to justify an invasion. Adding to the tensions, two explosions shook the rebel-controlled city of Luhansk early Saturday. The Luhansk Information Center said one of the blasts was in a natural gas main and cited witnesses as saying the other was at a vehicle service station. There was no immediate word on injuries or a cause. Luhansk officials blamed a gas main explosion earlier in the week on sabotage. Separatists in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions that form Ukraine’s industrial heartland known as the Donbas said they are evacuating civilians to Russia. The announcement appeared to be part of Moscow’s efforts to counter Western warnings of a Russian invasion and to paint Ukraine as the aggressor instead. Denis Pushilin, head of the Donetsk rebel government, said women, children and the elderly would go first, and that Russia has prepared facilities for them. Pushilin alleged in a video statement that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was going to order an imminent offensive in the area. Metadata from two videos posted by the separatists announcing the evacuation show that the files were created two days ago, The Associated Press confirmed. U.S. authorities have alleged that the Kremlin’s disinformation campaign could include prerecorded videos. Authorities began moving children from an orphanage in Donetsk, and other residents boarded buses for Russia. Long lines formed at gas stations as more people prepared to leave on their own. Putin ordered his emergencies minister to fly to the Rostov region bordering Ukraine to help organize the exodus and ordered the government to offer a payment of 10,000 rubles (about $130) to each evacuee, equivalent to about half of an average monthly salary in the war-ravaged Donbas. Ukraine denied planning any offensive. “We are fully committed to diplomatic conflict resolution only,” Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted. Around the volatile line of contact, a United Nations humanitarian convoy came under rebel shelling in the Luhansk region, Ukraine’s military chief said. No casualties were reported. Rebels denied involvement and accused Ukraine of staging a provocation. Separatist authorities reported more shelling by Ukrainian forces along the line. A surge of shelling Thursday tore through the walls of a kindergarten, injuring two, and basic communications were disrupted. Both sides accused each other of opening fire. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the threat to global security is “more complex and probably higher” than during the Cold War. He told the Munich conference that a small mistake or miscommunication between major powers could have catastrophic consequences. Russia announced this week that it was pulling back forces from vast military exercises, but U.S. officials said they saw no sign of a pullback — and instead saw more troops moving toward the border  with Ukraine. Meanwhile, the White House and the U.K. formally accused Russia of being responsible for recent cyberattacks targeting Ukraine’s defense ministry and major banks. The announcement was the most pointed attribution of responsibility for the cyber intrusions. Also Friday, the U.S. government released new estimates of how many military personnel Russia has in and around Ukraine. It said there are between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel, up from about about 100,000 on Jan. 30, according to Michael Carpenter, the permanent U.S. representative to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The new estimate includes military troops along the border, in Belarus and in occupied Crimea, as well as Russian National Guard and other internal security units, and Russian-backed forces in eastern Ukraine. The separatists inside Ukraine, the National Guard and troops in Crimea were not included in the previous U.S. estimate of 150,000. The Kremlin sent a reminder to the world of its nuclear might, announcing drills of its nuclear forces for the weekend. Putin will monitor the sweeping exercise Saturday that will involve multiple practice missile launches. Asked about Western warnings of a possible Russian invasion on Wednesday that didn’t materialize, Putin said: “There are so many false claims, and constantly reacting to them is more trouble than it’s worth.” “We are doing what we consider necessary and will keep doing so,” he said. “We have clear and precise goals conforming to national interests.” ___ Isachenkov reported from Moscow, Madhani from Munich and Miller from Washington.

The EU’s Eastern Partnership includes Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. The president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, is boycotting the forum due to EU sanctions over reported fraud in his reelection last year a security crackdown on antigovernment protesters that followed. A Belarus flag was left at the summit table where he would have sat. “There was an empty chair in the room, and I hope that this chair will soon be filled by a legitimate, democratically elected Belarusian leader,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. The Eastern Partnership was set up after Moscow sent troops into Georgia in 2008, stunning the Europeans and much of the world. It aims to improve and deepen relations among the six countries, most of which share borders with Russia and are strategically important energy hubs, as well as with the 27-nation EU. The meeting was intended to affirm the participants’ “strong commitment to our strategic, ambitious and forward-looking” partnership, based “on common fundamental values,” according to the final summit declaration. The 32 countries taking part said they “are bound by our joint determination to further strengthen democracy and the rule of law in our societies,” according to the text, which was released after five hours of talks in Brussels. The word “Russia” was not once mentioned in the nine-page declaration, despite Moscow’s opposition to any of the six countries involved in the partnership deepening ties with the EU. The EU announced that it would offer the Eastern countries a 2.3 billion-euro ($2.6 billion) economic and investment plan, which the bloc hopes will attract up to 17 billion euros ($19 billion) in public and private investments for the region. The EU also emphasized the need for “differentiation” — the acceptance that some of the six may be in a position to deepen their relations with the bloc more quickly. Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, for example, have free trade pacts that ease tariffs and other barriers to European trade. In 2014, Ukraine’s then president, Petro Poroshenko, signed its trade deal, ignoring vehement opposition from Moscow, and declared that his country wanted to join the EU. His pro-Russian predecessor was forced to flee Ukraine after his rejection of the free trade deal sparking months of pro-EU demonstrations.",western,1,406,95.55,56.22,11.76,37.99,27.07,30.05,79.06,56.9,45.32,6.16,2.96,0.25,0.74,0,1.23,0.74,3.2,17.98,9.36,4.68,15.02,4.68,1.72,5.67,0.25,9.36,6.16,5.17,9.85,2.96,1.97,5.17,5.42,0,5.42,0.25,0.74,1.48,0.99,0,2.46,0,4.19,2.46,1.23,0.99,0.49,0,0,0,0,0,12.07,6.16,0.99,0,0.99,0.25,2.71,4.93,0,0,0,1.23,6.16,4.93,1.23,0,3.94,0,0.25,2.71,1.97,0.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.25,0.74,0.49,0.25,0.25,0,0,0.49,0,1.72,8.62,0.49,0.25,7.64,0,0,0.25,3.45,3.94,1.72,1.72,0,0,0,0,0,18.97,4.19,7.39,0,0,0.99,6.4

While a Russian invasion of Ukraine did not materialize as feared, the United States and its allies maintained that the threat is still strong, with Europe’s security and economic stability in the balance. Russia has massed more than 150,000 troops east, north and south of Ukraine, according to Western estimates. Russian President Vladimir Putin has signaled that he wants a peaceful path out of the crisis, and U.S. President Joe Biden promised that the U.S. would continue to give diplomacy “every chance,” but he struck a skeptical tone about Moscow’s intentions. Biden also insisted that Washington and its allies would not “sacrifice basic principles” respecting Ukraine sovereignty. Russian Defense Ministry video showed a trainload of armored vehicles moving across a bridge away from Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula that Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. It also announced that more tank units were being loaded on trains to move back to their permanent bases after training exercises. But at the same time, Russia continued war games near Ukraine’s borders and across its vast territory. A senior U.S. administration official said the West detected that Russia had increased its force near Ukraine by 7,000 troops, with some arriving as recently as Wednesday, and that there had been a marked increase in false claims by Russians that the Kremlin might use as pretext for an invasion. The official said those claims included reports of unmarked graves of civilians allegedly killed by Ukrainian forces, statements that the U.S. and Ukraine are developing biological or chemical weapons, and claims that the West is funneling in guerrillas to kill Ukrainians. The official was not authorized to speak publicly about sensitive operations and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The official did not provide underlying evidence for the assertions. The U.S. and Europe are maintaining threats of harsh sanctions.  Trust between East and West remains elusive. “We haven’t seen a pullback,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told ABC News. “He (Putin) can pull the trigger. He can pull it today. He can pull it tomorrow. He can pull it next week. The forces are there if he wants to renew aggression against Ukraine.” State Department spokesman Ned Price said the U.S. had seen “more Russian forces, not fewer.” Asked why Russians would claim to be withdrawing when government intelligence, commercial satellite photos and social media videos showed no evidence of that, Price said: “This is the Russian playbook, to paint a picture publicly … while they do the opposite.” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance also had not seen “any withdrawal of Russian forces,” as did multiple European governments. Before chairing a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels, he said: “If they really start to withdraw forces, that’s something we will welcome, but that remains to be seen.” In the meantime, the alliance is examining this week how and when to rapidly dispatch troops and equipment  to countries closest to Russia and the Black Sea region should Moscow order an invasion. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy similarly dismissed the Russian withdrawal claims. “What is this? Rotations, withdrawal, returning back again,” he said on a visit to the southeastern city of Mariupol. “It’s too early to rejoice.” The Ukrainian leader has repeatedly sought to project calm as well as strength during the crisis, declaring Wednesday a “Day of National Unity.” “We are united by a desire to happily live in peace,” Zelenskyy said in an address to the nation earlier in the day. “We can defend our home only if we stay united.” Across the country, Ukrainians of all ages waved flags in the streets and from apartment windows. Hundreds unfolded a 200-meter (650-foot) flag at Kyiv’s Olympic Stadium, while another was draped in the center of a shopping mall in the capital. In the government-controlled part of Ukraine’s eastern region of Luhansk, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian troops since 2014, residents stretched another huge flag across a street. “This event, this number of people united around Ukrainian flag will show that we stand for united Ukraine,” said resident Olena Tkachova. A 2015 deal brokered by France and Germany helped end the worst of the fighting in eastern Ukraine, but implementation has stalled. The deal, known as the Minsk agreement, would offer broad self-rule to the separatist territories and thus is resented by many in Ukraine. A Ukrainian government official said in a television interview that Zelenskyy would consider holding a referendum on the Minsk agreement “if there are no other options or instruments.” But Vice Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said she was unaware that such an idea was under serious discussion. Russia has repeatedly complained that the U.S. and NATO have not responded satisfactorily in writing to its security concerns. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Wednesday that Russia is in the final phase of preparing its formal response to the West. “After that, a schedule of further steps will be developed,” she said on state television. The Kremlin wants the West to keep Ukraine and other former Soviet nations out of NATO, halt weapons deployments near Russian borders and roll back forces from Eastern Europe. The U.S. and its allies have roundly rejected those demands, but they offered to engage in talks with Russia on ways to bolster security in Europe. For now, Russia is flexing its muscle. Russian fighter jets flew training missions Wednesday over neighboring Belarus and paratroopers held shooting drills at firing ranges there as part of massive war games that the West feared could be used as cover for an invasion of Ukraine. Belarusian Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei reaffirmed that all Russian troops and weapons will leave the country when the maneuvers end Sunday. Maxar Technologies, a commercial satellite imagery company that has been monitoring the Russian buildup, reported Wednesday that new photos show heightened Russian military activity near Ukraine, including the construction of a pontoon bridge in Belarus less than 6 kilometers (4 miles) from the Ukrainian border. Russia has mocked Western warnings about an imminent invasion  as “paranoia” and “madness.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov pointed sarcastically at warnings of an invasion that could start Wednesday, saying that Russian officials had a good sleep. Asked by German daily Welt if Russia was going to attack Wednesday, Russia’s ambassador to the European Union, Vladimir Chizhov, quipped: “Wars in Europe rarely start on a Wednesday.” “There won’t be an escalation next week either, on in the week after, or in the coming month,” he said. But British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace told Sky News that instead of a Russian withdrawal, “we’ve seen continued buildup of things like field hospitals and strategic weapons systems.” The White House will lean on Vice President Kamala Harris to help with diplomatic efforts when she travels to Germany to take part in this weekend’s Munich Security Conference, officials said. Harris is scheduled to meet Friday with Stoltenberg and hold a multilateral meeting with the leaders of the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. She’s also scheduled to deliver a major address Saturday on the administration’s efforts to stop Russian aggression. After the speech, Harris is slated to meet with Zelenskyy and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. ___ Isachenkov reported Moscow and Cook from Brussels.

President Alexander Lukashenko announced the expected acquisition as Russia and Belarus prepare to conduct joint war games starting next week that are set to involve about 200,000 troops. The announcement highlights Moscow’s growing support for Lukashenko, whose election to a sixth term in August 2020 triggered months of protests and allegations of a rigged vote from the Belarusian opposition and the West. Russia has staunchly backed the longtime president as his government faced a series of bruising sanctions from the United States and the European Union. The sanctions were imposed in response to a brutal crackdown on the post-election protests, including the arrests of more than 35,000 people and police beating thousands of demonstrators. Seeking to secure Moscow’s support, Lukashenko has cast the sanctions as part of an alleged plot by the West to oust him and undermine Russia. He has described this month’s upcoming military exercises as part of joint efforts to counter Western pressure. “We effectively have a single army, with the Belarusian military forming its backbone in the western direction,” Lukashenko said. “If, God forbid, a war starts, the Belarusian army will be the first to engage in the fight, and the western group of Russia’s armed forces will join quickly after to form a joint defense.” Moscow has granted Belarus a new $1.5 billion loan and criticized Western restrictions. Lukashenko said that Russia also will shortly provide Belarus with dozens of warplanes and helicopters and air defense weapons, possibly including the state-of-the-art S-400 missile system. “We even could get the S-400s. We badly need them,” he said. The two ex-Soviet neighbors have a union agreement that envisages close political, economic and military ties. In the past, Lukashenko often accused Moscow of forging plots to force Belarus abandon its independence, but he has dropped such rhetoric after his crackdown on protest made him a pariah in the West and forced him to rely squarely on the Kremlin’s support. Lukashenko said Wednesday that he would discuss a package of agreements intended to bolster Russia-Belarus integration during a visit to Russia next week, but he emphasized that it would not erode Belarus’ independence. “There is no talk about the loss of sovereignty,” he said. But despite his assurances, the planned maneuvers and Lukashenko’s efforts to forge closer ties with Russia have fueled concerns of the Belarusian opposition that the president might sacrifice the country’s independence in exchange for Moscow’s support. “Lukashenko is getting drawn into a military confrontation with the West and is trading in sovereignty, but his legitimacy is dubious and we won’t recognize any documents or treaties that would give up or limit Belarus’ sovereignty,” Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the main opposition challenger in the August 2020 election, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. “Any agreements with Russia that would deprive us of an independent future will be reviewed.” ___ Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow contributed to this report.",western,1,514,93.2,56.31,7.33,4.78,24.48,34.63,78.4,56.23,45.14,6.61,3.89,0,0.97,0,2.53,0.19,2.72,15.95,10.12,2.92,14.01,5.45,2.33,6.03,0.58,10.31,4.86,3.89,11.09,1.75,1.56,7.78,8.56,0.19,8.17,0.58,1.17,1.17,1.95,0.19,3.31,0,5.25,1.56,3.5,0.58,0,0.39,0,0.19,0,0,12.65,6.81,0.97,0,2.33,0.39,3.11,5.64,0,0,0,2.53,6.81,5.64,0.97,0.19,2.53,0.19,0.19,1.36,0.58,0.39,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.19,0,0.78,0.19,0,0,0,0.39,0,2.33,5.64,0.19,0.19,5.25,0,0,0,4.47,2.72,2.33,2.72,0,0,0,0,0,17.12,4.28,5.06,0,0,2.14,5.64

The Viasna human rights center said the detentions took place in the capital, Minsk, and seven other cities and appeared to be connected to comments made on social media about the incident. It said those arrested face charges of insulting government officials and inciting “social enmity,” which carry sentences of up to 12 years in prison. Belarusian authorities reported the incident on Tuesday night, alleging that “an especially dangerous criminal” opened fire on security officers after they showed up at his apartment looking for “individuals involved in terrorist activities.” Authorities said one of officers of the Belarus state security service, or KGB, was killed and the perpetrator was killed by return fire. A large U.S.-based IT company founded by Belarusians, EPAM Systems, said the dead civilian was its employee Andrei Zeltser. EPAM last year started a program to train Belarusian IT workers who lost their jobs for supporting the massive protests that broke out against authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko after elections opponents called a sham in August 2020. Lukashenko on Friday held a minute of silence during a meeting with presidential administration officials in honor of the dead KGB officer and vowed to “not forgive the death of this guy.” Earlier this week, the deputy head of Belarus’ Interior Ministry, Nikolai Karpyankov, in televised remarks called for mass detentions of those who commented on the incident on social media, denouncing them as “absolute freaks.” Top Belarus opposition activist Pavel Latushko told The Associated Press that “a fair investigation (of the incident) is impossible under Lukashenko.” “Not only Andrei Zeltser — a calm, kind and compassionate man — has been declared a terrorist. All of those who disagree with the regime have been declared terrorists,” Latushko told the AP from Warsaw, where he is currently in exile. On Wednesday, the Belarusian Ministry of Information blocked access to the website of Komsomolskaya Pravda in Belarus — the Belarusian subsidiary of a popular Russian newspaper of the same name. The ministry didn’t provide any reasons for the decision to block the website, which is visited by some 20,000 users daily, but access to it was restricted several hours after it ran a story about the shootout, which featured a comment from the dead civilian’s friend, who described him a positive light. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Friday said the Russian authorities “categorically disagree” with the move. “We believe that it violates the principles of media freedom. We would expect the Belarusian side to ensure conditions for the work of our media outlets,” Peskov said. ___ Daria Litvinova in Moscow contributed reporting.",western,1,459,97.87,62.05,22.42,3.15,25.5,32.24,80.39,53.81,42.05,7.41,2.83,0,0.65,0,0.65,0.65,4.58,15.69,10.46,1.31,15.47,3.49,1.31,2.83,0.65,9.37,5.45,2.83,8.71,1.31,0.65,6.75,5.23,0.22,5.01,1.09,0.87,0.22,0.44,0,2.61,0,5.01,1.31,3.7,0.65,0.22,0.44,0,0.44,0,0,16.78,9.59,0.65,0,1.96,1.53,5.45,6.32,0,0,0,1.31,5.88,3.05,1.53,1.31,2.83,0,0.22,2.61,0,0,2.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.53,0,0,0.22,0,0,0,0,0.87,0.44,2.4,8.06,0.65,0.87,5.88,1.09,0.22,0,4.36,7.41,1.31,0.22,0,0,0,0,0,15.9,4.36,5.01,0,0,0.87,5.66

The proposed amendments are published on the president’s official website and the website of the state news agency Belta, and Belarusians are encouraged to submit their comments, suggestions and opinions about the changes. The amendments bring back limits on presidential terms that had been abolished during Lukashenko’s tenure, allowing a president only two five-year terms in office. The restriction, however, will only take effect once a “newly elected president” assumes office, which gives Lukashenko an opportunity to run for two more terms after his current term expires in 2025. “Lukashenko opened a path to the presidency for himself until at least 2035, when he will be 81 years old,” independent political analyst Valery Karbalevich told The Associated Press. Other changes to the constitution include extending the parliament’s term from four years to five, introducing the All-Belarus People’s Assembly as a new body to operate in parallel with the parliament and granting former presidents immunity from prosecution over actions they took while in office. The amendments will be up for a referendum, scheduled for February 2022. They will be considered approved if more than 50% vote for them, with a turnout threshold at 50%. During his 27 years leading the former Soviet republic with an iron fist, Lukashenko has held three referendums, abolishing limits on presidential terms, amending the constitution and bringing back Soviet-looking state symbols. Belarus was rocked by months of unprecedented mass protests after Lukashenko was awarded a sixth consecutive term in office in the August 2020 presidential vote, which the opposition and the West denounced as a sham. He responded to the demonstrations with a brutal crackdown that saw more than 35,000 people arrested, thousands beaten by police and many forced to seek refuge abroad. The proposed constitutional changes were being drafted during the turmoil, when Lukashenko realized “that he lost the support of the majority of the country’s urban population,” Karbalevich pointed out. The new governing body — the All-Belarus People’s Assembly — was designed as a backup plan for the authoritarian leader if he is forced to step down as president, the analyst said. According to the proposed amendments, a sitting president automatically becomes a delegate of the 1,200-seat Assembly and may chair it, if elected by other delegates. The new proposed body is expected to meet at least once a year and will be empowered to set policy directives, draft laws, suggest constitutional changes, elect members of the country’s Central Election Commission and judges of the country’s highest courts. The Assembly can also green-light deploying Belarusian troops abroad if proposed by the president, and oust the president if the leader is found to be in violation of the constitution or to have committed high treason or another major crime. “Lukashenko designed the All-Belarus Assembly for himself as a backup airfield in case of stepping down as president,” Karbalevich said. But the need for that dissipated as the protests were suppressed and Russia, Belarus’ powerful ally, cast its support behind Lukashenko. “So in the proposed amendments we see a hybrid — both the opportunity to get reelected as president until 2035, and the opportunity to remain in power as a possible leader of the All-Belarus Assembly,” the analyst said. The amendments also scrap clauses about Belarus’ “neutrality” and “non-nuclear status.” Last month, Lukashenko offered to host Russia’s nuclear weapons if NATO moves U.S. atomic bombs from Germany to Eastern Europe, the latest in a series of steps aimed at cementing ties with Moscow. Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who ran against Lukashenko in the August 2020 election and was pressured to leave the country shortly after, criticized the proposed amendments on Monday. In a statement on the messaging app Telegram, Tsikhanouskaya said that Belarusians are offered to choose “between Lukashenko and Lukashenko.” “It’s a lie no one will believe in. Choosing between Lukashenko and Lukashenko is impossible. And we won’t choose him, like we didn’t choose him last year,” she said. Tsikhnaouskaya added that “Lukashenko is trying to prescribe himself immunity from criminal prosecution, powers to strip Belarusians of their citizenship and appoint a new Politburo embodied in the All-Belarus People’s Assembly that no one has elected.” She urged Belarusians to “cross all the proposed options off the ballot.”",western,1,743,96.19,54.51,34.21,21.89,26.54,33.24,79.95,56.12,45.36,5.25,3.1,0,0.4,0,1.88,0.67,2.15,15.88,10.77,3.1,16.15,4.98,2.02,7.27,0.54,10.77,4.85,4.44,10.09,0.94,1.21,8.08,8.34,0.67,7.4,1.62,1.48,0.4,1.75,0,3.23,0,3.63,1.88,1.75,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.84,6.06,0.81,0,0.94,0.4,2.29,5.79,0,0.13,0.27,1.75,6.06,5.11,0.4,0.54,2.83,0,0,2.69,0,0.13,0.81,0.4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.13,0,0.4,0,0,0,0.54,0,0,2.56,7.67,0.4,1.21,5.65,0.27,0,0.13,6.46,4.58,2.02,2.69,0,0,0,0,0,16.69,4.04,5.52,0,0,2.29,4.85

The announcements came at a time of high tension between the two countries, with NATO meeting for the second day to discuss a Russian troop build-up that Kyiv fears may be a prelude to an invasion. Moscow has consistently denied that, and sought to portray Ukraine and NATO as the aggressors. ""The Ukrainian army is building up its military strength, bringing in hardware and personnel,"" said Maria Zakharova, spokesperson for the Russian foreign ministry. She said according to some reports, the number of troops in the conflict zone had already reached 125,000 people, ""which is half of the entire Ukrainian army."" The Ukrainian military declined to comment on Zakharova's statement. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow was alarmed by Kyiv's bolstering its forces in the Donbass region and he would discuss the situation with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken at a meeting in Stockholm on Thursday. Moscow's defence ministry said the Russian winter drills would involve 10,000 troops across more than 30 training grounds. They would also take place in Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, and in a Russian region bordering the separatist-controlled Donbass area of eastern Ukraine. Russia's ally Belarus has also announced joint military drills with Russia on its southern border with Ukraine.  read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

235,bbc.co.uk,2022-02-14 08:00:00,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60379833,Ukraine crisis : Russia says diplomatic solution still possible,English,United Kingdom,"Russia has said that a diplomatic solution to its escalating standoff with the West is still possible. In a televised meeting, President Vladimir Putin was told that diplomatic talks had not yet been been exhausted. The comments come after more than a dozen nations urged their citizens to leave Ukraine, and the US said aerial bombardments could begin ""at any time"". Russia has always denied plans to invade Ukraine, despite massing more than 100,000 troops on the border. Separately, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was still time for Russia to ""step back"" from the situation with Ukraine, urging all sides to carry on talking. A statement said Mr Johnson would hold a Cobra meeting on Tuesday to discuss the UK's response to the pressures. During another socially-distanced TV appearance on Monday, Mr Putin asked his Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov if there was a chance to reach an agreement with the West, or whether the diplomacy was ""an attempt to drag us into an endless negotiation process?"" Mr Lavrov replied that the ""possibilities are far from being exhausted, they certainly should not continue indefinitely, but I would suggest continuing and ramping them up"". The comments are being seen as a clear concession that talks could ease the tensions. But analysts say that without either side moving over the thorny issue of Ukraine potentially joining Nato, there is still deadlock. The Kremlin says it cannot accept that Ukraine - a former Soviet republic with deep social and cultural ties with Russia - could one day join Nato, and has demanded that this be ruled out. Nato's members have rejected this request. Also at the Kremlin meeting - in what some observers see as another possible route to easing tensions - Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu told Mr Putin that some of the country's military drills near Ukraine's border had already ended and others were coming to a close. Russia is holding massive joint exercises with Belarus, Ukraine's northern neighbour. Moscow is also staging Navy shooting drills in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov - to the south of Ukraine. In some quarters of the world, President Putin's question would have elicited a collective intake of breath. The Russian President asked his Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov whether there was a chance of reaching an agreement on Russia's security concerns or if this was simply endless negotiation. Many would fear what would happen if Mr Lavrov said no. His answer has made some feel slightly more reassured - there is a chance. Throughout the weeks of diplomacy, one of the West's biggest fears is what happens if Russia walks away from the diplomatic table. Politicians have been arriving in sequence in Moscow, creating a metaphorical human chain to keep the diplomatic ball in the air. However, it's still unclear what both sides can agree on to break the deadlock and deescalate the situation. Russia says it wants a guarantee Nato won't allow Ukraine to join the alliance, but Nato won't give in to that. Neither side has moved on this issue so while diplomacy continues, so does the deadlock on a deal. Meanwhile, Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz landed in Kyiv on Monday for crisis talks - the latest Western leader to visit the region to show unity with Ukraine. Mr Scholz said there was ""no reasonable justification"" for the Russian military build-up on Ukraine's borders and that Western countries would impose ""very far-reaching and effective sanctions"" against Russia if it invaded. Later Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree declaring 16 February a day of unity. The date has been suggested by US officials as the earliest day for a potential attack by Russia. In a rousing statement, Mr Zelensky said that Ukrainians ""want freedom and are ready to fight for it"". BBC diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams says that the tone of the statement was markedly different from previous ones, in which the president has called for calm and warned against panic. Also on Monday the US said it had sent eight more F-15 fighter jets to Poland to take part in Nato air patrols. The US earlier said an extra 3,000 soldiers would be sent to Poland in the next few days to boost Nato military strength in the region.

Putin’s statement on Tuesday added to signs of easing tensions over a Russian military buildup near Ukraine and fears of a possible invasion. Hours earlier, Russia announced that some units participating in military exercises would begin returning to their bases. But U.S. President Joe Biden said the U.S. had not verified Russia’s claim and that an invasion was still a distinct possibility. He said the U.S. would give diplomacy “every chance” to prevent a Russian invasion, but he struck a skeptical tone about Moscow’s intentions. Much remains unclear about Russia’s plans and how the crisis will play out. Here’s a look at what is happening where and why: WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH RUSSIAN TROOPS? Russia’s Defense Ministry announced that some units participating in exercises would begin returning to their bases. But it wasn’t immediately clear where exactly these troops were deployed or how many were leaving. The announcement came a day after Western officials said some forces and military hardware were moving toward the Ukrainian border, muddying the picture. Russia denies it has any plans to invade Ukraine, despite placing troops on Ukraine’s borders to the north, south and east and holding major exercises. Biden said 150,000 Russian forces are now massed near Ukraine and in neighboring Belarus, an increase from an earlier U.S. estimate of 130,000 troops. HOW DO OTHERS SEE THAT? Speaking alongside Putin in Moscow, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said: “That we are now hearing that some troops are being withdrawn is in any case a good signal, and we hope that more will follow.” Scholz didn’t say whether Germany had any evidence a troop pullback was in fact happening. Ukraine’s leaders voiced skepticism, and others also were cautious. “Russia constantly makes various statements,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said. “That’s why we have the rule: We won’t believe when we hear, we’ll believe when we see. When we see troops pulling out, we’ll believe in de-escalation.” French government spokesman Gabriel Attal said France was trying to confirm the information about Russian troop movements and he would speak “carefully.” “But if confirmed, that’s obviously a good thing. That would be a sign of de-escalation, which we have been calling for for several weeks. That would also confirm that we were right to reinitiate dialogue,” Attal said. French President Emmanuel Macron met with Putin in Moscow last week and spoke with Biden on Tuesday. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that “so far, we have not seen any de-escalation on the ground, not seen any signs of reduced Russian military presence on the borders of Ukraine.” Stoltenberg said Russia has in the past moved into areas, like Belarus, with troops and equipment, then pulled back while leaving military material in place for rapid use later. He said that NATO wants to see a “significant and enduring withdrawal of forces, troops, and not least the heavy equipment.” However, Stoltenberg said there are “some grounds for cautious optimism” for diplomatic efforts given the signals coming from Moscow. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Russia was sending “mixed signals.” “We are seeing Russian openness to conversations,” Johnson said after a meeting of his government’s COBRA crisis committee. “On the other hand, the intelligence we are seeing today is still not encouraging.” He said Russia continued to build field hospitals in Belarus near the Ukrainian border, which “can only be construed as preparation for an invasion.” WHAT IS PUTIN SAYING? Putin noted after his talks with Germany’s Scholz that the U.S. and NATO rejected Moscow’s demand to keep Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations out of NATO, halt weapons deployments near Russian borders and to roll back alliance forces from Eastern Europe. But the U.S. and NATO agreed to discuss a range of security measures that Russia had previously proposed. Putin said Russia was ready to engage in talks on limiting the deployment of intermediate range missiles in Europe, transparency of drills and other confidence-building measures. But he reemphasized the need for the West to heed Russia’s main demands. WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING ON THE DIPLOMATIC FRONT? Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau of Poland, currently the chair of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, met Lavrov in Moscow. Rau said the OSCE has offered multilateral talks aimed at easing tensions. Ukraine’s foreign minister hosted his Italian counterpart. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said he conveyed to Zelenskyy during a phone call Japan’s strong support for diplomatic efforts and sanctions against Russia in case of aggression. WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE LATEST CYBERATTACKS? A series of cyberattacks on Tuesday knocked the websites of the Ukrainian army, the defense ministry and major banks offline, Ukrainian authorities said. Still, there was no indication the relatively low-level distributed-denial-of-service attacks might be a smokescreen for more serious and damaging cyber mischief. At least 10 Ukrainian websites were unreachable, including those of the Defense Ministry, the Foreign Ministry, the Culture Ministry and Ukraine’s two largest state banks. The Ukrainian Information Ministry’s Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security suggested Russia could be behind the attacks. But quick attribution in cyberattacks is typically difficult, as aggressors often try to hide their tracks. Ukraine has been subject to a steady diet of Russian aggression in cyberspace. WHAT DOES THE U.S. SENATE HAVE TO SAY? In a rare bipartisan accord, Senate leaders issued a joint statement Tuesday signaling solidarity with an independent Ukraine and issuing a stern warning that Russia would pay a “severe price” of sanctions if it invades. Senators of both parties have been eager to show a unified front from the U.S. But they shelved for now their own sanctions legislation, unable to resolve differences over the scope and timing and deferring to the White House strategy for edging Russia away from the crisis. “In this dark hour,” the 12 Democratic and Republican senators declared, they wanted to make sure the strong U.S. position was clear to the people of Ukraine and to Putin. WHAT DO RUSSIAN LAWMAKERS WANT? Russian lawmakers called on Putin to recognize rebel-held areas in eastern Ukraine, the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics, as independent states. The State Duma, Russia’s lower house of parliament, voted Tuesday to submit an appeal to Putin to that effect, put forward earlier by Russia’s Communist Party. Kyiv isn’t fulfilling the Minsk agreements, mediated by Germany and France in an effort to bring peace to eastern Ukraine, and “our citizens and compatriots that live in Donbas need help and support,” State Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin said on the Telegram messaging app. Volodin said the document will be submitted to Putin “immediately.” Putin said the motion reflects the Russian public’s concern about people living in eastern Ukraine. He noted, however, that Russia continues to believe that a 2015 peace deal brokered by France and Germany should serve as the main vehicle for resolving disputes over eastern Ukraine. Scholz said a process to shore up that agreement “should be supported by everyone and held up by no one.” “Of course, if the resolution the (Russian) parliament agreed to today became reality, that would mean flouting the Minsk agreement,” Scholz added. “I think all involved know that … then the process would be broken off and ended, and that would be a political catastrophe.” WHAT’S THE FEELING IN MOSCOW? While the U.S. has warned that Russia could invade Ukraine any day, the drumbeat of war is  all but unheard in Moscow, where pundits and ordinary people alike don’t expect Putin to attack Russia’s ex-Soviet neighbor. The Kremlin has cast the U.S. warnings of an imminent attack as “hysteria” and “absurdity,” and many Russians believe that Washington is deliberately stoking panic and fomenting tensions to trigger a conflict for domestic reasons. Putin’s angry rhetoric about NATO’s plans to expand to Russia’s “doorstep” and its refusal to hear Moscow’s concerns has struck a chord with the public, tapping into a sense of betrayal by the West after the end of the Cold War and widespread suspicion about Western designs. ___ Dasha Litvinova in Moscow, Yuras Karmanau in Kyiv, Ukraine, Sylvie Corbet in Paris, Lorne Cook in Brussels, Jill Lawless in London and Lolita C.

The urgent efforts come as 100,000 Russian troops are massed near Ukraine’s border and the Biden administration worries  that Russian President Vladimir Putin will mount some sort of invasion within weeks. Here are things to know about the international tensions surrounding Ukraine. PENTAGON LAYS OUT MILITARY OPTIONS Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Friday the buildup of Russian forces along Ukraine’s border has reached the point where President Vladimir Putin now has a complete range of military options, including actions short of a full-scale invasion. “While we don’t believe that President Putin has made a final decision to use these forces against Ukraine, he clearly now has the capability,” Austin told a Pentagon news conference. Austin said Putin could use any portion of his force of an estimated 100,000 troops to seize Ukrainian cities and “significant territories” or to carry out “coercive acts or provocative political acts” like the recognition of breakaway territories inside Ukraine. Austin spoke alongside Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in a news conference that marked a subtle shift in the administration’s approach to public communications about the Ukraine crisis, which until now has focused on the the diplomatic efforts. Milley said Russian forces near Ukraine include not only ground troops and naval and air forces but also cyber and electronic warfare capabilities, as well as special operations forces. But he also noted that Ukraine’s military has improved significantly over the past several years, adding, “If Russia chooses to invade Ukraine, it will not be cost free, in terms of casualties and other significant effects,” Milley said. ___ A DIPLOMATIC DEADLOCK The Kremlin said Putin told French President Emmanuel Macron that the West has failed to consider Russia’s key conditions of halting further NATO expansion, stopping the deployment of alliance weapons near Russian borders, and rolling back its forces from Eastern Europe. Putin told Macron that Moscow will study the U.S. and NATO response before deciding its next move, according to a Kremlin account of their call. A French official said Macron and Putin talked for over an hour Friday and spoke “about the necessity of de-escalation.” The official, who spoke on customary condition of anonymity, said that in the call Putin expressed commitment to the yearslong series of talks between Ukraine and Russia, with a new meeting expected in Berlin in two weeks. But he made no concessions. Putin has made no public remarks about the Western written response to the Russian demands, but Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said it leaves little chance for reaching agreement. He said Moscow will not start a war but also won’t allow the West to trample on its security interests. He noted, however, that the U.S. has suggested the two sides could talk about other issues of importance. Those include limits on the deployment of intermediate-range missiles, restrictions on military drills and rules to prevent accidents between warships and aircraft. ___ RUSSIA SUSPENDS MILITARY INSPECTIONS Germany expressed regret that Russia has suspended mutual military inspections at a time of heightened tensions. They are intended as confidence-building measures among members of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said Russia recently announced it would suspend the inspections until the end of February, citing the spread of the omicron variant. “Because of this an inspection on Russian territory in the border region of Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, which Russia had previously agreed to, won’t currently be possible,” said the spokesman, Christofer Burger. “We expressly regret this step because particularly in the current situation anything which creates greater transparency would help reduce tensions,” he said. Burger said Russia also canceled inspections it was due to conduct in Germany. ___ EXPOSING DISINFORMATION HAS ITS RISKS In a break from the past, the U.S. and its allies are increasingly revealing their intelligence findings, looking to expose Putin’s plans on Ukraine and deflect his efforts to shape world opinion. The White House in recent weeks publicized what it said was a Russian “false-flag” operation to create a pretext for an invasion. Britain named Ukrainians it accused of having ties to Russian intelligence officers plotting to overthrow Zelenskyy. The U.S. also released a map of Russian military positions and detailed how officials believe Russia will try to attack Ukraine with as many as 175,000 troops. But the release of information isn’t without risks. Intelligence assessments carry varying degrees of certainty, and beyond offering photos of troop movements, the U.S. and its allies have provided little other proof. Moscow has invoked past American intelligence failures, including false information put forward about Iraq’s weapons programs. ___ WHAT ABOUT THOSE GERMAN HOWITZERS? German government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit says a decision had not yet been reached on whether to approve Estonia’s request to transfer artillery guns to Ukraine. Germany originally owned the howitzers and sold them to Finland which then sold them to Estonia. Hebestreit on Friday warned against I’m pursuing what he called a “military logic” amid demands for German approval to deliver the howitzers to Ukraine. “When push comes to shove that wouldn’t be a real solution either,” Hebestreit said. “That’s no game changer now.” —— WILL RUSSIAN GAS KEEP FLOWING? Germany says Russia remains a reliable natural gas supplier, but is still preparing for all scenarios. Government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit made the remark on Friday amid concerns that Russia might cut natural gas supplies to Europe. “In our view the Russian gas supply contracts are being fulfilled everywhere so far and we strongly assume that this will remain the case,” Hebestreit said. “At the same time it’s clear that one needs to prepare for all eventualities, and this is what the German government is doing,” he added. ___ CAN THE US HELP EUROPE WITH GAS SUPPLIES? President Joe Biden and European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said they were working to ensure “reliable and affordable energy supplies” to the EU. Their joint declaration comes as concerns rise that Russia could cut or stem its gas supplies to Europe. The issue is expected to be at the center of talks when the U.S.-EU Energy Council meets on February 7. “The United States and the EU are working jointly towards continued, sufficient, and timely supply of natural gas to the EU from diverse sources across the globe to avoid supply shocks, including those that could result from a further Russian invasion of Ukraine,” Biden and von der Leyen said. ___ HOW IS THE UK BOOSTING ITS CYBER DEFENSES? The U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre is urging businesses to strengthen computer network protection amid the Ukraine crisis. It said Friday it’s investigating recent reports of “malicious cyber incidents” in Ukraine and that these attacks are similar to a pattern of Russian behavior during earlier conflicts. While authorities aren’t aware of any specific threats against the U.K., the center is encouraging large organizations to bolster online defenses. The center is part of GCHQ, Britain’s signals intelligence agency. ___ HOW ARE TENSIONS AFFECTING BUSINESS? Germany’s Foreign Ministry says it has denied a retired diplomat permission to work for a subsidiary of the Russian-owned gas pipeline operator. “An internal review concluded that the taking on of this role had to be denied, because it would have encroached on official interests,” a ministry spokesman said Friday. Meanwhile, Italian bank UniCredit  also decided not to pursue a possible takeover bid for Russian bank Otrkitie due to Ukraine tensions. CEO Andrea Orcel said in a media call Friday that UniCredit had started due diligence on an offer, but “given the geopolitical environment, we decided to withdraw.” ___ Associated Press writers Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow, Frank Jordans in Berlin, Colleen Barry in Milan, Danica Kirka in London, Nomaan Merchant and Lolita Baldor in Washington and Lori Hinnant in Paris contributed.",western,1,1307,90.14,43.21,39.68,19.32,22.15,32.29,78.65,54.48,41.55,6.43,1.99,0.08,0.38,0.15,0.77,0.54,4.44,12.39,7.8,0.54,14.15,5.59,2.98,5.43,1.07,12.39,5.43,1.99,7.96,1.45,1.45,5.13,10.56,0.46,10.1,2.6,2.3,1.07,1.38,0.15,3.06,0,3.44,1.68,1.76,0.31,0,0.31,0.08,0.08,0.15,0,10.1,6.2,0.61,0.23,0.54,0.08,4.21,4.21,0,0,0,1.15,5.43,3.06,1.91,0.46,3.98,0.08,0.08,3.52,0.77,0,0.23,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.15,0.08,0.54,0,0.15,0.15,0.23,0,0,0.99,0.31,2.6,9.64,0.84,1.53,7.04,0.38,0,0.38,4.21,5.05,4.21,1.15,0.31,0.31,0.15,0,0,17.14,5.36,4.44,0.38,0,1.61,5.36

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was responding to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg’s comment this month that the alliance would need to consider relocating nuclear weapons east if the new German government changes the country’s policy on nuclear sharing. Lavrov described Stoltenberg’s statement as “absolutely irresponsible” and “outrageous.” “It’s not just fanning confrontation. It’s an attempt to provoke a hot conflict,” the minister said, speaking to members of the upper house of Russia’s parliament. Relations  between Russia and NATO sank to post-Cold War lows after Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and supported a separatist insurgency that started the same year in eastern Ukraine. Tensions escalated last month amid Ukrainian and Western concerns about a Russian troop buildup near Ukraine that raised fears that Moscow could invade its neighbor. The longtime leader of Belarus, President Alexander Lukashenko, said in a Tuesday interview that his country would be willing to host Russian nuclear weapons if NATO redeployed U.S. atomic bombs from Germany to Eastern Europe. Lavrov described Lukashenko’s offer as a “serious warning prompted by the reckless Western policy.”",western,1,212,92.41,51.31,23.57,1,23.56,42.45,77.36,51.42,33.96,5.66,0.94,0,0,0,0.47,0.47,4.72,11.79,7.08,0.47,12.26,4.25,1.42,5.19,0.47,10.38,8.96,1.89,9.43,2.36,0.94,6.13,8.49,0,8.49,0.47,1.89,2.36,1.42,0.47,3.3,0,7.55,1.42,6.13,0.94,0,0.94,0.47,0.47,0,0,16.98,10.85,0.94,0,1.89,1.42,5.19,5.66,0,0,0,0.94,11.32,7.55,2.36,1.42,2.36,0,0.47,1.89,0,0,0.47,0.47,0,0.47,0,0,0,0,0,0.47,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.42,0,1.89,10.85,0.94,1.42,7.55,0,0,0.94,4.25,2.83,0.94,0,0.47,0,0.47,0,0,17.92,6.13,2.36,0,0,4.25,5.19

Ambassador Nicolas de Lacoste’s departure on Sunday was due to the “unilateral decision” of Belarusian authorities, the French Foreign Ministry said. De Lacoste bade a farewell in a message posted Monday on YouTube urging Belarusians to “never lose hope.” Local media say the move to kick the ambassador out was linked to the refusal by France and other European Union countries to recognize Lukashenko’s re-election in August 2020, after an election marred by fraud and a violent police crackdown on post-election protesters. De Lacoste had also met with Belarusian opposition figures. The Belarusian Foreign Ministry said the ambassador’s emergency departure was connected with his unwillingness to present his credentials to Lukashenko. “The head of the French diplomatic mission did not express readiness to complete the procedure for assuming office as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Republic of Belarus, which is stipulated by international law and generally recognized practice,” said Anatoly Glaz, press secretary for the Belarusian Foreign Ministry. France’s Foreign Ministry explained that de Lacoste did not present his credentials to Lukashenko because it was “in line with the common European position of not recognizing the legitimacy of the outcome of the August 2020 presidential election.” Lukashenko claimed victory but the election was marred by widespread voter fraud and considered a sham by opposition supporters and Western governments. In months of subsequent protests, more than 35,000 people were arrested and thousands beaten by police, and the EU slapped sanctions on Belarus in response. The French ambassador arrived in the Belarusian capital of Minsk after the controversial election. In December, he handed copies of his credentials to the Belarusian foreign minister but did not want to meet with Lukashenko. De Lacoste met with representatives of civil society and politicians in Belarus, including activists from the opposition “Tell the Truth” movement, which was shut down by the authorities. On Saturday, he also met with Belarus’ first post-Soviet leader, Stanislav Shushkevich, who has sharply criticized the current government. France said it has taken proportionate measures regarding Belarusian diplomats in France. Belarusian Ambassador to France Igor Fisenko was recalled to Minsk for consultations, the Belarusian Foreign Ministry said. Lukashenko on Monday revived accusations that the West is trying to overthrow him and meddle in Belarus’ internal affairs. In his parting message to Belarusians, de Lacoste described his time in the country as “difficult but unforgettable,” and said France “will remain at your side.” Belarusian opposition figure and former diplomat Pavel Latushko urged de Lacoste to join other Lukashenko critics in neighboring Lithuania, where the U.S. ambassador to Belarus is currently based. ___ Yuras Karmanau in Kyiv, Ukraine contributed.",western,1,460,97.48,55.61,28.56,9.7,23,39.57,78.26,52.61,40.43,3.91,2.39,0,0,0.22,1.96,0,1.52,11.3,8.04,1.09,17.17,4.35,1.3,5.22,1.09,11.52,5,1.09,7.17,0.65,0.87,5.87,8.04,0.22,7.61,2.17,1.3,0.65,0.65,0,3.04,0.22,4.57,1.74,2.83,0.43,0.22,0.22,0,0.22,0,0,15.43,8.26,0.22,0.43,1.96,0.65,3.91,6.52,0,0,0,1.96,9.57,6.3,3.26,0,2.83,0,0.22,2.61,0,0,0.22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.22,0.43,0.22,0,0.22,0,0,0.22,0,1.74,9.35,0,1.3,7.61,0.22,0,0.22,3.48,6.96,1.96,0.43,0,0,0,0,0,15,4.78,4.13,0,0,1.3,4.78

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid LONDON, Nov 17 (Reuters) - You almost have to re-read the small print for a reminder that stocks may ever fall again. The oft-used compliance disclaimer that the value of your investments may go down as well as up seems to be largely ignored by stock investors this days. And after a three-year winning streak, fund managers are clearly betting on another. Bank of America's penultimate monthly fund manager survey of 2021 shows the biggest overweight U.S. equities in eight years - with as few as 8% of the 388 respondents, managing more than $1 trillion in assets, claiming to be underweight stocks at large. And a weekly JPMorgan client survey had 60% planning to add even more equity exposure over the coming days and weeks. As 2022 investment outlooks from banks and funds stream in, the basic arguments for sticking with stocks are pretty simple. If a global pandemic and the sharpest economic contraction in a generation didn't spark a negative year for expensive equity indices - many wonder just what will right now. Keep riding the liquidity swell until it's finally drained still seems to be the consensus. Central banks may already be cutting emergency supports with inflation back on the radar - but the last place you want to be is in bonds unless you think we're heading back into a slump within 12 months. Few do. It's also hard to argue with the fact that stocks don't often go down over a full calendar year anyhow. The S&P500 has only ended in the red about one in four years since 1960. For a more diversified spread of equity risk, such as MSCI's all-country stock index, it's been the best rolling three-year period since the dot.com bubble 20 years ago and there have been only 4 down years since then. The index has precisely doubled from the deep but brief pandemic trough of March 2020. Aside from the famous boom and bust at the turn of the millennium, no three-year period has been better for stocks in the 34-year history of that global index. Given those metrics, the overwhelming consensus and the apparent lack of alternatives, you're inclined to sit up and take notice when what was one of the most bullish houses on Wall St forecasts a drop in stocks in 2022. Just this week Morgan Stanley - one of the most vocal and accurate Wall St forecasters of a V-shaped market recovery after the pandemic hit last year - said it sees the S&P500 some 6% below current levels by the end of next year. That's hardly a signal to run for the hills - but any negative sign on stock market forecasts is noteworthy these days and only the banking collapse of 2008 generated a more negative year for the S&P500 since the dot.com crash. REMOVING STABILIZERS Morgan Stanley's reasoning was far from alarmist, preferring to stress a 'normalizing' of growth and asset prices. It talked of the ""training wheels"" coming off the post-COVID recovery next year as policy supports are gradually removed and financial assets to have to balance on their own for a change. ""Markets are facing many 'normal' mid-cycle problems: better growth colliding with higher inflation, shifting policy and more expensive valuations."" Keeping its call in the context of nerves about tighter credit and financial conditions, it sees 10-year Treasury yields ending 2022 back at 2.10% from 1.6% today - basically only back to where it was in the middle of 2019. Yet even these relatively anodyne forecasts are outliers. Goldman Sachs expects another 9% on the S&P500 through next year, JPMorgan sees the index adding another 6% through the middle of next year at least and UBS sees it 6% higher by the end of 2022. Of course some of this is just about timing - just when does the wind change on policy mixed with still largely unknowable macro variables around inflation and even the pandemic itself. Unigestion portfolio manager Olivier Marciot said he's cautious about the year ahead but retains exposure to risk assets while watching central bank policy unfold. ""History has demonstrated that trying to anticipate the actual change in financial conditions from an accommodative to a tightening situation usually yields disappointing results."" What's more, forecasts already on the table are from where we stand in November. And a lot can happen in illiquid year-end markets when investors may be itching to bank profits. Already the dollar is rising sharply on a mix of inflation and interest rate concerns but also jarring geopolitics between western allies and Russia and China - from the Belarus border to Ukraine and Taiwan and even in space. And a rising dollar effectively tightens world financial conditions on its own. Military flashpoints or related energy price shocks and power blackouts in Europe and elsewhere could make for an even nervier year-end than usual. Come New Year's Eve, maybe even Morgan Stanley's 2022 call will start to look bullish. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

James Cleverly told MPs it would ""broaden the range"" of Russian people and businesses the UK could target. Currently, the government can only impose sanctions on those directly linked to Russian actions in Ukraine. Labour expressed concern that MPs would not have the chance to debate the law before the parliamentary recess. The House of Commons is closing on Thursday afternoon and will not reopen until 21 February. The party's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said MPs ""deserved an opportunity to scrutinise the sanctions"". And his Labour colleague Chris Bryant said: ""It's completely autocratic for government to publish legislation without any opportunity for anybody to scrutinise it, and frankly they have just been lazy. We're Johnny-come-latelies when it comes to sanctions in this area."" SNP MP Owen Thompson said his party wanted to be ""constructive"" but added: ""Without seeing the legislation it is very, very difficult to be fulsome in the support that we might otherwise have wanted to be."" Mr Cleverly said he understood their ""frustration"" but promised the government was ""moving at a pace"" to ensure the expanded sanctions regime would be in place to ""deter Russian aggression"". ""This legislation will significantly broaden the range of people, businesses and other entities that we can sanction in response to any further Russian aggression,"" he said. Last month, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss announced the government's intention to expand the powers and said the legislation would be in place by 10 February. She said the law would not impose sanctions automatically but would provide additional powers ""in the event of any further Russian incursion into Ukraine"". Russia has called the threat of further sanctions ""an undisguised attack on business"" and warned it could take retaliatory measures. Mr Cleverly's announcement comes as Russia and Belarus start 10 days of joint military drills close to the Belarusian border with Ukraine. Russia has denied it has plans to invade Ukraine and Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has accused the West of ""hysteria"". However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that the situation was at its ""most dangerous moment"".

US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the mobilisation was the biggest Europe had seen in decades. Her Russian counterpart accused the US of fomenting hysteria and unacceptable interference in Russia's affairs. The US and UK have promised further sanctions if Russia invades Ukraine. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said legislation was being prepared which would target a wider range of individuals and businesses close to the Kremlin than is currently possible. A US official said Washington's sanctions meant individuals close to the Kremlin would be cut off from the international financial system. Russia has placed an estimated 100,000 troops, tanks, artillery and missiles near Ukraine's frontiers. Diplomatic efforts continue, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken due to hold talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov later on Tuesday. The US said it had received a written response from Russia to a US proposal aimed at de-escalating the crisis in Ukraine. But hours later Russia's deputy foreign minister said that was not true and a source told Ria news agency it was still preparing a response. A state department spokesperson said the US remained fully committed to dialogue and would continue to consult closely with its allies and partners, including Ukraine. Meanwhile a number of European leaders are travelling to Ukraine on Tuesday for talks. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is flying to Kyiv after promising to work with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to find a diplomatic solution to arguments with Moscow and ""avoid further bloodshed"". Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte are also heading to the Ukrainian capital. At Monday's UN Security Council meeting, Russian Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya said there was no proof that Russia was planning military action against Ukraine, and that its troop build-up was not confirmed by the UN. He said Russia often deployed troops on its own territory and that this was none of Washington's business. Russia had tried to block the open session of the UN body but was outvoted by 10 votes to two. The Biden administration was ""whipping up tensions and rhetoric, and provoking escalation"", Mr Nebenzya said. ""This isn't just unacceptable interference in the internal affairs of our state, it's also an attempt to mislead the international community about the true situation in the region and the reasons for the current global tensions,"" he said. Ms Thomas-Greenfield said the US continued to believe there was a diplomatic solution but warned that the US would act decisively if Russia invaded Ukraine, the consequences of which would be ""horrific"". ""This is the largest... mobilisation of troops in Europe in decades,"" she said. ""And as we speak, Russia is sending even more forces and arms to join them."" Moscow was planning to increase its force deployed in neighbouring Belarus, on Ukraine's northern border, to 30,000, she added. Late on Monday, the US ordered the departure of family members of American government employees from Belarus, citing the ""unusual and concerning Russian military build-up"". A similar order was earlier issued to families of US government personnel in the American embassy in Ukraine's capital Kyiv. Moscow wants the West to promise Ukraine will never join the Nato alliance - in which members promise to come to another's aid in the event of an armed attack - but the US has rejected that demand. Nato's 30 members include the US and UK, as well as Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia - former Soviet republics which border Russia. Moscow sees Nato troops in eastern Europe as a direct threat to its security. Mr Putin has long argued the US broke a guarantee it made in 1990 that Nato would not expand further east, though interpretations differ over exactly what was promised.

Amid a buildup of an estimated 100,000 Russian troops near the border with Ukraine and massive joint war games with Belarus, the Defense Ministry said it will also conduct maneuvers involving the bulk of Russia’s naval potential. “The drills are intended to practice navy and air force action to protect Russian national interests in the world’s oceans and to counter military threats to the Russian Federation,” the ministry said, adding that they will start this month and run through February. It said the exercise will involve over 140 warships and more than 60 aircraft, and will be conducted in both littoral waters and more distant “operationally important” areas including the Mediterranean, northeastern Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean. The ministry said several Russian warships are currently taking part in a joint exercise with China and Iran in the Gulf of Oman that began Tuesday and will last until the weekend. U.S. President Joe Biden said  Wednesday he thinks Russia will invade Ukraine and warned President Vladimir Putin that his country would pay a “dear price” in lives lost and a possible cutoff from the global banking system if it does. Moscow has repeatedly denied having plans to launch an offensive. But it has sought a set of security guarantees from the West that would exclude NATO’s expansion to Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations and the deployment of alliance weapons there. Washington and its allies firmly rejected Moscow’s demands in security talks last week but kept the door open to possible further talks on arms control and confidence-building measures to reduce the potential for hostilities. Amid the tensions, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Ukraine Wednesday to reassure it of Western support and met with his British, French and German counterparts in Berlin on Thursday to discuss Ukraine  and other security matters. Blinken is set to meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Geneva on Friday. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova alleged that Ukrainian and Western claims of an imminent Russian attack on Ukraine were a “cover for staging large-scale provocations of their own, including those of military character.” “They may have extremely tragic consequences for the regional and global security,” Zakharova said. She pointed to the delivery of weapons to Ukraine by British military transport planes in recent days, claiming that Ukraine perceives Western military assistance as a “carte blanche for a military operation in Donbas.” Donbas, located in eastern Ukraine, is under control of Russia-backed separatists who have fought Ukrainian forces for nearly eight years, a conflict that has killed more than 14,000 people. Ukraine said earlier this week that it has taken the delivery of anti-tank missiles from the U.K. It has rejected Moscow’s claims that it plans an offensive to reclaim control of separatist-held areas in the country’s eastern industrial heartland. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the U.S. threat to cut off Russia from the global banking system could encourage hawkish forces in Ukraine to use force to reclaim control of the rebel east. “It may implant false hopes in the hotheads of some representatives of the Ukrainian leadership who may decide to quietly restart a civil war in their country,” Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. In a move that further beefs up forces near Ukraine, Russia has sent an unspecified number of troops from its far east to its ally Belarus, which shares a border with Ukraine, for major war games that run through Feb. 20. Ukrainian officials have said Moscow could use Belarusian territory to launch a potential multi-pronged invasion. The head of the European Union’s executive arm, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen reiterated Thursday that the EU “will respond with massive economic and financial sanctions” if Russia invades Ukraine. “We hope an attack won’t happen, but if it does, we are prepared,” von der Leyen said during an online speech to the Davos business forum. ___ Vanessa Gera in Warsaw, Poland, and Lorne Cook in Brussels, contributed to this report.",western,1,701,95.1,52.83,34.86,7.43,28.04,32.24,79.32,54.49,41.51,6.28,1.85,0,0.29,0.14,0.57,0.57,4.42,12.98,8.13,0.86,14.98,5.28,1.14,4.99,0.14,10.84,5.99,3.71,7.85,1.43,0.57,5.85,8.56,0,8.27,1,2,0.86,2.28,0.29,2.28,0,4.28,1.43,2.85,1.14,0.29,0.86,0,0.71,0.14,0,11.41,7.42,1,0,2.28,0.43,2.85,4.14,0,0.14,0.29,0.57,6.28,3.71,2.43,0.14,3.42,0.43,0.29,2.14,1,0,0.86,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.14,0.14,0,0.29,0.86,0,0,0,0,1.28,0.14,1.57,11.27,0.43,1.14,9.27,0,0.14,0.14,3.71,3.71,3.14,3,0.29,0.29,0.14,0,0,14.12,4.56,3.85,0,0,1.14,4.56

Cyber fuzzy rules of engagement,English,United States,"BOSTON (AP) — President Joe Biden couldn’t have been more blunt about the risks of cyberattacks spinning out of control. “If we end up in a war, a real shooting war with a major power,  it’s going to be as a consequence of a cyber breach of great consequence,”  he told his intelligence brain trust in July. Now tensions are soaring over Ukraine with Western officials warning about the danger of Russia launching damaging cyberattacks against Ukraine’s NATO allies. While no one is suggesting that could lead to a full-blown war between nuclear-armed rivals, the risk of escalation is serious. The danger is in the uncertainty about what crosses a digital red line. Cyberattacks, including those that cripple critical infrastructure with ransomware, have been on the rise for years and often go unpunished. It’s unclear how grave a malicious cyber operation by a state actor would have to be to cross the threshold to an act of war. “The rules are fuzzy,” said Max Smeets, director of the European Cyber Conflict Research Initiative. “It’s not clear what is allowed, what isn’t allowed.” The United States and other NATO members have threatened crippling sanctions against Russia if it sends troops into Ukraine. Less clear is whether such sanctions, whose secondary effects could also hurt Europe, would be imposed if Russia were to seriously damage Ukrainian critical infrastructure — power, telecommunications, finance, railways — with cyberattacks in lieu of invading. And if the West were to respond harshly to Russian aggression, Moscow could retaliate against NATO nations in cyberspace with an intensity and on a scale previously unseen. A major cyberattack on U.S. targets would almost certainly unleash a muscular response. But what of lesser cyberattacks? Or if Russian President Vladimir Putin restricted them to a NATO member in Europe? Under Article 5 of the organization’s treaty, an attack on any of its 30 members is considered an attack on all. But unclear is what it would take to unleash full-scale cyber retaliation. Or how bad an attack would have to be to trigger retaliation from NATO’s most potent cyber military forces, led by the U.S. and Britain. Cyberspace is exceptionally unruly. No arms control treaties exist to put guard rails on state-backed hacking, which is often shielded by plausible deniability as it’s often difficult to quickly attribute cyberattacks and intelligence-gathering intrusions. The technology is cheap and criminals can act as proxies, further muddying attribution. Freelancers and hacktivists compound the problem. In 2015, the major powers and others agreed on a set of 11 voluntary norms of international cyber behavior at the United Nations. But they are routinely ignored. Russia helped craft them only to knock Ukraine’s power grid offline that winter and set in motion its hack-and-leak operation to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Hacking is now a core component of great power conflict. In 2016, NATO formally designated cyberspace a “domain” of conflict, alongside land, sea and air. Nowhere has the militarization of cyberspace been more clear than in Putin’s bid to return Ukraine to Moscow’s orbit. To Serhii Demediuk, the No. 2 official on Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, a noisy cyberattack last month was “part of a full-scale Russian operation directed at destabilizing the situation in Ukraine, aimed at exploding our Euro-Atlantic integration and seizing power.” The attack damaged servers at the State Emergency Service and at the Motor Transport Insurance Bureau with a malicious “wiper” cloaked as ransomware. The damage proved minimal, but a message posted simultaneously on dozens of defaced government websites said: “Be afraid and expect the worst.” Such attacks are apt to continue as Putin tries to “degrade” and “delegitimize” trust in Ukrainian institutions, the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike  said in a blog  on Russian military cyber wreckage in the former Soviet republic: Winter attacks on the power grid in 2015 and 2016 were followed by NotPetya, which exacted more than $10 billion in damage globally. Michele Markoff, the U.S. State Department’s deputy coordinator for cyber issues, thinks “muscular diplomacy” is the only way  to end such “immoral, unethical and destabilizing behavior.” But how? Unlike nuclear arms, cyberweapons can’t easily be quantified, verified and limited in treaties. Nor are violators apt to be held accountable in the United Nations, not with Russia and China wielding veto power on its Security Council. “We’ve wallowed kind of in a quagmire for years now on making transgressors accountable,” said Duncan Hollis, a Temple Law professor and former State Department legal adviser. Members endorsed in May an update to the 2015 U.N. norm s that further delineates  what should be out of bounds: including hospitals, energy, water and sanitation, education and financial services. That has hardly deterred Russian-speaking ransomware crooks,  who are at the very least tolerated by the Kremlin. Nor have U.S. indictments of Russian and Chinese state hackers and the blacklisting of tech companies accused of aiding them  helped much. Under a new policy NATO adopted last year after U.S lobbying, an accumulation of lower-level cyberattacks — far below, say, blacking out the U.S. East Coast — could be enough to trigger Article 5. But NATO is vague on what a tipping point might be. NATO’s doctrinal shift followed a pair of seismic cyberespionage shocks — the highly targeted 2020 SolarWinds supply chain hack by Russia that badly rattled Washington and the reckless March 2021 Microsoft Exchange hack attributed to Chinese state security that set off a criminal hacking free-for-all. A cluster of wholesale data pilfering in the mid-2010s attributed to China — from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, United Airlines, Marriott hotels and the health insurer Anthem — inflicted a deep national security wound. And U.S. officials have worried for more than a decade about rivals — Russia especially — quietly “pre-positioning” enough malware  in U.S. critical infrastructure including the energy sector  to cause considerable chaos in an armed conflict. In response, U.S. Cyber Command  developed a strategy in 2018 it calls “persistent engagement”  to counter rivals who “operate continuously below the threshold of armed conflict to weaken institutions and gain strategic advantages.” The aim: deny foes the chance to breach U.S. systems by operating “across the interconnected battlespace, globally, as close as possible to adversaries,” Cybercom commander Gen. Paul Nakasone wrote. That has sometimes meant penetrating not just adversaries’ networks but also those of allies — without asking permission, said Smeets, the European cyber conflict analyst. Disinformation campaigns have also muddied the definition of a “cyber threat.” No longer do they merely encompass malware like NotPetya or the the Stuxnet virus that wrecked Iranian nuclear centrifuges, an operation widely attributed to the U.S. and Israel and discovered in 2010. During the 2018 U.S. midterm elections, Cybercom temporarily knocked offline a key Russian disinformation mill. Most major powers have the equivalent of a U.S. Cyber Command for both offense and defense. Also active are terrorists, criminals working as state proxies, begrudged freelancers and hacktivists like the Cyber Partisans of Belarus. Hollis compares the current messy cyber moment to the early 19th century when U.S. and European navies were so small they often relied on privateers — we know them now as pirates— for high-seas dirty work. The U.S. and other NATO partners are, meantime, helping Ukraine stand up a separate cyber military unit, said Demediuk, the Ukrainian security official. Since Russia seized Crimea in 2014, NATO has closely and systematically coordinating cyber actions with Ukraine, including joint missions, he said. In November, Ukraine exposed an eight-year espionage operation by agents of Russia’s FSB in Crimea involving more than 5,000 attempted hacks. The main goal: to gain control over critical infrastructure, including power plants, heating and water supply systems,  Ukraine’s state news agency said. This month, Microsoft said the operation, dubbed Armageddon, persists with attempts to penetrate Ukraine’s military, judiciary and law enforcement. Microsoft detected no damage, but that doesn’t mean Russian cyber operators haven’t gained undetected footholds. That’s where hackers hide until they are ready to pounce. ___ Associated Press writer Yuras Karmanau in Kyiv, Ukraine, contributed to this report.",western,1,1327,92.47,33.65,17.81,1.61,20.42,32.71,78.67,52,41.9,4.3,1.51,0,0.3,0.15,0.23,0.6,2.79,11.68,7.99,1.81,14.85,5.88,3.01,6.03,1.21,9.65,6.63,2.56,8.36,1.36,1.28,5.88,10.63,0.75,9.65,1.06,2.19,0.98,1.96,0.38,3.54,0,5.05,0.98,4.07,0.68,0,0.68,0.15,0.23,0,0,9.04,5.88,0.68,0,2.11,0.6,1.51,3.17,0,0,0,0.23,8.89,4.3,1.36,3.24,3.32,0.08,0,2.86,0.3,0.08,0.9,0.38,0.23,0,0,0,0,0,0.08,0.68,0,0.38,0,0.15,0,0.45,1.28,0.15,2.26,7.16,0.23,0.98,5.43,0.23,0.23,0.23,3.24,2.94,3.24,0.83,0.15,0.15,0,0,0,19.59,7.23,5.65,0.23,0,1.81,4.67

An activist group that is helping athlete Krystsina Tsimanouskaya told The Associated Press that it bought her a plane ticket to Warsaw for the coming days. The current standoff apparently began after Tsimanouskaya criticized how officials were managing her team — setting off a massive backlash in state-run media back home, where authorities relentlessly crack down on government critics. The runner said on her Instagram account that she was put in the 4x400 relay even though she has never raced in the event. The runner was then apparently hustled to the airport but refused to board a flight for Istanbul and instead approached police for help. In a filmed message distributed on social media, she also asked the International Olympic Committee for assistance. “I was put under pressure, and they are trying to forcibly take me out of the country without my consent,” the 24-year-old said in the message. The rapid-fire series of events brought international political intrigue to an Olympics that have been more focused on operational dramas, like maintaining safety during a pandemic and navigating widespread Japanese opposition to holding the event at all. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said: “What is important is that everyone who asks for protection, for refugee status, is afforded that opportunity. … The Japanese authorities have done what they can to protect her, and I think that is the most important part. No one should be forced to go home under threat or under force. “ Belarus’ authoritarian government has relentlessly targeted anyone even mildly expressing dissent since a presidential election a year ago triggered a wave of unprecedented mass protests. And it has also gone to extremes to stop its critics, including the recent plane diversion that European officials called an act of air piracy. In this context, Tsimanouskaya feared for her safety once she saw the campaign against her in state media, according to the Belarusian Sport Solidarity Foundation, the activist group that is helping her. “The campaign was quite serious and that was a clear signal that her life would be in danger in Belarus,” Alexander Opeikin, a spokesman for the foundation, told the AP in an interview. State media have continued to come down hard on Tsimanouskaya. Presenters on state TV channel Belarus 1 called her decision to seek asylum “a cheap stunt” and “a disgusting act,” and described her performance at the Olympics as a “failure.” Tsimanouskaya competed for Belarus on the first day of track events Friday at the National Stadium in Tokyo. She placed fourth in her first-round heat in the 100 meters, timing 11.47 seconds, and did not advance. She was due to compete again in the Olympic 200-meter heats on Monday, but she said her team barred her from participating in a complaint filed with the Court of Arbitration for Sport. She asked the court to overturn that decision, but the body declined to intervene. Tsimanouskaya’s next steps were not clear. Szymon Szynkowski vel Sek, a Polish deputy foreign minister, said the runner asked for the humanitarian visa for now and can still seek refugee status once in Poland. Vadim Krivosheyev, of the activist sports foundation, said she planned to seek asylum. Another Polish deputy foreign minister, Marcin Przydacz, told the Onet.pl news portal that once in Poland, Tsimanouskaya will be free to chose whether to stay there or to go to “another safe country.” Tsimanouskaya’s husband, Arseni Zdanevich, meanwhile, confirmed to the Russian Sport Express newspaper that he left Belarus for Ukraine. Athletes seeking asylum at global sporting events is nothing new — though Tsimanouskaya’s circumstances differ from the typical situation. Requests for asylum were especially frequent during the Cold War but they have also happened occasionally in the decades since. As many as 117 athletes defected at the Munich Olympics in 1972, according to reports at the time. At least four Romanians and a Soviet associated with the Olympics defected at the Montreal Games in 1976. And Cuban athletes have frequently done so. Underscoring the seriousness of the allegations, several groups and countries say they are helping the runner. Poland and the Czech Republic offered assistance, and Japan’s Foreign Ministry said it was working with the International Olympic Committee and the Tokyo Olympics organizers. The IOC, which has been in dispute with the Belarus National Olympic Committee ahead of the Tokyo Games, said it had intervened. “The IOC … is looking into the situation and has asked the NOC for clarification,” it said in a statement. A spokeswoman for the Belarus Olympic team did not respond to a request for comment. Many critics of Belarus’ government have fled to Poland. A top Belarusian dissident in the country, Pavel Latushka, said Tsimanouskaya and those supporting her had sought assistance from various European governments, but Poland was the quickest to respond. Przydacz said on Twitter that in addition to granting the humanitarian visa, Poland would also help the runner to continue her sports career. “Poland always stands for Solidarity,” he said. Several hours after she entered the Polish embassy, Tsimanouskaya was still believed to be inside. Czech Foreign Minister Jakub Kulhanek also tweeted that the Czech Republic has offered her asylum. The Belarus National Olympic Committee has been led for more than 25 years by authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko and his son, Viktor. Both Lukashenkos are banned from the Tokyo Olympics by the IOC, which investigated complaints from athletes that they faced reprisals and intimidation during the crackdown following the wave of anti-government protests over the last year. “Lukashenko perceives all criticism as part of a plot by Western countries,” said Valery Karbalevich, an independent Belarusian political analyst. “Tsimanouskaya’s protest is viewed as part of a broader movement of hundreds of Belarusian athletes who stood against the beatings of peaceful demonstrators and for a year have been taking part in street rallies.” The standoff over Tsimanouskaya comes just months after the dramatic diversion of a passenger plane flying between two EU countries. Belarusian authorities ordered the plane to land in Minsk — and pulled journalist and activist Raman Pratasevich and his Russian girlfriend off the flight. The elder Lukashenko maintained that there was a bomb threat against the plane and that’s why a fighter jet was scrambled to force it to land, but the move was roundly criticized by Western leaders. Pratasevich, who ran a channel on a messaging app used to organize demonstrations against Lukashenko’s rule, left his homeland in 2019. He has been charged with fomenting mass unrest and is under house arrest while he awaits trial. ___ Associated Press journalists Daria Litvinova and Daniel Kozin in Moscow, Monika Scislowska in Warsaw, Yuras Karmanau in Kyiv, Ukraine, and James Ellingworth in Tokyo contributed to this report. ___ More AP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2020-tokyo-olympics and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",western,1,1171,92.81,58.37,17.94,17.27,21.69,30.15,78.39,57.05,46.37,7.69,4.36,0.34,0,0.09,3.16,0.43,3.33,15.8,9.74,1.71,15.03,5.64,3.07,5.12,0.51,11.27,4.01,3.25,5.04,0.94,0.68,3.25,6.75,0.68,5.98,0.94,1.11,0.51,0.68,0,2.73,0,3.67,1.71,1.96,0.34,0,0.34,0.17,0,0,0,13.24,6.92,1.45,0.17,1.45,0.26,4.01,6.58,0.17,0.09,2.73,0.94,4.01,2.13,1.37,0.51,5.64,2.65,0.34,2.31,0.26,0.17,0.17,0.09,0.09,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.26,0,0,0,0.09,0.85,0.09,2.56,9.74,0.6,2.22,6.58,0.34,0,0.34,3.93,6.66,2.39,0.26,0.34,0.34,0,0,0,14.6,5.12,4.61,0,0,0.85,4.01
142,bbc.co.uk,2022-01-25 08:00:00,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60120217,"Ukraine : How will we know if war has started ? ",English,United Kingdom,"Everyone is trying to second-guess President Vladimir Putin's intentions in Ukraine. The US is pulling embassy staff out as fears rise of looming conflict. But maybe it's already started, writes security and defence expert Jonathan Marcus. The risk of an all-out war between Russia and Ukraine dominates the headlines. All the obvious questions are being asked. Will Russia attack? Is President Vladimir Putin determined upon war come what may? Or can diplomacy secure peace? But we cannot see inside President Putin's mind. So here's another question - how will we know when hostilities commence? The answer seems obvious. Clearly massed Russian tank formations crossing Ukraine's frontiers, or a massive rocket barrage or air strikes against Ukrainian positions, would mark a dramatic escalation in the crisis and a shift to a new phase of the conflict. The first alarms will come from the Ukrainian military itself, but Western satellites and intelligence-gathering aircraft may well spot the preparations for an imminent offensive. There will probably be clear signs of an impending onslaught, says Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military at the US-based Center for Naval Analyses. Among them are ""the manning of formations"", he says, since a lot of what has been deployed is heavy equipment rather than the troops themselves. Other signs could be ""the dispersal of forces, an influx of logistical and support elements, and a shift in fixed-wing and rotary aviation"". Watch: Ros Atkins On... Ukraine tensions But the question can also be answered in another way and for this we need to stand back and view the Russian campaign against Ukraine in its entirety. We need to look at the full toolkit available to Moscow and assess how it is being used. And in this light, when you ask -  how will we know if the conflict has started  - then the answer may be that it already has. Hostilities have actually been under way for some years. Let's start from where we are. Russia already occupies Crimea - part of Ukraine - and it provides practical assistance to anti-Kyiv rebels in the Donbas region. Indeed it was the intervention of Russian armoured and mechanised units against Ukrainian forces in 2014 that prevented the pro-Russian rebels' defeat. Sporadic fighting has continued ever since. All sides supposedly support an international peace effort there, but little progress has been made. Beyond this pressure there is also the threat to employ overwhelming military force. The build-up of Russian combat formations around Ukraine's borders is extraordinary.  This includes a significant deployment of forces to Belarus - which also shares a border with Ukraine - which might provide a closer jumping-off point for an assault towards the Ukrainian capital Kyiv itself. This build-up is referred to by Russian spokesmen as an exercise and in no sense threatening. But its scale, the nature of the units deployed, and the gradual arrival of supplies and other ""enablers"" suggest that this is much more than routine manoeuvres. Analysts have followed the build-up using civilian satellite photos. Numerous phone videos have been put online showing trains of equipment heading towards Ukraine or Belarus. And assessments of social media postings, correlated with the units seen to be on the move, provide a remarkable insight into what is going on. Irrespective of what Moscow may say, Ukraine and its friends in the West have every reason to be worried. The next tool available to Moscow is an attempt to influence the narrative. On the one hand Russia says it is not preparing for war, though it very much looks as though it is. But, just as importantly,  it has a story to tell - a narrative - where far from Ukraine being the victim, it is in fact Russia itself that is threatened. This is the substance of the documents handed over to the US which seek to halt and in some ways reverse Nato expansion and create a new sphere of influence for Moscow. While some aspects of Russia's concerns, like talks on strategic and other weapons systems, are widely seen as a good idea, on Nato enlargement it is unlikely to get any change - and it probably knows this. But the narrative has another purpose too. It is the story that Russia tells to try to shape the way the whole Ukraine crisis is discussed, not just by Western governments or its own citizens, but by you and me, reading and writing this. By all fair and rigorous independent analysis Russia is preparing for war with Ukraine, whatever its official spokesmen may say. There are other possibilities in the Russian toolbox too. Cyber-attack and subversion, for example. Ukraine certainly has been the subject of the former. Just over a week ago a number of government websites were hit though it was far from clear where the attack came from. More recently the UK Government has claimed evidence that Moscow has selected individuals to form a new government in Kyiv - though whatever the suspicions, there has been no conclusive public evidence confirming Moscow's hand in such activities. Michael Kofman says that a cyber element could be an important part of any Russian attack, because they can cripple critical infrastructure and disrupt Ukraine's ability to coordinate a military effort. When Russia seized Crimea we heard a lot of talk about ""hybrid"" and ""grey-zone warfare"" and the alleged deniability of the operation, whose participants, though uniformed, wore no military insignia. But there was no doubt who these troops were. And Crimea was seized with old-fashioned military force, rather than by some esoteric deception. What is under way at present is the essence of ""grey-zone warfare"" - the blurring of the boundary between peace and war. That's not how we tend to view things in the West. But the Russian military has articulated a sophisticated doctrine that sees war and peace as a continuum where different tools are applied at different stages, sometimes in sequence, sometimes together, though with the same strategic aim. And that ultimately is why the conflict has already been joined. The only question is how far along the ""grey zone"" continuum President Putin is willing to go.

In a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg as the annual Munich Security Conference got underway, Harris thanked the alliance for “all that you have done” throughout the crisis. “We remain, of course, open to and desirous of diplomacy, as it relates to the dialogue and the discussions we have had with Russia, but we are also committed, if Russia takes aggressive action, to ensure there will be severe consequence in terms of the sanctions we have discussed,” Harris told Stoltenberg. “And we know the alliance is strong in that regard.” Harris and her top national security aides huddled with Stoltenberg after President Joe Biden on Thursday in Washington warned that “every indication” suggests Russia is “prepared to go into Ukraine, attack Ukraine.” Russia probably has massed between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and near Ukraine, said Michael Carpenter, the permanent U.S. representative to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The 190,000 estimate announced Friday includes not only military troops along the border and in Belarus but also forces that were not included in the previous U.S. estimate of 150,000. It adds troops in Crimea, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014; Russian National Guard and other internal security units; and Russian-led forces in eastern Ukraine. Harris said it was “intentional” that she was holding her first meeting at the annual security conference with NATO’s secretary general. The administration is trying to drive the message to Putin that the crisis has only bolstered the 30-country military alliance’s resolve to push back against Moscow’s aggression. Stoltenberg echoed Harris’ sentiment of growing NATO unity during the crisis. “I also welcome the fact that European allies are stepping up, also increasing their presence in the eastern border of the alliance and also investing more in defense,” Stoltenberg said. “So the reality is that North America and Europe are doing more together now that we’ve done for many years.” U.S. and European officials are on high alert for any Russian attempts to create a pretext for invasion. Officials are concerned that increased shelling in the Donbas region, the slice of land where Russian-backed separatists have battled for years against the Ukrainian government, could be used by the Kremlin as a pretext to launch an invasion of Ukraine. Harris met with Latvian President Egils Levits, Lithuania President Gitanas Nauseda, and Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas to discuss the latest developments related to Russia’s buildup on Ukraine’s border and U.S. readiness to further reinforce NATO allies on the eastern flank of the alliance. Harris underscored to the Baltic leaders, who are watching the situation on the Ukraine-Russian border warily, that the Biden administration is committed to a central tenet of the NATO alliance: the principle of mutual defense. “Our position has always been and will continue to be that Article 5 is ironclad and the spirit behind it — an attack on one is an attack on all — remains our perspective,” said Harris, referring to the charter that spells out the mutual defense provision. “I do believe our greatest strength is our unity.” Nauseda urged the U.S., which has bolstered its troops presence in the Baltics in recent weeks, to do even more and create a “permanent presence” in Lithuania. Currently, the U.S. deploys a small contingent of troops to the country on a rotational basis. “I would say it is critically important for the security of our region to see more presence of United States troops,” Nauseda said. Kallas echoed the call for a greater U.S. presence in the Baltic countries. “We have lost our independence to Russia once, and we don’t want it to happen again,” she said. Harris is set to deliver a major address at the conference on Saturday that will focus on the Ukraine crisis. Preparations for the address were fluid, but Harris in part is expected to spotlight the unity of NATO and Western allies in the face of the Ukraine crisis, the administration official said. Meanwhile, Biden planned to speak by phone Friday with trans-Atlantic leaders about the Russian military buildup and continued efforts at deterrence and diplomacy. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was also in Munich on Friday where he was met with his counterparts from Britain, France and Germany. Blinken is also scheduled to meet one-on-one with Qatari Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani and French Foreign Minister Jean-Ives Le Drian. — Associated Press writer Lolita C.

REUTERS/Carlo Allegri NEW YORK, Oct 21 (Reuters) - A prosecutor on Thursday urged jurors in federal court to hold former Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas ""accountable"" for campaign finance violations, in a trial over allegedly illicit efforts to conceal donations. In his closing argument, Assistant U.S. Attorney Hagan Scotten said the government had demonstrated that Parnas used funds from Russian businessman Andrey Muraviev to contribute to U.S. candidates in various state and federal elections. Scotten said Parnas was trying to obtain licenses to operate cannabis companies. ""You saw the wires from Muraviev,"" Scotten told the jury. ""You saw how that money came out on the other side, finding its way into American elections, where the defendants thought they had bought influence to further their business."" A Muraviev associate, Andrey Kukushkin, is being tried alongside Parnas. Defense attorneys also made closing arguments in the trial's ninth day in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. In his closing statement, Parnas' attorney, Joseph Bondy, characterized his client as a passionate proponent of marijuana legalization who was ""in well over his head."" He argued that Muraviev's money funded business operations, not campaign contributions. Parnas and Kukushkin face two counts of conspiring to make donations from a foreign national, and making the donations. Parnas alone faces four other counts, including making false statements to the Federal Elections Commission (FEC). Parnas, a 49-year-old Florida resident, and Kukushkin, who lives in California, have both pleaded not guilty. Both men are Ukraine-born U.S. citizens. Prosecutors also accused Parnas of making two contributions through a shell company to conceal that his onetime business partner Igor Fruman was the true source of the funds, and of lying to the FEC about the funds. Bondy characterized Fruman's funding as a ""bona-fide capital investment"" in an energy company that Parnas and Fruman started together. ""There was no effort to make a contribution in the name of another, whatsoever,"" Bondy told jurors. Fruman, a Belarus-born U.S. citizen who lives in Florida, pleaded guilty in September to one count of soliciting campaign contributions from a foreign national. His sentencing is scheduled for Jan. 21. The trial has drawn attention because of the role Parnas and Fruman played in helping Giuliani - former President Donald Trump's former personal attorney - investigate Democrat Joe Biden during the 2020 presidential campaign. Biden won the November election, denying Trump a second term in the White House. Giuliani's attorney has said the Parnas case is separate from a probe into whether the former New York City mayor violated lobbying laws while representing Trump. Giuliani, a former New York mayor, has not been charged with any crimes and denies wrongdoing. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

Siarhei Satsuk, the chief editor of Yezhednevnik, or ej.by, online outlet, was detained after a raid of his apartment on bribery charges that he denied, his brother said. He faces 10 years in prison if convicted. The ej.by website, which has an audience of 10,000 readers, was blocked Wednesday. Satsuk is the 30th journalist, who is currently in custody in Belarus, either awaiting trial or serving a sentence. “Journalism has become one of the most dangerous professions in Belarus,” Andrei Bastunets, the head of the Belarusian Association of Journalists, told The Associated Press. “The situation with freedom of speech in Belarus is the worst in Europe, the authorities are depriving citizens of any alternative information.” Satsuk’s outlet has actively covered protests, which were ignited by the August 2020 presidential election that the opposition and the West rejected as rigged. Belarus’ authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko, who received a sixth term in the vote, responded by unleashing a sweeping crackdown on protesters that saw more than 35,000 people arrested and thousands beaten by police. Satsuk was briefly arrested in March 2020 on bribery charges linked to an annual rating of businesses published by his outlet, but he was released quickly and the criminal investigation against him was closed soon after. Earlier this month, his media outlet launched a new project about independent journalists and activists who were branded “extremists” and “terrorists” by Belarusian authorities. Satsuk’s arrest could be linked to that, or, it could be that “it’s simply his turn,” Satsuk’s brother Alexander told the AP. He said that the authorities confiscated his electronic equipment along with the opposition red-and-white flag.",western,1,305,92.35,55.7,11.41,1.83,23.46,33.77,77.38,54.75,46.23,8.52,4.92,0,0,0,3.93,0,3.61,17.05,10.16,2.95,14.1,6.56,1.97,4.92,0,9.84,5.57,2.95,7.87,0.98,0,6.89,7.54,0,7.21,0.66,0.33,0.66,1.64,0.33,4.26,0,4.26,0.66,3.61,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.8,4.59,0,0,1.64,0.33,2.62,6.89,0.66,0,0,4.59,4.59,2.62,1.31,0.66,5.9,0,1.31,3.93,0.98,0,0.66,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.33,0.33,0,0,0,0.33,0,0.98,6.23,0,1.31,4.59,0.33,0,0,5.25,6.23,2.95,0.33,0,0,0,0,0,19.34,4.92,8.2,0,0,1.64,4.59

Monastyrskiy said Ukraine planned new military exercises in the next two weeks to prepare in case migrants tried to cross the border illegally. Ukraine is wary of becoming a new flashpoint in the migrant crisis on Belarus's borders with the European Union, which Kyiv accuses Russia of instigating.

Parliament this week authorised Ukrainian border guards to use military equipment and firearms. Asked about this, Monastyrskiy said the guards should be ready to use them if necessary, but there was no need at the moment. Relations between Kyiv and Moscow collapsed after Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula and the outbreak of fighting between Ukrainian troops and pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.

Amid the soaring tensions, the White House warned that Russia could attack its neighbor at “any point,” while the U.K. delivered a batch of anti-tank weapons to Ukraine. Russia’s Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin said the joint drills with Belarus would involve practicing a joint response to external threats. Ukrainian officials have warned that Russia could launch an attack on Ukraine from several directions, including from its ally Belarus. The U.S. again stressed its concern Tuesday, with White House press secretary Jen Psaki describing the Russian forces’ move into Belarus as part of as “extremely dangerous situation.” “We’re now at a stage where Russia could at any point launch an attack in Ukraine,” she said. A series of talks last week between Russia, the U.S. and NATO failed to quell the tensions over Ukraine. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will meet his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Geneva on Friday in another attempt to defuse the crisis. Ukraine’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday it has received a shipment of anti-tank weapons from the U.K., noting that they will help “strengthen our defense capability.” Russia already has started moving troops for the war games in Belarus. Fomin said it would take through Feb. 9 to fully deploy weapons and personnel for the Allied Resolve 2022 drills, which are expected to take place Feb. 10-20. Fomin didn’t say how many troops will be involved, but mentioned that Russia will deploy a dozen Su-35 fighter jets and several air defense units to Belarus. The deployment would bolster an estimated 100,000 Russian troops with tanks and other heavy weapons who are already amassed near Ukraine. Russia has denied that it intends to attack its neighbor but demanded guarantees from the West that NATO will not expand to Ukraine or other former Soviet nations or place its troops and weapons there. Washington and its allies firmly rejected Moscow’s demands during Russia-U.S. negotiations in Geneva and a related NATO-Russia meeting in Brussels last week. Fomin said the drills in Belarus, which involve an unspecified number of troops from Russia’s Eastern Military District, reflect the need to practice concentrating the country’s entire military potential in the west. “A situation may arise when forces and means of the regional group of forces will be insufficient to ensure reliable security of the union state, and we must be ready to strengthen it,” Fomin said at a meeting with foreign military attaches. “We have reached an understanding with Belarus that it’s necessary to engage the entire military potential for joint defense.” Belarus’ authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said the joint maneuvers will be conducted on Belarus’ western border and in the country’s south, where it borders Ukraine. Lukashenko, who has edged increasingly close to Russia amid Western sanctions over his government’s crackdown on domestic protests, has recently offered to host Russian nuclear weapons. A senior Biden administration official said the Russian troop deployment to Belarus raises concerns that Moscow may be planning to stage troops there to stretch Ukraine’s defenses with an attack from the north. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive issues, noted that the movement may also indicate Belarus’ willingness “to allow both Russian conventional and nuclear forces to be stationed on its territory.” Amid the tensions, Ukraine’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday that it was speeding up efforts to form reserve battalions that would allow for the rapid deployment of 130,000 recruits to expand the country’s 246,000-strong military. The United States and its allies have urged Russia to deescalate the situation by calling back the troops amassed near Ukraine. “In recent weeks, more than 100,000 Russian troops with tanks and guns have gathered near Ukraine without an understandable reason, and it’s hard not to understand that as a threat,” German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told reporters Tuesday after talks in Moscow with her Russian counterpart, Lavrov. Lavrov responded by restating Moscow’s argument that it’s free to deploy its forces wherever it considers it necessary on its territory. “We can’t accept demands about our armed forces on our own territory,” Lavrov said. “We aren’t threatening anyone, but we are hearing threats to us.” Baerbock emphasized that the West was ready “for a serious dialogue on mutual agreements and steps to bring everyone in Europe more security.” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg met with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin on Tuesday. He said “the main task now is to make progress on the political way forward” to prevent a military attack against Ukraine. “NATO allies are ready to meet with Russia again, and today I have invited Russia and all the NATO allies to attend a series of meetings in the NATO-Russia Council in the near future to address our concerns but also listen to Russia’s concerns,” Stoltenberg said. He added that NATO “in the near future” will deliver its written proposals in response to Russian demands and “hopefully we can begin meeting after that.” “We need to see what Russia says, and that will be a kind of pivotal moment,” the NATO chief said. Lavrov, meanwhile, reaffirmed that Russia wants a quick Western answer to its demand for security guarantees that would preclude NATO’s expansion to Ukraine and limit its presence in Eastern Europe. He repeated that in a phone conversation with Blinken, who will visit Ukraine on Wednesday and meet with Lavrov on Friday. Speaking on a visit Tuesday to Ukraine, Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly denounced the Russian troop buildup as unacceptable. She noted Canada’s efforts to help train Ukraine’s military, adding that it’s currently considering Ukraine’s demand to provide it with military equipment and will make “a decision in a timely manner.” Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 after the ouster of Ukraine’s Moscow-friendly leader and also threw its weight behind a separatist insurgency that took over large sections in eastern Ukraine. More than 14,000 people have been killed in nearly eight years of fighting there. ___ Aamer Madhani and Ellen Knickmeyer in Washington, Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lorne Cook in Brussels, and Yuras Karmanau in Kyiv, Ukraine, contributed to this report.",western,1,1060,92.11,64.05,30.94,8.08,23.56,30.85,79.43,55.19,43.21,8.11,2.74,0.09,1.23,0.19,0.75,0.09,5.38,12.92,7.26,1.23,15.85,5.66,2.45,4.34,0.47,11.13,5.47,3.11,10.47,3.21,0.85,6.42,8.77,0.19,8.21,1.51,1.51,1.51,1.23,0.57,2.26,0,3.96,1.32,2.64,0.38,0.09,0.28,0.19,0.09,0,0,12.64,7.55,1.04,0,1.51,0.09,3.96,5.47,0,0.09,0.28,0.57,5.66,3.87,1.51,0.28,2.55,0.19,0.38,1.98,0,0,0.28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.19,0.09,0.47,0.19,0.94,0.09,0.09,0,0,1.13,0,2.74,10.94,0.47,1.23,8.3,0.38,0.19,0.57,4.25,3.68,2.83,2.74,0.38,0.38,0.19,0,0,17.17,5.19,4.53,0,0,2.83,4.62

But the Polish government hopes that worst-case scenario can be averted. Similar preparations are being made across the region, particularly in those nations which share borders with Ukraine. As other countries draw down their diplomatic missions in Ukraine, Poland says it is for now keeping its diplomatic operations in place in case they are needed to facilitate a large-scale exit of Ukrainians. Poland, which has welcomed large numbers of Ukrainian economic migrants in recent years, particularly after Russia’s incursions into Ukraine in 2014, has been making plans for weeks to accept refugees if it comes to that, said Marcin Przydacz, a deputy foreign minister. While Poland has an image of being staunchly anti-refugee, that opposition is largely based on not wanting to take in large numbers of people of different religious and racial backgrounds. Ukrainians — who like Poles are a Slavic people with a similar language and customs — have filled gaps in the labor market and have been largely welcomed in Poland in recent years. Przydacz said in a radio interview on Monday that Poland hopes the situation in Ukraine won’t escalate, but that the country was preparing for any possibility, including the possibility of large numbers of refugees. “In this worst-case scenario, we are not talking about hundreds or thousands, but much larger numbers,” Przydacz said on Radio Plus. He added that the Interior Ministry has been preparing “internal scenarios, infrastructure and plans” for many weeks. The plans would include housing refugees in hostels, dormitories, sports facilities and other venues. Local officials, including town mayors, have been asked to draw up reports of what facilities they could make available, according to Krzysztof Kosiński, the mayor of Ciechanow, a Polish town near the border with Ukraine, and the secretary of the Association of Polish Cities. Ukraine, which is bordered by Belarus to the north and Russia to the east, also shares borders with the EU nations of Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania, as well as the non-EU state of Moldova. Hungary’s nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orban, warned Saturday that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could send hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees fleeing across the border into his country. Meanwhile, Slovakia is also preparing for a wave of refugees in the case of a conflict. The government has prepared a plan what to do in such a scenario, but it is classified. “According to the existing studies and analysis, I can say that even a limited Russian military attack on Ukrainian territory would mean tens of thousands of refugees crossing our border,” Slovakian Defense Minister Jaroslav Nad said. Nad said those fleeing a war would receive refugee status. “From the European continent’s perspective, the current situation is the most dangerous since World War II,” Nad said. Czech Interior Minister Vit Rakusan has offered to send police officers to help Slovakia in the case of such a conflict. ___ Karel Janicek in Prague, and Justin Spike in Budapest, Hungary, contributed to this report.",western,1,520,94.4,44.61,37.37,22.63,24.76,32.12,81.15,58.08,46.54,6.15,1.73,0.19,0.38,0,0.38,0.58,4.42,13.85,7.88,1.15,17.31,7.12,2.12,4.81,0.58,12.88,4.62,5.38,4.62,1.35,0.77,2.5,9.23,0,9.23,1.35,1.15,2.12,1.73,0,3.27,0,3.65,1.92,1.73,0.38,0.38,0,0,0,0,0,10.38,5.19,0.58,0.77,0.96,0,2.31,4.42,0,0,0,0.38,6.92,4.62,2.31,0,2.5,0.19,0.19,1.54,0.38,0.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.19,0.58,0.77,0,0.19,0,0,0.96,0,2.88,11.54,0.19,0.96,10.38,0.19,0,0,2.69,3.27,4.81,2.5,0,0,0,0,0,16.15,4.04,7.88,0,0,0.77,3.46
776,apnews.com,2022-02-08 08:00:00,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-russia-diplomacy-emmanuel-macron-europe-9dd7eb560d26a81306604dcb1c81bddb,Macron on diplomatic shuttle to Kyiv to ease Ukraine crisis,English,United States,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron said Tuesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin told him that Moscow would not further escalate the Ukraine crisis. Macron also said it would take time to find a diplomatic solution to the rising tensions, which represent the biggest security crisis between Russia and the West since the Cold War. His remarks on a visit to Kyiv came as the Kremlin denied reports that he and Putin struck a deal on de-escalating the crisis. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that “in the current situation, Moscow and Paris can’t be reaching any deals.” Macron met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy amid mounting fears of a Russian invasion. Moscow has massed over 100,000 troops near Ukraine’s borders, but insists it has no plans to attack. The Kremlin wants guarantees from the West that NATO will not accept Ukraine and other former Soviet nations as members, that it halt weapon deployments there and roll back its forces from Eastern Europe — demands the U.S. and NATO reject as nonstarters. At a news conference after meeting Zelenskyy, Macron said Putin told him during their more than five-hour session Monday that “he won’t be initiating an escalation. I think it is important.” According to the French president, Putin also said there won’t be any Russian “permanent (military) base” or “deployment” in Belarus, where Russia had sent a large number of troops for war games. Peskov said withdrawing Russian troops from Belarus after the maneuvers was the plan all along. Zelenskyy said he would welcome concrete steps from Putin for de-escalation, adding he didn’t “trust words in general.” Macron also sought to temper expectations. “Let’s not be naive,” he said. “Since the beginning of the crisis, France hasn’t been inclined to exaggerate, but at the same time, I don’t believe this crisis can be settled in a few hours, through discussions” Zelenskyy called his talks with Macron “very fruitful.” “We have a common view with President Macron on threats and challenges to the security of Ukraine, of the whole of Europe, of the world in general,” Zelenskyy said. He said France was giving 1.2 billion euros ($1.3 billion) in financial aid to Ukraine and helping restore infrastructure in the war-ravaged east of the country. Western leaders in recent weeks have engaged in high-level talks, and more are planned against the backdrop of military drills in Russia and Belarus. On Tuesday, the Russian Defense Ministry said that six amphibious landing ships were moving from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea for exercises and two Tu-22M3 long-range nuclear capable bombers flew another patrol over Belarus. Macron said he had not expected Putin to make any “gestures” Monday, saying his objective was to “prevent an escalation and open new perspectives. ... That objective is met.” Macron said Putin “set a collective trap” by initiating the exchange of documents with the U.S. Moscow submitted its demands to Washington in the form of draft agreements that were made public, and insisted on a written response, which was then leaked. “In the history of diplomacy, there was never a crisis that has been settled by exchanges of letters which are to be made public afterward,” he said, adding that’s why he decided to go to Moscow for direct talks. Macron later flew to Berlin, where he briefed Polish President Andrzej Duda and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who said their stance was unified, with a joint goal “to prevent a war in Europe.” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was pleased to see the high level of diplomatic activity, spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. “The secretary‑general could not be clearer in the need to increase diplomatic activity to avoid any sort of escalation,” Dujarric said. Putin said after Monday’s meeting that the U.S. and NATO ignored Moscow’s demands, but signaled readiness to continue talking. He also reiterated a warning that NATO membership for Ukraine could trigger a war between Russia and the alliance should Kyiv try to retake the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow annexed in 2014. NATO, U.S. and European leaders reject the demands that they say challenge NATO’s core principles, like shutting the door to Ukraine or other countries that might seek membership; but they have offered to discuss other Russian security concerns in Europe. U.S. President Joe Biden has said any prospect of Ukraine entering NATO “in the near term is not very likely,” but he and other alliance members and NATO itself refuse to rule out Ukraine’s future entry. Biden met Monday with Scholz, who also will travel to Kyiv and Moscow on Feb. 14-15. They threatened Russia with grave consequences if it invaded, and Biden vowed that the Nord Stream 2 Russia-to-Germany gas pipeline, which has been completed but is not yet operating, will be blocked. Such a move would hurt Russia economically but also cause energy supply problems for Germany. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, in an article in the Times of London, also urged allies to finalize heavy economic sanctions that would take effect if Russia crosses into Ukraine. He said the U.K. is ready to bolster NATO forces in Latvia and Estonia as he prepared to meet the Lithuanian prime minister in London to show support for the Baltic nations. Johnson said he was considering dispatching RAF Typhoon fighters and Royal Navy warships to southeastern Europe. Britain said Monday it is sending 350 troops to Poland to bolster NATO’s eastern flank. It already has sent anti-tank weapons to Ukraine. More than 100 U.S. military personnel arrived in Romania ahead of a deployment of about 1,000 NATO troops expected in the country in the coming days, Romania’s Defense Minister Vasile Dincu said. U.S. officials have said that about 1,000 alliance troops will be sent from Germany to Romania, a NATO member since 2004. Romania borders Ukraine to the north. About 1,700 U.S. soldiers from the 82nd Airborne are also going to Poland. U.S. officials have portrayed the threat of an invasion of Ukraine as imminent — warnings Moscow has scoffed at, accusing Washington of fueling tensions. Russia and Ukraine have been locked in a bitter conflict since 2014, when Ukraine’s Kremlin-friendly president was ousted, Moscow annexed Crimea and then backed a separatist insurgency in the east of the country. The fighting between Russia-backed rebels and Ukrainian forces has killed over 14,000 people. In 2015, France and Germany helped broker a peace deal, known as the Minsk agreements, that ended large-scale hostilities but failed to bring a political settlement of the conflict. The Kremlin has repeatedly accused Kyiv of sabotaging the deal, and Ukrainian officials in recent weeks said that implementing it would hurt Ukraine. After meeting Macron, Putin said without elaboration that some of the French president’s proposals could serve as a basis for a settlement of the separatist conflict, adding that they agreed to speak by phone after Macron’s visit to Kyiv. Peskov said such a call would take place “in the nearest future.” Macron said both Putin and Zelenskyy confirmed they were willing to implement the Minsk agreements — “the only path allowing to build peace ... and find a sustainable political solution.” Macron also said the presidential advisers of France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine will meet Thursday in Berlin on the next steps. “It will take time to get results,” he said. Zelenskyy was mum on where Ukraine stands on implementing the Minsk agreements and whether he assured Macron that Kyiv is committed to do so, saying only that his country views Thursday’s meeting “very positively” and hoped for a subsequent meeting by the four leaders. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, visiting the front line in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, said she wanted “to get an impression of what it means that we still have war in the middle of Europe.” Germany has given Ukraine about 1.8 billion euros in aid since 2014, part of which is helping those displaced by fighting. ___ Litvinova reported from Moscow.

In a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg as the annual Munich Security Conference got underway, Harris thanked the alliance for “all that you have done” throughout the crisis. “We remain, of course, open to and desirous of diplomacy, as it relates to the dialogue and the discussions we have had with Russia, but we are also committed, if Russia takes aggressive action, to ensure there will be severe consequence in terms of the sanctions we have discussed,” Harris told Stoltenberg. “And we know the alliance is strong in that regard.” Harris and her top national security aides huddled with Stoltenberg after President Joe Biden on Thursday in Washington warned that “every indication” suggests Russia is “prepared to go into Ukraine, attack Ukraine.” Russia probably has massed between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and near Ukraine, said Michael Carpenter, the permanent U.S. representative to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The 190,000 estimate announced Friday includes not only military troops along the border and in Belarus but also forces that were not included in the previous U.S. estimate of 150,000. It adds troops in Crimea, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014; Russian National Guard and other internal security units; and Russian-led forces in eastern Ukraine. Harris said it was “intentional” that she was holding her first meeting at the annual security conference with NATO’s secretary general. The administration is trying to drive the message to Putin that the crisis has only bolstered the 30-country military alliance’s resolve to push back against Moscow’s aggression. Stoltenberg echoed Harris’ sentiment of growing NATO unity during the crisis. “I also welcome the fact that European allies are stepping up, also increasing their presence in the eastern border of the alliance and also investing more in defense,” Stoltenberg said. “So the reality is that North America and Europe are doing more together now that we’ve done for many years.” U.S. and European officials are on high alert for any Russian attempts to create a pretext for invasion. Officials are concerned that increased shelling in the Donbas region, the slice of land where Russian-backed separatists have battled for years against the Ukrainian government, could be used by the Kremlin as a pretext to launch an invasion of Ukraine. Harris met with Latvian President Egils Levits, Lithuania President Gitanas Nauseda, and Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas to discuss the latest developments related to Russia’s buildup on Ukraine’s border and U.S. readiness to further reinforce NATO allies on the eastern flank of the alliance. Harris underscored to the Baltic leaders, who are watching the situation on the Ukraine-Russian border warily, that the Biden administration is committed to a central tenet of the NATO alliance: the principle of mutual defense. “Our position has always been and will continue to be that Article 5 is ironclad and the spirit behind it — an attack on one is an attack on all — remains our perspective,” said Harris, referring to the charter that spells out the mutual defense provision. “I do believe our greatest strength is our unity.” Nauseda urged the U.S., which has bolstered its troops presence in the Baltics in recent weeks, to do even more and create a “permanent presence” in Lithuania. Currently, the U.S. deploys a small contingent of troops to the country on a rotational basis. “I would say it is critically important for the security of our region to see more presence of United States troops,” Nauseda said. Kallas echoed the call for a greater U.S. presence in the Baltic countries. “We have lost our independence to Russia once, and we don’t want it to happen again,” she said. Harris is set to deliver a major address at the conference on Saturday that will focus on the Ukraine crisis. Preparations for the address were fluid, but Harris in part is expected to spotlight the unity of NATO and Western allies in the face of the Ukraine crisis, the administration official said.

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan briefed Senate leadership Monday afternoon amid fast-moving developments. President Joe Biden and Western leaders are working swiftly to persuade Putin not to invade Ukraine, an attack the administration warns could unfold in a matter of days. Biden’s administration is able to impose devastating sanctions on Russia that would cut across the country’s economy, with or without congressional action, senators said. Senators emerged from the closed-door session suggesting all options remain on the table. Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee working to assemble the legislation, said, “Either we’re going to have a sanctions package ...” or “We should express the Senate’s position vis-à-vis the support of Ukraine, at a minimum.” The top Republican on the panel, Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho, said even a Senate resolution backing Ukraine would carry weight: “It sends a message.” Senators are racing time as Putin’s military has amassed at the Ukraine border and in neighboring Belarus as Washington works with Western allies to prevent what experts warn could become a wider war in Europe. The Senate is poised to recess at the end of the week, and lawmakers want a unified response before then. There is broad support in the Senate for imposing sanctions on Russia as a powerful foreign policy tool, but Republicans and Democrats differ on the details and timing. There have also been differences over the Nord Stream 2 energy pipeline between Russia and Germany, although those may have become resolved after Biden said last week the energy line would not continue if Russia invades  Ukraine. Senators considering the options Monday also said the White House has its own strategy, signaling they may hold off as the administration pursues its approach. They said the administration can impose sanctions on its own, regardless of congressional action. “We don’t want to complicate their lives by restricting their ability to engage in diplomacy with Europe,” said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. “I think the deeper we got into it, the more complicated and nuanced the balance became.” Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said administration action could be quicker than the sanctions Congress is considering, especially with the House away until the end of the month. “The administration has all the authorities that it needs under law to level the sanctions that many of us have talked about doing,” Rubio said. “I don’t want anyone to believe that somehow the U.S. won’t be able to respond with sanctions along with our allies if there is an invasion.” Still, senators are eager to act. A resolution would not carry the weight of law, but would nevertheless provide a record of Senate support for Ukraine’s independence in the face of Russian aggression. Such a measure, still being drafted, could come together for a vote, senators said. Late Monday, senators spoke about the strong, bipartisan support the Senate has shown for years toward Ukraine. Congress has approved aid and supplies, and many lawmakers have traveled to the country to stand alongside the Ukrainian people and their leaders. Tensions have mounted in the region as Putin demands assurances from the U.S. and its allies that it won’t accept Ukraine into NATO, a pledge Washington has rejected. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., said Putin’s ambitions extend beyond Ukraine as the Russian president tries to diminish the United States’ stature in Europe and erode the longstanding trans-Atlantic alliance. Shaheen says bipartisan discussions on Ukraine are “an opportunity to show the rest of the world we are united.”",western,1,641,94.61,42.81,26.53,20.23,20.03,28.71,83.31,57.25,44.46,4.68,2.18,0.31,1.09,0,0,0.78,2.5,14.04,10.76,0.16,15.13,7.33,2.5,5.62,1.09,15.29,3.59,2.34,14.51,2.65,1.87,9.83,10.14,0.31,9.83,1.25,0.62,2.34,1.56,0.16,3.43,0,3.12,1.56,1.56,0.31,0,0.31,0,0.31,0,0,11.23,7.49,2.34,0,0.94,0,3.59,4.21,0,0,0,0,9.83,9.2,0.62,0,4.37,0,0.62,3.59,0.16,0,0.31,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.31,0.47,0.47,0.31,0,0,0.47,0.94,0,2.03,9.52,0.31,1.72,6.86,0.62,0,0.16,3.43,2.96,4.68,0.94,0,0,0,0,0,19.19,7.18,5.46,0,0,2.18,4.37

Amid a buildup of an estimated 100,000 Russian troops near the border with Ukraine and massive joint war games with Belarus, the Defense Ministry said it will also conduct maneuvers involving the bulk of Russia’s naval potential. “The drills are intended to practice navy and air force action to protect Russian national interests in the world’s oceans and to counter military threats to the Russian Federation,” the ministry said, adding that they will start this month and run through February. It said the exercise will involve over 140 warships and more than 60 aircraft, and will be conducted in both littoral waters and more distant “operationally important” areas including the Mediterranean, northeastern Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean. The ministry said several Russian warships are currently taking part in a joint exercise with China and Iran in the Gulf of Oman that began Tuesday and will last until the weekend. U.S. President Joe Biden said  Wednesday he thinks Russia will invade Ukraine and warned President Vladimir Putin that his country would pay a “dear price” in lives lost and a possible cutoff from the global banking system if it does. Moscow has repeatedly denied having plans to launch an offensive. But it has sought a set of security guarantees from the West that would exclude NATO’s expansion to Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations and the deployment of alliance weapons there. Washington and its allies firmly rejected Moscow’s demands in security talks last week but kept the door open to possible further talks on arms control and confidence-building measures to reduce the potential for hostilities. Amid the tensions, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Ukraine Wednesday to reassure it of Western support and met with his British, French and German counterparts in Berlin on Thursday to discuss Ukraine  and other security matters. Blinken is set to meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Geneva on Friday. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova alleged that Ukrainian and Western claims of an imminent Russian attack on Ukraine were a “cover for staging large-scale provocations of their own, including those of military character.” “They may have extremely tragic consequences for the regional and global security,” Zakharova said. She pointed to the delivery of weapons to Ukraine by British military transport planes in recent days, claiming that Ukraine perceives Western military assistance as a “carte blanche for a military operation in Donbas.” Donbas, located in eastern Ukraine, is under control of Russia-backed separatists who have fought Ukrainian forces for nearly eight years, a conflict that has killed more than 14,000 people. Ukraine said earlier this week that it has taken the delivery of anti-tank missiles from the U.K. It has rejected Moscow’s claims that it plans an offensive to reclaim control of separatist-held areas in the country’s eastern industrial heartland. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the U.S. threat to cut off Russia from the global banking system could encourage hawkish forces in Ukraine to use force to reclaim control of the rebel east. “It may implant false hopes in the hotheads of some representatives of the Ukrainian leadership who may decide to quietly restart a civil war in their country,” Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. In a move that further beefs up forces near Ukraine, Russia has sent an unspecified number of troops from its far east to its ally Belarus, which shares a border with Ukraine, for major war games that run through Feb. 20. Ukrainian officials have said Moscow could use Belarusian territory to launch a potential multi-pronged invasion. The head of the European Union’s executive arm, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen reiterated Thursday that the EU “will respond with massive economic and financial sanctions” if Russia invades Ukraine. “We hope an attack won’t happen, but if it does, we are prepared,” von der Leyen said during an online speech to the Davos business forum. ___ Vanessa Gera in Warsaw, Poland, and Lorne Cook in Brussels, contributed to this report.",western,1,701,95.1,52.83,34.86,7.43,28.04,32.24,79.32,54.49,41.51,6.28,1.85,0,0.29,0.14,0.57,0.57,4.42,12.98,8.13,0.86,14.98,5.28,1.14,4.99,0.14,10.84,5.99,3.71,7.85,1.43,0.57,5.85,8.56,0,8.27,1,2,0.86,2.28,0.29,2.28,0,4.28,1.43,2.85,1.14,0.29,0.86,0,0.71,0.14,0,11.41,7.42,1,0,2.28,0.43,2.85,4.14,0,0.14,0.29,0.57,6.28,3.71,2.43,0.14,3.42,0.43,0.29,2.14,1,0,0.86,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.14,0.14,0,0.29,0.86,0,0,0,0,1.28,0.14,1.57,11.27,0.43,1.14,9.27,0,0.14,0.14,3.71,3.71,3.14,3,0.29,0.29,0.14,0,0,14.12,4.56,3.85,0,0,1.14,4.56

A draft agreement between Russia and its ally Belarus endorsed by Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin says that the Belarusian troops will work to provide “humanitarian assistance” to the population outside combat zones. The document, which is yet to be signed by the countries’ foreign and defense ministries, states that Belarusian troops will act under operational control of the Russian military in Syria when deployed to the country. Russia has waged a military campaign in Syria since 2015, teaming up with Iran to help Syrian President Bashar Assad’s government reclaim control over most of the country after a devastating civil war. The planned deployment of Belarusian troops’ to Syria reflects increasingly close defense ties between the two ex-Soviet neighbors and allies. In recent weeks, Russia has moved troops from Siberia and the Far East to Belarus for sweeping joint drills. The deployment added to the Russian military buildup near Ukraine, fueling Western fears of a possible invasion. Belarus’ authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko, who has increasingly relied on the Kremlin’s political and financial support amid bruising Western sanctions triggered by his crackdown on domestic protests, has called for closer defense ties with Moscow and recently offered to host Russian nuclear weapons. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the main opposition challenger to Lukashenko who was forced to leave the country after Lukashenko’s re-election to a sixth term in an August 2020 vote that the opposition and the West saw as rigged, strongly criticized the deal for sending Belarusian troops to Syria.

REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol WASHINGTON, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Lithuania is very worried about a Russian troop build up on Ukraine's eastern border and a NATO summit next week will try to find ways on how to deter Russia and reinforce the alliance's borders, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said  on Wednesday. Landsbergis also told Reuters in an interview after meeting U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman in Washington that Russian President Vladimir Putin might be using the Belarus border crisis as a tactical distraction to stir up wider instability in the region. ""Creating all those tactical instabilities on the border, having us all paying 100 percent attention to these issues, Putin might be ready to make a strategic move,"" Landsbergis said. He added that he was not sure about the scale of Moscow's next step ""if there would be a military action against Ukraine ... because in 2014 the scale was limited."" In 2014, Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine. ""It's very difficult now to be certain of the impact and their thinking,"" Landsbergis said. United States, NATO and Ukrainian officials have raised the alarm in recent weeks over what they say are unusual Russian troop movements closer to Ukraine, suggesting that Moscow may be poised to launch a new attack on its neighbor, accusations Russia has rejected as fear mongering. Both Russia and Ukraine staged military drills on Wednesday. Russia denies threatening anyone and says it can deploy its troops on its own territory as it pleases. It has accused Ukraine and NATO of whipping up tensions and suggested Kyiv might be preparing to try to seize back two eastern regions controlled by pro-Russian separatists since 2014. Ukraine is not a NATO member but the United States and the alliance have signaled their backing for Kyiv in ways that Moscow considers provocative. Russia's intentions remain unclear, and East-West tensions are running high with Ukraine, Russia and NATO all conducting military drills and Moscow accusing Washington of rehearsing a nuclear attack on Russia earlier this month. Next week's NATO ministerial meeting in the Latvian capital Riga was likely to be dominated by this issue, Landsbergis said. Asked if the he saw any U.S. willingness to be militarily involved in the event of a potential invasion, Landsbergis said: ""I feel the level of responsibility ... U.S. sees that you cannot leave the countries without at least ... without the political assistance."" He added that he never heard any promises from U.S. officials.

202,bbc.co.uk,2022-02-11 08:00:00,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-60351096,Ukraine crisis : united kingdom defence secretary warns Russia of tragic effects,English,United Kingdom,"A Russian invasion of Ukraine would have ""tragic consequences"" for both countries, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has warned his counterpart in Moscow. In talks with Sergei Shogiu, Mr Wallace said he urged dialogue to resolve the crisis in eastern Ukraine. But Mr Shogiu said growing military tensions in Europe were ""not our fault"". Russia denies it plans to invade but has 100,000 troops on Ukraine's border. At a news conference on Friday, Mr Wallace said that Russian forces were in a position to invade ""at any time"", but he had been given security assurances by Mr Shogiu. ""I was clear about the tragic consequences that any invasion of Ukraine could have for all people - both Ukrainian, Russian and the security of Europe,"" Mr Wallace said of his meeting with the Russian defence minister. ""We listened to the assurances given by minister Shoigu that they would not invade Ukraine."" Security concerns have grown in recent days after Russia started huge military drills with neighbouring Belarus and was accused of blocking Ukraine's access to the sea. US President Joe Biden has also called on all American citizens remaining in Ukraine to leave the country immediately, citing increased threats of Russian military action. Russia has made a series of security proposals, including a demand to rule out Ukraine's membership of the Nato defence alliance. Western countries have rejected this and instead put forward other suggestions, such as cutting back nuclear weaponry. Mr Shogiu said the counter-proposals submitted by Nato and the US had now been reviewed and promised ""our response will follow shortly"". The talks between Mr Wallace and Mr Shogiu were the latest in a period of frenzied diplomacy intended to defuse the current crisis in eastern Ukraine. The current tensions come eight years after Russia annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula. Since then, Ukraine's military has been locked in a war with Russian-backed rebels in eastern areas near Russia's borders. The UK's relations with Russia have deteriorated in recent years after a string of diplomatic disputes, including the poisoning of Sergei Skripal in 2018. Mr Shogiu said Russia's ties with the UK were ""close to zero"". But when asked about the state of UK-Russia relations, Mr Wallace said they were ""a lot better than 0%"" after Friday's talks. Ben Wallace's trip to Moscow does not signal any significant shift in the balance of this crisis. But his meeting with Russian defence chiefs does seem to have been a calmer affair than Thursday's frosty exchanges between the foreign ministers, Liz Truss and Sergei Lavrov. Mr Wallace states the UK government's position in the minor key compared to the fortissimo of the foreign secretary. In diplomatic confrontations like this, improved communications between defence ministers and senior officers can sometimes help avoid miscalculation. The military element can take some of the politics out of the relationship. And if there is to be any common ground between Nato and Russia, it may well be found in military matters, such as improving transparency about each other's missiles and exercises, and reviving lapsed arms control agreements. Also of note was Mr Wallace's emphasis - again - that restoring the Minsk accords could be a potential diplomatic route out of the stand-off. The problem with that is the accords - signed in 2014 and 2015 to try to establish a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine - are much disputed and have failed to achieve their aim. Friday's talks appeared more constructive than those of a day earlier between UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and her Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on Thursday. They proved to be ill-tempered as Ms Truss urged Russia to move its troops away from the Ukrainian border and accused it of ""Cold War rhetoric"". Mr Lavrov said he was disappointed with the talks, accusing Ms Truss of not listening to Russia's concerns and describing their conversation as ""a dialogue between a deaf person and someone who was mute"". When asked about these comments, Mr Wallace said Mr Lavrov was ""a master at these types of engagements and making those type of comments"", but that there had been no deafness or blindness in his talks with Mr Shoigu. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited Poland and Brussels as part of a surge of UK diplomatic activity. In a joint news conference with Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg, Mr Johnson said Europe faced its biggest security crisis in decades. PM says we must oppose any return to the days where ""great powers"" decide the ""fates of nations"" Moscow says it cannot accept that Ukraine - a former Soviet republic with deep social and cultural ties with Russia - could one day join the Western defence alliance Nato and has demanded that this be ruled out. Russia has been backing a bloody armed rebellion in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region since 2014. Some 14,000 people - including many civilians - have died in fighting since then. There is some suggestion that a renewed focus on the so-called Minsk agreements - which sought to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine - could be used as a basis to defuse the current crisis. Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany backed the accords in 2014-2015. Earlier this week, French President Emmanuel Macron said he thought a deal to avoid full-scale war in Ukraine was possible.",western,1,871,91.98,61.88,32.47,3.1,22.92,28.59,80.37,57.18,44.32,5.4,2.41,0.11,0.57,0,1.03,0.57,2.99,13.32,7.23,1.26,15.96,6.89,2.18,6.08,0.69,12.86,5.86,3.33,7,1.72,0.92,4.36,8.5,0.34,8.15,1.03,1.72,1.26,1.49,0.46,2.53,0,4.71,1.15,3.56,0.69,0.11,0.57,0,0.23,0.34,0.11,14.47,9.76,0.34,2.64,1.72,0.57,4.13,6.54,0,0,0.34,2.87,4.71,3.1,1.49,0.11,1.38,0,0.11,1.26,0,0,0.69,0.11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.11,0.69,0,0.23,0,0,0,0,1.84,0,3.21,10.56,0.34,0.69,8.5,0.34,0.57,0.34,5.05,6.54,3.33,0.69,0,0,0,0,0,14.7,4.36,3.1,0,0,1.95,5.28

The White House said Friday that U.S. intelligence officials had concluded that Russia had already deployed operatives to rebel-controlled eastern Ukraine to carry out acts of sabotage there and blame them on Ukraine in a “false-flag operation” to create a pretext for possible invasion. Speaking to reporters Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov dismissed the U.S. claim as “total disinformation.” He reaffirmed that Russia expects a written response this week from the U.S. and its allies to Moscow’s request for binding guarantees that NATO will not embrace Ukraine or any other ex-Soviet nations, or station its forces and weapons there. Washington and its allies firmly rejected  Moscow’s demands during last week’s Russia-U.S. negotiations in Geneva and a related NATO-Russia meeting in Brussels, which were held as an estimated 100,000 Russian troops with tanks and other heavy weapons are massed near Ukraine in what the West fears might be a prelude to an invasion. Amid the troops buildup, Russia in recent weeks has held a series of war games in regions that border Ukraine. On Monday, the military announced the launch of another exercise involving armored units stationed in the western part of Russia that includes 300 combat vehicles. A delegation of U.S. senators is visiting Ukraine to emphasize U.S. support for the country. “Our bipartisan congressional delegation sends a clear message to the global community: the United States stands in unwavering support of our Ukrainian partners to defend their sovereignty and in the face of persistent Russian aggression,” Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, said in a statement. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, said after the delegation met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that if Russia invades Ukraine “we will impose crippling economic sanctions, but more important we will give the people of Ukraine the arms, lethal arms they need to defend their lives and livelihoods.” Speaking Monday on a visit to Kyiv, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock warned that “any further escalation would carry a high price for the Russian regime — economic, political and strategic” — and emphasized the need to continue negotiations. “We are prepared to have a serious dialogue with Russia, because diplomacy is the only way to defuse this highly dangerous situation,” she said. Baerbock said Germany has offered to send cybersecurity specialists to Ukraine to help investigate last week’s cyberattacks, which Ukrainian authorities have blamed on Russia. At the same time, she noted that Germany hasn’t changed its refusal to provide it with weapons. “We made clear that we will do everything to avoid escalating the crisis,” she said. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on a visit to Spain that “we expect clear steps from Russia to deescalate the situation,” adding that “military aggression against Ukraine would entail serious political and economic consequences.” Ukrainian officials have warned that Russia could launch an attack from various directions, including from the territory of its ally Belarus. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, who has increasingly relied on the Kremlin’s support amid Western sanctions over a brutal crackdown on domestic protests, said Russia and Belarus will hold massive military drills next month. Lukashenko said the maneuvers will be conducted on Belarus’ western border and also in the country’s south, where it borders Ukraine. Belarus Security Council Secretary Alexander Volfovich said Monday that Russian troops already had started arriving in the country for the exercise, according to the BELTA news agency. Russia has denied having plans to attack its neighbor and in turn accused the Ukrainian leadership of hatching plans to use force to reclaim control of Russian-backed rebel-held territories in eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian authorities have denied it. Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 after the ouster of Ukraine’s Moscow-friendly leader and also threw its weight behind a separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine. More than 14,000 people have been killed in nearly eight years of fighting there. Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that Moscow will take unspecified “military-technical measures” if the West stonewalls its demands. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, who led the Russian delegation at the talks with the U.S. in Geneva, said last week that he would “neither confirm nor exclude” the possibility of Russia sending military assets to Cuba and Venezuela if the U.S. and its allies don’t curtail their military activities on Russia’s doorstep. U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan has dismissed the comments as bluster. Asked Monday about the possibility of Russian missile deployment to Cuba and Venezuela, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that “Russia is thinking about how to ensure its security in the context of the current situation.” ___ Yuras Karmanau reported from Kyiv, Ukraine.

The defence ministry said that large-scale drills continued but that some units were returning to their bases. There has been no independent confirmation of the withdrawal and international powers have reacted cautiously to the announcement. More than 100,000 Russian troops have massed at Ukraine's border. Russia has always denied it is planning an attack. Russia has deep cultural and historic ties with Ukraine, and has been seeking guarantees it will not join the Nato military alliance, something the bloc has refused to promise. Troops began gathering in large numbers last November, bringing increasingly dire warnings about Russia's intentions. In recent days the US warned an invasion could be imminent, and moved its embassy out of the capital Kyiv. Nato said the Russian announcement gave cause for ""cautious optimism"" but that they had not seen evidence of de-escalation on the ground. In its statement, Russia's defence ministry said it was withdrawing some of the troops conducting exercises in military districts bordering Ukraine. ""A number of combat training exercises, including drills, have been conducted as planned,"" defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said. Some exercises are continuing, such as a large joint Russia-Belarus drill, due to end on 20 February. A British government source said it was waiting to see the scale of the withdrawal, saying it would have to make a difference to the ability to invade to be meaningful. Watch: Russia video appears to show tanks leaving Ukrainian border area But the announcement was enough for both Ukraine and Russia to claim victory in the stand-off. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dymytro Kuleba said he would believe the withdrawal when he sees it but ""we have managed together with our partners to deter Russia from any further escalation"". A Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said the day ""will go into history as the day western war propaganda failed. They have been disgraced and destroyed without a single shot being fired."" For weeks there have been regular reports of Russia increasing troop numbers near the border with Ukraine. Now Moscow has announced that - drills over - some units are returning to base. A sign of de-escalation? Possibly. But caution is required. The number of troops packing up and moving back is unclear. Moscow, of course, has insisted all along it has no plans for a military escalation in Ukraine. The Russian authorities have dismissed claims by Western governments that a Russian invasion is imminent. President Putin's spokesman said the Kremlin leader had mocked such assertions. ""Sometimes [Putin] even jokes about it,"" Dmitry Peskov told journalists. ""He asks us to check whether they [in the West] have published the exact time that war will start."" In another development, the Russian parliament has voted in favour of asking Mr Putin to recognise the two self-declared republics of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine as independent. Russia has granted citizenship to at least 720,000 people in the two areas, which are in the Donbas region where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014. But if Mr Putin were to approve the decision and recognise the two breakaway regions, it would violate peace agreements. ""If that happens, that will be a blatant violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty once again, because there is no doubt that Donetsk and Luhansk are part of Ukraine within internationally recognised borders,"" Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels. Meanwhile, Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz is in Moscow for talks with President Putin as part of diplomatic efforts aimed at warding off a potential crisis. Mr Scholz has faced criticism for his response to the tensions. He has refused to commit publicly to scrapping the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline connecting Russia and Germany in the event of Russian aggression against Ukraine, saying only that all sanctions options remain on the table. This is in contrast to US President Joe Biden, who has said the scheme would be halted if Russia invades.",western,1,673,87.11,47.1,45.75,6.26,18.69,31.05,81.13,58.69,46.06,6.09,2.08,0,0.59,0,0.74,0.59,4.01,13.37,7.43,1.49,14.26,9.21,2.53,4.75,0.74,16.49,4.16,5.05,8.32,2.08,1.19,5.2,10.25,0.74,9.36,1.49,1.34,0.74,1.63,0.89,3.71,0,3.71,1.04,2.67,0.45,0.15,0.3,0.15,0.15,0,0,11.44,7.13,0.45,0.59,1.19,0.15,3.57,5.05,0,0,0.15,1.49,5.5,3.86,1.63,0,1.49,0.15,0,1.34,0,0,0.45,0.45,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.74,0,0.15,0,0.15,0,0,0.74,0,3.71,11.29,1.04,1.34,8.47,0.89,0,0.15,4.01,5.65,4.75,1.78,0,0,0,0,0,14.86,5.2,4.01,0.15,0,1.04,4.46

Sputnik/Sergey Guneev/Pool via REUTERS MOSCOW, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said in an interview broadcast on Sunday that he had rejected a defence ministry proposal to hold snap Black Sea military drills in response to NATO activity because he did not want to escalate tensions in the region. Russia has complained about what it has called a dangerous increase in military activity by the United States and its allies in the Black Sea region with greater Western spy plane activity, more strategic bombers flights, and the presence of two U.S. warships.  read more Some of the activity has been taking place in the vicinity of Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014 and which Kyiv wants back.

The charges against Siarhei Tsikhanouski included organizing mass unrest and inciting hatred and have been widely seen as politically motivated. Five other opposition activists were sentenced to lengthy prison terms of 14 to 16 years alongside Tsikhanouski. Tsikhanouski, 43, a popular video blogger and activist, planned to challenge authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko in the August 2020 presidential election. He was widely known for the anti-Lukashenko slogan “Stop the cockroach.” He was arrested in May 2020, two days after he declared his candidacy. His wife, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, ran in his stead, drawing tens of thousands of people to rally in her support during the campaign. Official results of the vote handed Lukashenko a landslide victory and a sixth term in office, but were denounced by opposition and the West as a sham. The results triggered a months-long wave of unprecedented mass protests, the largest of which saw some 200,000 people taking to the streets of the Belarusian capital of Minsk. Lukashenko’s government unleashed a violent crackdown on the demonstrators, arresting more than 35,000 and brutally beating thousands. Tsikhanouskaya fled the country to Lithuania a day after the vote under pressure from the authorities. Other key opposition figures have also left the country, while some have ended up behind bars. In recent months, pressure has mounted on Belarus’ non-governmental organizations, activists and journalists, with the authorities regularly conducting mass raids and detentions of those they suspect of supporting the anti-government protests. The majority of independent media outlets and rights groups in Belarus have now been shut down. Commenting on the verdict in her husband’s case, Tsikhanouskaya told The Associated Press that “the dictator publicly retaliates against his strongest opponents, they’re being repressed for their desire to live in a free Belarus.” “We will not stop and will continue the fight with the dictatorship in the center of Europe,” Tsikhanouskaya, who raises two children, added. “I don’t have the right to tell my children that they won’t see their father for so many years, because I don’t believe it myself.” Siarhei Tsikhanouski has already spent 20 months behind bars. His trial was shrouded in secrecy, with court hearings held behind closed doors and lawyers bound by non-disclosure agreements. State media showed a tired-looking Tsikhanouski being led into the closed hearing, along with other defendants who include Mikola Statkevich, who ran against Lukashenko in 2010 and was sentenced to six years in prison after demonstrations broke out following that election. Statkevich was arrested again in May 2020 and on Tuesday was sentenced to 14 years in prison. Another popular blogger who also stood trial alongside Tsikhanouski, 29-year-old Ihar Losik, was handed a 15-year sentence. Losik was holding a hunger strike in jail to protest his prosecution. U.S. ambassador to Belarus Julie Fisher said on Twitter that “it is clear whom the regime most fears.” “The United States, alongside our partners, will continue efforts to secure the unconditional release of all political prisoners, including Siarhei Tsikhanouski, Ihar Losik and all those facing unjust detention and vengeful verdicts,” she wrote. Germany Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock called the verdict against the opposition leader in Belarus “scandalous” during a news conference Tuesday in Stockholm with her Swedish and Norwegian counterparts. “They disgrace the rule of law and the international obligations of Belarus (with) this ruling,” Baerbock said, adding that Germany is calling for the immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners in Belarus — “the 900 and also the two who were sentenced today.” ___ Follow all AP stories on Belarus at https://apnews.com/hub/Belarus.",western,1,620,94.61,61.15,35.88,1,22.14,32.74,77.58,55.48,45,6.94,5,0.65,0.32,0,2.1,0.97,1.94,15.81,8.55,4.19,15.65,5,1.61,5.32,0.65,10.16,4.19,5.97,9.52,1.13,0.81,7.74,5.16,0.65,4.35,1.13,0.97,0.16,0,0,2.1,0,5.16,0.65,4.35,0.97,0,0.81,0.16,0.48,0,0,11.77,4.35,0.32,0,1.77,0.48,2.1,6.61,0.97,0,0.81,1.94,4.52,3.55,0.48,0.48,2.26,0.32,0,1.45,0.16,0.32,0.48,0.16,0,0,0,0,0,0.16,0,0.16,0.16,0.16,0.32,0,0.16,0,0.32,0,2.9,9.03,0,0.81,7.42,0.65,0.16,0,6.29,6.29,1.61,0.81,0.16,0.16,0,0,0,18.06,5,5.81,0,0,1.29,5.97
343,bbc.co.uk,2022-02-21 08:00:00,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60468264,Ukraine crisis : Five reasons why Putin might not invade,English,United Kingdom,"The optics look dreadful. Russia has deployed more than two-thirds of its military combat capability to within striking distance of Ukraine's borders. Its 30,000 troops that were supposed to withdraw from neighbouring Belarus at the weekend are still there. So are pontoon bridges and other logistic equipment needed for an invasion. Violence is flaring in the two Russian-backed breakaway republics in Eastern Ukraine. Russia's demands from Nato remain unmet and diplomacy has so far failed to bring about any significant withdrawal of Russian forces. Meanwhile western leaders and their intelligence chiefs have been sounding the alarm, asserting that President Putin has already given the order to invade Ukraine. And yet, there are reasons to believe that a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine might not happen. Here are some of them. Ukraine will resist, at least initially. Its forces are vastly outnumbered and outgunned by Russia's but that doesn't mean there won't be severe casualties on both sides. If Moscow were to undertake a full-scale invasion, capturing the major cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odessa by force then it could well involve protracted and costly street fighting where the Ukrainians would be on home ground. A recent poll of young Russians found that a majority were opposed to waging war against their Slavic neighbour. The prospect of large numbers of both Russians and Ukrainians dying in a war of Putin's choice and Russians coming home in coffins will not play well at home. How deep the threatened western sanctions go will, in all likelihood, depend on how deep Russia goes into Ukraine. Much as western leaders talk of Nato unanimity the reality is that Germany and Hungary, for example, which depend in large part on Russian gas, are not as hawkish as Britain, which is not. But sanctions will still hurt the relatively small Russian economy, especially if it is frozen out of the Swift banking system as some are calling for. When Russia invaded and annexed Crimea in 2014 it became an international pariah for years. The same would happen this time, only worse. Even China, a strategic ally, has warned against it with its Foreign Minister Wang Yi telling the Munich Security Conference: ""The sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of every country should be safeguarded. Ukraine is no exception."" US Senator Chris Murphy believes that contrary to the optics, Putin is in a severely weak position and ""a potentially disastrous invasion of Ukraine would be his last resort"". He believes that after 2013 Ukraine's people made it clear they no longer wanted to be in Russia's orbit and forcing them back with a costly war would devastate the Russian economy and possibly even unseat President Putin. Moscow has now got the West's attention when it comes to the perceived injustices of the post-Cold War security order in Europe. From Putin's perspective, Nato has reneged on the deal not to expand eastwards towards Russia's borders. Not only have the three Baltic republics (all former Soviet Socialist Republics) Poland and other former Warsaw Pact countries all joined Nato but now the prospect of neighbouring Ukraine doing the same is too much for Moscow to bear. Putin wants this changed or the Damoclean sword of a Russian invasion will forever hang over Ukraine. ""He wants to negotiate a new security deal but from a position of strength"" says Ghanem Nuseibeg, a Senior Visiting Fellow at Harvard. ""In a way he has already partially succeeded with Macron talking of a new security order."" Set against all of the above are some very compelling reasons to believe that a Russian invasion will happen, and imminently, even if it is confined to just the two internationally unrecognised breakaway republics in the east of Ukraine. The size, scale and nature of Russia's military build-up go far beyond the needs of a normal military exercise. You don't ask soldiers to give blood to field dressing stations if you're just on manoeuvres. Moscow's two core demands from the West remain unmet, namely a promise that Ukraine will never be allowed to join Nato and that the western alliance withdraw all its forces from countries that joined Nato after 1997. Ultimately, the Kremlin has clearly decided that it cannot tolerate its giant, Slavic-speaking neighbour Ukraine being firmly in the western camp, becoming part of Nato and the EU. President Putin has made it abundantly clear by his actions so far that he will do whatever it takes to stop that from happening.",western,1,743,75.95,29.61,49.38,7.92,21.23,28.67,83.45,62.45,49.66,6.73,1.88,0,0.13,0.27,0.81,0.67,4.85,14.27,7.4,1.08,13.73,8.21,6.06,5.65,1.75,14.54,6.06,4.58,8.34,1.62,0.54,6.19,12.92,1.35,11.44,2.02,2.02,2.02,1.75,0.27,4.44,0,4.31,1.48,2.83,0.13,0,0.13,0,0,0,0,7,2.96,0.27,0,0.67,0.27,0.94,3.9,0,0.13,0,0.81,5.52,3.63,1.88,0,2.96,0.27,0.94,1.21,0.67,0,0.94,0.27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.27,0.27,0.13,0,0.13,0.81,0,3.1,11.31,0.54,0.94,9.69,0.4,0.13,0.13,3.77,2.83,5.52,2.56,0,0,0,0,0,12.79,4.71,3.63,0,0,2.02,2.42

A statement cited the ""deterioration of the situation"" in east Ukraine as one reason for keeping an estimated 30,000 Russian troops in Belarus. The move will add to fears that Russia plans an invasion of Ukraine, which shares a long border with Belarus. Western leaders have accused Moscow of seeking a pretext to send in troops. Russia has denied it plans to invade its neighbour. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the extension of military exercises shows the world is on the brink of war. The BBC's Eastern Europe correspondent Sarah Rainsford said the announcement - made by the Belarus defence ministry - is another strong signal that Russia is not prepared to back down in its stand-off with Western countries over Ukraine. In a phone call on Sunday, Mr Putin told French President Emmanuel Macron the Russian troops would eventually leave Belarus, the French presidency said. Mr Putin blamed the Ukrainian military for the escalation of tensions in the Donbas. France said the pair agreed to work for a ceasefire on the contact line in eastern Ukraine. Watch the moment Ukrainian officials run from apparent shelling in the eastern part of the country There were more explosions in the east Ukrainian conflict zone through the night and into Sunday. Detonations could be heard from the separatist-held city of Donetsk while both sides said they had come under heavy shell fire. As explosions boomed out in Donetsk on Sunday morning, Russian-backed rebels in Luhansk accused government forces of crossing the front line to mount an attack which killed two civilians. No proof was given for the allegation but Russian investigators opened an inquiry. The rebels and government forces accused each other of violating the ceasefire dozens of time on Sunday. Two Ukrainian soldiers were killed on Saturday as international monitors reported that ceasefire violations had increased dramatically this week. Thousands of civilians are being evacuated from the separatist territories into Russia while men of fighting age are being mobilised to fight. Speaking as she prepared to leave Donetsk for Russia by bus with her four-year-old daughter, an evacuee who gave her name as Tatyana told Reuters news agency: ""It's really scary. I've taken everything I could carry."" By Orla Guerin, BBC News, Novotroitske The frontlines in eastern Ukraine are rarely silent - at the very least there is sniper fire between Kremlin-backed rebels and Ukrainian forces. But now the big guns are back. In recent days there has been a barrage of artillery and mortar fire. We heard it ourselves at frontline positions in Novotroitske. We reached the trenches on foot, crossing flat ground where snow has given way to sucking layers of mud. Two fresh-faced troops led the way, standing stock still at the rumble of shelling a few kilometres away. At a sandbagged lookout position 24-year-old Taras told us there had been three days of heavy incoming fire. ""I think Putin is doing it on purpose to provoke us,"" he said. ""The situation has gotten worse, but we tolerate it, and we wait."" Ukrainian forces say they have orders not to return fire - except in exceptional cases - as Russia is ""looking for any excuse to invade"". Taras had a deadpan expression, and a phlegmatic approach to a possible invasion. ""They might raze us to the ground,"" he told me, ""and they might not. And we don't know if we will have support or not. If it gets too hard, we will open fire too."" Russia has mustered up to 190,000 troops including separatist forces in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, according to US estimates. Western leaders, meanwhile, are preparing sanctions against Russia in case of an invasion. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson told BBC News sanctions would hit ""very very hard"". He said he had seen evidence Russia is planning ""the biggest war in Europe since 1945"". The President of the European Council Charles Michel has said the EU is ready to impose massive sanctions on the Kremlin - even harming its own economy if necessary - to confront Russian military aggression. But Ukraine's President Volodymr Zelensky has accused Western leaders of a ""policy of appeasement"" towards Moscow and demanded security guarantees for Ukraine, which officially aspires to join both Nato and the EU. Mr Putin has been demanding assurances that Nato will not admit Ukraine, a former Soviet state with close ties to Russia, while the Western alliance denies it poses any threat to Russia. There are fears that a Russian military intervention could start a war even bloodier than the conflict in eastern Ukraine which has cost at least 14,000 lives.",western,1,783,91.93,58.31,64.58,2.09,19.1,27.46,81.74,57.34,45.47,6.77,3.83,0.51,1.66,0,1.02,0.51,2.94,12.39,8.3,1.66,14.94,7.28,2.43,3.96,0.89,13.67,4.98,3.96,10.22,2.94,0.77,6.51,9.58,0.26,9.32,1.28,1.53,0.77,1.4,0.51,3.7,0,4.34,0.77,3.58,0.51,0,0.51,0.38,0.13,0,0,12.77,6.51,0.38,0.38,2.04,0.77,2.81,6.51,0.13,0.13,0.51,1.15,5.36,2.94,2.3,0.13,2.04,0,0.13,1.66,0.26,0,0.64,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.26,0.13,0.13,0.38,0,0,0,0,0.38,0.26,3.19,14.3,0.51,1.53,11.11,0.64,0.77,0.64,3.83,5.36,3.7,2.17,0,0,0,0,0,13.79,5.24,3.19,0,0,0.64,4.73

The Feb. 3-8 exercises were to be held 240 kilometers (150 miles) off southwestern Ireland — in international waters but within Ireland’s exclusive economic zone. Ireland is a member of the 27-nation European Union but not a member of NATO. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney this week objected to the war games, saying “This isn’t a time to increase military activity and tension in the context of what’s happening with and in Ukraine. The fact that they are choosing to do it on the western borders, if you like, of the EU, off the Irish coast, is something that in our view is simply not welcome.” Russia’s embassy in Ireland on Saturday posted a letter on Facebook from Ambassador Yuriy Filatov saying the exercises would be relocated outside of the Irish economic zone ”with the aim not to hinder fishing activities.” The decision was a rare concession amid the escalating tensions surrounding Russia’s massing of an estimated 100,000 troops near the border with Ukraine and its demands that NATO promise never to allow Ukraine to join the alliance, stop the deployment of NATO weapons near Russian borders and roll back its forces from Eastern Europe. The U.S. and NATO formally rejected those demands this week, although Washington outlined areas where discussions are possible, offering hope that there could be a way to avoid war. Russian President Vladimir Putin has made no public remarks about the Western response. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said it leaves little chance for reaching agreement, though he also says Russia does not want war. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Friday that Putin could use any portion of his force to seize Ukrainian cities and “significant territories” or to carry out “coercive acts or provocative political acts” like the recognition of breakaway territories inside Ukraine. Two territories in eastern Ukraine have been under the control of Russia-backed rebels since 2014, after Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine. A Russian lawmaker is encouraging residents of those areas of Ukraine to join the Russian army, a sign that Moscow is continuing to try to integrate those territories as much as possible. Viktor Vodolatsky said Saturday that residents in rebels-held areas in eastern Ukraine fear assaults by Ukrainian forces and that those who hold Russian passports would be welcomed in the Russian military. “If Russian citizens residing in the (territories) want to join the Russian Armed Forces, the Rostov regional military commissariat will register and draft them,” Vodolatsky, deputy chairman of parliament committee on relations with neighbors, told the state news agency Tass. Russia has granted passports to more than 500,000 people in the rebel-held territories. Vodolatsky said the recruits would serve in Russia — but that leaves open the option that they could join any future invasion force. A senior official in President Joe Biden’s administration said the U.S. welcomed Lavrov’s comments that Russia does not want war, “but this needs to be backed up with action. We need to see Russia pulling some of the troops that they have deployed away from the Ukrainian border and taking other de-escalatory steps.” The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk publicly. Lavrov has said the U.S. suggested the two sides could talk about limits on the deployment of intermediate-range missiles, restrictions on military drills and rules to prevent accidents between warships and aircraft. He said the Russians proposed discussing those issues years ago, but Washington and its allies never took them up on it. He also said those issues are secondary to Russia’s main concerns about NATO. He said international agreements say the security of one nation must not come at the expense of others, and said he would send letters to his Western counterparts asking them to explain their failure to respect that pledge. Washington has warned Moscow of devastating sanctions if it invades Ukraine, including penalties targeting top Russian officials and key economic sectors. Lavrov said Moscow had warned Washington that sanctions would amount to a complete severing of ties. NATO, meanwhile, said it was bolstering its deterrence in the Baltic Sea region. Russia has launched military drills involving motorized infantry and artillery units in southwestern Russia, warplanes in Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea, and dozens of warships in the Black Sea and the Arctic. Russian troops are also in Belarus for joint drills, raising Western fears that Moscow could stage an attack on Ukraine from the north from Belarus.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed Western media reports that Moscow has intentions to invade Ukraine as a “hollow and unfounded attempt to incite tensions.” “Russia doesn’t threaten anyone,” Peskov said during a conference call with reporters. “The movement of troops on our territory shouldn’t be a cause for anyone’s concern.” Ukraine complained last week that Russia has kept tens of thousands of troops not far from the two countries’ borders after conducting war games in an attempt to exert further pressure on its ex-Soviet neighbor. Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and has supported a separatist insurgency that broke out that year in eastern Ukraine. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry claimed that about 90,000 Russian troops are stationed not far from the border and in rebel-controlled areas in Ukraine’s east. It said units of the Russian 41st army have remained in Yelnya, a town about 260 kilometers (about 160 miles) north of the Ukrainian border. The commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, Lt. Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhny, said Friday that Russia has about 2,100 military personnel in the rebel-controlled areas, noting that Russian military officers hold all commanding positions in the separatist forces. Russia has cast its weight behind the separatist insurgency in Ukraine’s east that has left more than 14,000 dead. But Moscow has repeatedly denied any presence of its troops in eastern Ukraine. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken assured the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, in Washington this week that the U.S. commitment to Ukraine’s security and territorial integrity is “ironclad.” On Friday, Blinken pointed at Russia’s previous aggressive actions against Ukraine. “From what they’ve done the past, we have real concerns about what we’re seeing in the present,” he said. “We don’t know Russia’s intentions,” Blinken told reporters in Washington. “But we do know that we’ve seen in the past: Russia mass forces on Ukraine’s borders, claim some kind of provocation by Ukraine, and then invade. That’s what they did in 2014.” Blinken said the U.S. was “in very close consultation with European allies and partners on this.” Asked Thursday if Russia planned to invade Ukraine, Russia’s deputy U.N. ambassador, Dmitry Polyansky, replied that it “never planned, never did, and (is) never going to do it unless we’re provoked by Ukraine, or by somebody else.” He cited what he called many threats from Ukraine and allegedly provocative actions by U.S. warships in the Black Sea. Peskov similarly emphasized Friday that Russia needs to protect its security amid what he described as “increasing provocations” near its borders. He pointed at the U.S. naval deployment to the Black Sea and increasingly frequent U.S. and NATO intelligence flights. “We take measures to ensure our security when our opponents take defiant action near our borders,” Peskov said. “We can’t stay indifferent to that; we must be on our guard.” The Russian Defense Ministry described the deployment of the U.S. warships USS Mount Whitney and USS Porter, which sailed into the Black Sea last week, as a “threat to regional security and strategic stability.” “The real goal behind the U.S. activities in the Black Sea region is exploring the theater of operations in case of Kyiv’s attempts to settle the conflict in the southeast by force,” the ministry said in a statement. The reported Russian military buildup near Ukraine also raised concern in the European Union. After discussing the issue with U.S. President Joe Biden earlier this week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said EU officials “fully support the territorial integrity of Ukraine.” European Commission spokesman Peter Stano told reporters Friday that the bloc is discussing the situation with partners, including the U.S. and United Kingdom, adding that “the information we gathered so far is rather worrying.” French foreign and defense ministers expressed their concerns about the situation in Ukraine during Friday talks with their Russian counterparts in Paris. Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and Defense Minister Florence Parly “clearly warned of the serious consequences of any further possible damage to the territorial integrity of Ukraine,” the French Foreign Ministry said in a statement after the meeting. French President Emmanuel Macron said later Friday he will speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the “coming days” about the situation in Ukraine and Belarus. ___ AP Diplomatic Writer Matthew Lee in Washington, Angela Charlton and Sylvie Corbet in Paris, Yuras Karmanau in Kyiv, Ukraine and Lorne Cook in Brussels contributed to this report.",western,1,765,91.83,72.4,43.76,9.05,21.25,32.55,76.99,53.33,41.18,8.63,3.4,0,1.96,0.13,0.78,0.52,5.23,13.07,7.45,1.31,15.42,4.44,2.35,4.44,1.18,9.93,5.75,2.22,9.54,3.4,0.65,5.62,8.5,0.52,7.58,1.05,1.31,0.78,1.44,0.92,2.22,0,2.35,0.52,1.7,0.65,0,0.52,0.13,0.26,0,0,13.73,7.06,0.78,0.13,1.57,0,3.92,6.93,0,0,0,1.18,7.45,5.23,2.22,0,2.22,0.26,0.13,1.83,0,0,0.39,0.13,0,0.13,0,0,0,0.13,0.13,0.26,0,0.39,0,0.13,0,0.13,1.57,0.13,1.83,12.55,0.39,0.92,10.33,0.92,0,0.13,4.31,4.18,2.88,0.65,0.13,0.13,0,0,0,21.57,7.45,4.44,0,0,2.75,6.93

Air India's Dreamliner B-787 aircraft with a capacity of over 200 seats has been deployed, reports ANI news agency. This comes as 150,000 Russian troops are positioned close to Ukraine's borders. Russia's Vladmir Putin has denied planning to attack Ukraine but the US believes he will soon. India has told the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) that the safety and security of its nationals is essential. ""More than 20,000 Indian students and nationals live and study in different parts of Ukraine, including in its border areas. The well-being of Indians is of priority to us,"" India's Permanent Representative to United Nations, TS Tirumurti said, according to ANI news agency. Air India had announced on 18 February that it would operate three flights between India and Ukraine's Boryspil International Airport on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday this week. The first of the three flights from Ukraine will land in capital Delhi on Tuesday night, ANI reports. The Embassy of India in Kyiv issued an advisory on the special flights on Monday, tweeting that additional flights are being organised ""in view of the continued high level of tensions and uncertainties of the current situation in Ukraine"". The Indian government had removed restrictions on flights to and from Ukraine earlier this month. The move from Delhi comes amid increasing tensions in the region. According to the US, Russia has moved more than 150,000 troops close to Ukraine's borders, both in Russia and Belarus. Russia says it has no plans to invade Ukraine but on 18 February, US President Joe Biden said he believed Mr Putin had decided to attack ""in the coming days"". Several Western nations accuse Russia of cooking up a fake crisis in certain regions in Ukraine to give it a reason to launch an offensive. At an emergency meeting called by the UNSC, India said the escalation of tensions ""is a matter of deep concern"". ""We call for restraint on all sides. We're convinced that this issue can only be resolved through diplomatic dialogue. We need to give space to recent initiatives undertaken by parties which seek to diffuse tensions,"" Mr Tirumurti said. India said it strongly emphasises the ""vital need for all sides to maintain international peace and security by exercising the utmost restraint and intensifying diplomatic efforts to ensure that a mutually amicable solution is arrived at the earliest.""

631,apnews.com,2022-01-28 08:00:00,https://apnews.com/8593998c182f17caafeb57fe93f7578c,Russia says it wont start a war as Ukraine tensions mount,English,United States,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Friday the buildup of Russian forces along Ukraine’s border has reached the point where President Vladimir Putin now has a complete range of military options, including actions short of a full-scale invasion. “While we don’t believe that President Putin has made a final decision to use these forces against Ukraine, he clearly now has the capability,” Austin told a Pentagon news conference. In Moscow, the Kremlin said Putin told French President Emmanuel Macron that the West has failed to take Russian security concerns into account, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told a radio interviewer that Russia doesn’t want war but sees no room for compromise on its demands. Austin said Putin could use any portion of his force of an estimated 100,000 troops to seize Ukrainian cities and “significant territories” or to carry out “coercive acts or provocative political acts” like the recognition of breakaway territories inside Ukraine. He urged Putin to de-escalate tensions, and appeared to warn Moscow against what the White House recently said was Russia’s intent to paint Ukraine as the aggressor using a “false-flag operation” to justify an attack. “We remain focused on Russian disinformation, including the potential creation of pretext for further invasion or strikes on Donbas,” said Austin. “This is straight out of the Russian playbook. They’re not fooling us.” Austin spoke alongside Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in what were their first extensive public comments about the crisis, marking a subtle shift in the administration’s approach to public communications about the escalating situation. While both have consulted regularly with their NATO and Ukrainian counterparts, the public discourse has focused on the diplomatic efforts. The U.S. has put 8,500 troops on higher alert for potential deployment to support and reassure NATO allies, and Austin and Milley said Friday that no U.S. forces have yet been deployed or moved around Europe. President Joe Biden, however, signaled a possible move soon. Returning to Washington after a trip Friday to Pennsylvania, Biden was asked if he had decided when he would move U.S. troops to eastern Europe. “I’ll be moving U.S. troops to eastern Europe and the NATO countries in the near term. Not a lot,” Biden said. Earlier this week Biden said he might move them in the nearer term, ”just because it takes time.” Austin and Milley said the U.S. has taken into account the risk that any troop movements could inflame the situation, but stressed the need for America to reassure its allies. Moving large units with heavy equipment and weapons often requires more time due to travel and logistical challenges. Milley painted a grim picture of Russian military capabilities around Ukraine, saying there are not only ground troops and naval and air forces but also cyber and electronic warfare capabilities, as well as special operations forces. He said the buildup is the largest he’s seen in recent memory, and he urged Putin to choose a diplomatic path over conflict. “If Russia chooses to invade Ukraine, it will not be cost-free, in terms of casualties and other significant effects,” Milley said. He was referring to Russian costs, while also noting that Ukraine’s armed forces are more capable today than in 2014, when Russia seized Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula and intervened in support of pro-Russian separatists in the eastern industrial heartland. Earlier Friday, the Kremlin said Putin told Macron that the West has failed to consider Russia’s key conditions of halting further NATO expansion, stopping the deployment of alliance weapons near Russian borders, and rolling back its forces from Eastern Europe. The U.S. and NATO formally rejected those demands this week, although Washington outlined areas where discussions are possible, offering hope that there could be a way to avoid war. Despite that, U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday warned Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy  that there is a “distinct possibility” that Russia could take military action against the former Soviet state in February. Russia has repeatedly denied having any such plans. Zelenskyy sought to play down the war fears, saying Western alarm over an imminent invasion has prompted many investors in the country’s financial markets to cash out. “We don’t need this panic,” he said at a news conference. “It cost Ukrainians dearly.” Putin told Macron that Moscow will study the U.S. and NATO response before deciding its next move, according to a Kremlin account of their call. The Russian president has made no public remarks about the Western response, but Lavrov said it leaves little chance for reaching agreement. “While they say they won’t change their positions, we won’t change ours,” Lavrov told Russian radio stations in a live interview. “I don’t see any room for compromise here.” “There won’t be a war as far as it depends on the Russian Federation, we don’t want a war,” he added. “But we won’t let our interests be rudely trampled on and ignored.” A senior Biden administration official said the U.S. welcomed Lavrov’s comments that Russia does not want war, “but this needs to be backed up with action. We need to see Russia pulling some of the troops that they have deployed away from the Ukrainian border and taking other de-escalatory steps.” The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk publicly. Lavrov said the U.S. suggested the two sides could talk about limits on the deployment of intermediate-range missiles, restrictions on military drills and rules to prevent accidents between warships and aircraft. He said the Russians proposed discussing those issues years ago, but Washington and its allies never took them up on it until now. He also said those issues are secondary to Russia’s main concerns about NATO. He said international agreements say the security of one nation must not come at the expense of others, and said he would send letters to ask his Western counterparts to explain their failure to respect that pledge. Washington has warned Moscow of devastating sanctions if it invades Ukraine, including penalties targeting top Russian officials and key economic sectors. Lavrov said Moscow had warned Washington that sanctions would amount to a complete severing of ties. NATO, meanwhile, said it was bolstering its deterrence in the Baltic Sea region. Russia has launched military drills involving motorized infantry and artillery units in southwestern Russia, warplanes in Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea, and dozens of warships in the Black Sea and the Arctic. Russian troops are also in Belarus for joint drills, raising Western fears that Moscow could stage an attack on Ukraine from the north. The Ukrainian capital is just 75 kilometers (50 miles) from the border with Belarus. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said there will be no war unless Belarus or Russia come under attack and he accused the West of trying to “drown our Slavic brotherhood in blood.” Despite the alarming rhetoric, Ukrainian officials have repeatedly tried to project calm. Zelenskyy said the decision by the U.S., Britain, Australia, Germany and Canada to withdraw some of their diplomats and dependents from Kyiv was a “mistake,” and said internal destabilization poses the greatest risk to his country. He also bemoaned NATO’s failure to offer Ukraine a roadmap to membership, saying the alliance should state clearly if it doesn’t plan to embrace Ukraine and not offer vague promises. Zelenskyy also challenged U.S. warnings of an imminent Russian attack, insisting “we aren’t seeing any escalation bigger than before.” He said the Russian buildup could be part of Moscow’s attempts to exert “psychological pressure” and sow panic. Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov told parliament the number of Russian troops near Ukraine — about 130,000 — is comparable to Moscow’s military buildup last spring, when Moscow eventually pulled its forces back after major exercises. ___ Karmanau reported from Kyiv, Ukraine, and Isachenkov reported from Moscow.

1056,apnews.com,2022-02-20 08:00:00,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-russia-united-states-europe-black-sea-a4e14d1b12c119c81d07dd3876cb057b,"Shelling in east Ukraine , Russia nuclear drill raise tension",English,United States,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia on Sunday rescinded earlier pledges to pull tens of thousands of its troops back from Ukraine’s northern border, a move that U.S. leaders said put Russia another step closer to what they said was the planned invasion of Ukraine. Residents of Ukraine’s capital filled a gold-domed cathedral to pray for peace. Russia’s action extends what it said were military exercises, originally set to end Sunday, that brought an estimated 30,000 Russian forces to Belarus, Ukraine’s neighbor to the north. They are among at least 150,000 Russian troops now deployed outside Ukraine’s borders, along with tanks, warplanes, artillery and other war materiel. The continued deployment of the Russian forces in Belarus raised concern that Russia could send those troops to sweep down on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, a city of about 3 million people less than a three-hour drive away. In what appeared to be a last-ditch diplomatic gambit brokered with the aid of French President Emmanuel Macron, the White House said U.S. President Joe Biden has agreed “in principle” to a meeting with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin as long as he holds off on launching an assault that U.S. officials warn appears increasingly more likely. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the administration has been clear that “we are committed to pursuing diplomacy until the moment an invasion begins.” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov are set to meet on Thursday in Europe — as long as Russia does not send its troops into Ukraine beforehand. “We are always ready for diplomacy. We are also ready to impose swift and severe consequences should Russia instead choose war,” Psaki said in statement. “And currently, Russia appears to be continuing preparations for a full-scale assault on Ukraine very soon.” In Kyiv, life outwardly continued as usual for many on a mild winter Sunday, with brunches and church services, ahead of what Biden said late last week was an already decided-upon Russian attack. Katerina Spanchak, who fled a region of eastern Ukraine when it was taken over by Russian-allied separatists, was among worshippers crowded into the capital’s St. Michael’s monastery, smoky with the candles burned by the faithful, to pray that Ukraine be spared. “We all love life, and we are all united by our love of life,” Spanchak said, pausing to compose herself. “We should appreciate it every day. That’s why I think everything will be fine.” “Our joint prayers will help to elude this tragedy, which is advancing,” said another worshipper, who identified himself only by his first name, Oleh. A U.S. official said Sunday that Biden’s assertion that Putin has made the decision to roll Russian forces into Ukraine was based on intelligence that Russian front-line commanders have been given orders to begin final preparations for an attack. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the sensitive intelligence. The United States and many European countries have charged for weeks that Putin has built up the forces he needs to invade Ukraine — a westward-looking democracy that has sought to move out of Russia’s orbit — and is now trying to create pretexts to invade. Western nations have threatened massive sanctions if Putin does. U.S. officials on Sunday defended their decision to hold off on their planned financial punishments of Russia ahead of any invasion, after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called passionately Saturday for the West to do more. “If you pull the trigger on that deterrent, well then, it doesn’t exist anymore as a deterrent,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told Fox on Washington’s sanctions threat. Russia held nuclear drills Saturday as well as the conventional exercises in Belarus, and has ongoing naval drills off the coast in the Black Sea. The announcement that Russia was reversing its pledge to withdraw its forces from Belarus came after two days of sustained shelling along a contact line between Ukraine’s soldiers and Russian-allied separatists in eastern Ukraine, an area that Ukraine and the West worry could be the flashpoint in igniting conflict. Biden convened the National Security Council at the White House on Russia’s military buildup around Ukraine. White House officials released no immediate details of their roughly two hours of discussion. “We’re talking about the potential for war in Europe,” U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris said earlier Sunday at a security conference in Munich, Germany, that saw urgent consultations among world leaders on the crisis. “It’s been over 70 years, and through those 70 years ... there has been peace and security.” Zelenskyy on Sunday appealed on Twitter for a cease-fire. Russia has denied plans to invade, but the Kremlin did not respond to Zelenskyy’s offer Saturday to meet with Putin. After a call with Macron, Putin blamed Ukraine — incorrectly, according to observers there — for the escalation of shelling along the contact line and NATO for “pumping modern weapons and ammunition” into Ukraine. Macron, a leader in European efforts to broker a peaceful resolution with Russia, also spoke separately to Zelenskyy, to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and to Biden. Blinken intentionally raised the prospect of a Biden-Putin summit in interviews with U.S. television networks on Sunday, in a bid to keep diplomacy alive, a senior U.S. official said. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss U.S. reasoning. Blinken said that Biden was “prepared to meet President Putin at any time in any format if that can help prevent a war” and the U.S. official said Macron had then conveyed the offer of talks to Putin — conditioned on Russia not invading — in his phone calls with the Russian leader. Tensions mounted further, however. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow issued an advisory urging greater caution by Americans in Russia overall. “Have evacuation plans that do not rely on U.S. government assistance,” it warned. Immediate worries focused on eastern Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces have been fighting the pro-Russia rebels since 2014 in a conflict that has killed some 14,000 people. In the eastern Ukraine regions of Lugansk and Donetsk, separatist leaders have ordered a full military mobilization and sent more civilians to Russia, which has issued about 700,000 passports to residents of the rebel-held territories. Claims that Russian citizens are being endangered might be used as justification for military action. Officials in the separatist territories claimed Ukrainian forces launched several artillery attacks over the past day and that two civilians were killed during an unsuccessful assault on a village near the Russian border. Ukraine’s military said two soldiers died in firing from the separatist side on Saturday. “When tension is escalated to the maximum, as it is now, for example, on the line of contact, then any spark, any unplanned incident or any minor planned provocation can lead to irreparable consequences,” Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said in an interview that aired Sunday on Russian state television. On the front lines, Ukrainian soldiers said they were under orders not to return fire. Zahar Leshushun, peering into the distance with a periscope, had followed the news all day from a trench where he is posted near the town of Zolote. “Right now, we don’t respond to their fire because ...” the soldier said before the sound of an incoming shell interrupted him. “Oh! They are shooting at us now. They are aiming at the command post.” ___ Heintz reported from Moscow and Miller from Washington.

Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, who led the Russian delegation at the security talks with the U.S. in Geneva last week, reaffirmed that Moscow has no intentions of invading Ukraine as the West fears, but said that receiving Western security guarantees is an imperative for Moscow. The talks in Geneva and a related NATO-Russia meeting in Brussels last week were held as Russia has amassed an estimated 100,000 troops near Ukraine in what the West fears might herald an invasion. Amid the soaring tensions, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Ukraine on Wednesday to reassure it of Western support in the face of what he called “relentless” Russian aggression. In Strasbourg, French President Emmanuel Macron urged the European Union to quickly draw up a new security plan containing proposals to help ease tensions with Russia. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Wednesday that talks between Blinken and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov set for Friday in Geneva are “extremely important.” In a move that further beefs up forces near Ukraine, Russia has sent an unspecified number of troops from the country’s far east to its ally Belarus, which shares a border with Ukraine, for major war games next month. Ukrainian officials have said that Moscow could use Belarusian territory to launch a potential multi-pronged invasion. The Russian Defense Ministry said Wednesday that some troops already have arrived in Belarus for the Allied Resolve 2022 drills that will run through Feb. 20. It said the exercise will be held at five firing ranges and other areas in Belarus and involve four Belarusian air bases. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Wednesday it’s too early to tell whether talks could defuse the crisis, adding that “after years of rising tensions, staying silent is not a sensible option.” “The Russian side is aware of our determination,” Scholz told the World Economic Forum. “I hope they also realize that the gains of cooperation outweigh the price of further confrontation.” Russia has denied that it intends to attack its neighbor but demanded guarantees from the West that NATO will not expand to Ukraine or other former Soviet nations or place its troops and weapons there. It also has urged NATO to roll back the deployments of its troops and weapons to Central and Eastern European nations that have joined the alliance after the end of the Cold War. Washington and its allies firmly rejected Moscow’s demands but kept the door open to possible further talks on arms control and confidence-building measures to reduce the potential for hostilities. Ryabkov insisted, however, that there can’t be any meaningful talks on those issues if the West doesn’t heed the main Russian requests for the non-expansion of NATO. He warned that the Russian demands “constitute a package, and we’re not prepared to divide it into different parts, to start processing some of those at expense of standing idle on others.” The Russian diplomat said Ukraine’s increasingly close ties with NATO allies pose a major security challenge to Russia. “We see the threat of Ukraine becoming ever more integrated in NATO without even acquiring a formal status of a NATO member state,” Ryabkov said, pointing at Western powers supplying Ukraine with weapons, training its troops and conducting joint drills. “This is something that goes right to the center of Russia’s national security interests, and we will do our utmost to reverse this situation.” Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 after mass protests prompted Ukraine’s Moscow-friendly leader to flee to Russia. At the same time, Russia also cast its support behind a separatist insurgency that swept over large areas in eastern Ukraine. More than 14,000 people have been killed in nearly eight years of fighting there. Asked if Russia could accept a moratorium on NATO’s expansion eastward, an idea circulated by some political experts, Ryabkov answered with a firm no, saying that Moscow has seen the West backtrack on previous promises. He emphasized that “for us, the matter of priority is achievement of watertight, bulletproof, legally binding guarantees” that Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations will not join the alliance. Ryabkov suggested that the U.S. could also take a unilateral obligation to never vote for NATO membership for Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations. Russia has urged the U.S. and NATO to provide a quick written response. Peskov told reporters Russia expects to receive it “within days.” ___ Matthew Lee in Kyiv, Ukraine and Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed to this report.",western,1,778,91.8,40.83,47.23,15.88,25.1,29.69,81.23,56.43,42.54,7.58,1.67,0.13,0.77,0,0.51,0.13,5.91,14.78,7.97,1.03,14.4,4.76,2.31,4.63,1.29,11.18,7.07,2.96,7.97,3.21,0.77,4.11,10.28,0.64,9.51,1.03,1.41,0.77,1.8,0.9,3.86,0,4.76,2.19,2.57,0.77,0.13,0.64,0.26,0.39,0,0,11.7,7.84,1.41,0.13,1.29,0,4.24,4.63,0,0.13,0,0.64,6.17,4.24,1.93,0,2.31,0.13,0.13,1.67,0.39,0,0.39,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.13,0.26,0.13,1.03,0.13,0,0,0.13,1.29,0.13,2.31,11.83,0.64,1.16,9.13,0.26,0.13,0.64,3.73,4.37,3.47,2.06,0,0,0,0,0,14.91,5.27,3.86,0,0,1.41,4.37

The European Union accuses Belarus of flying in thousands of people from the Middle East and pushing them to cross into EU and NATO members Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, in response to European sanctions. Minsk, which denies fomenting the crisis, cleared a migrant camp near the border on Thursday and started to repatriate some people to Iraq, while Poland and Lithuania reported lower numbers of attempts to cross their borders in recent days. But Morawiecki warned the crisis was far from over as he toured Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia on Sunday to discuss the situation. A poll published by Poland's Rzeczpospolita daily on Sunday said 55% of Poles are worried the crisis on the border could escalate into an armed conflict. ""I think that the things that unfold before our eyes, these dramatic events, may only be a prelude to something much worse,"" Morawiecki said in Vilnius. He pointed to increased Russian military presence close to Ukraine, as well as in Belarus and Russia's Kaliningrad enclave which borders Poland and Lithuania, as ""an instrument which could be used directly for a direct attack"". The situation in Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover ""may be used as the next stage of the migration crisis,"" said Morawiecki. Belarusian servicemen stand next to a barrier as migrants jostle to receive food outside the transport and logistics centre near the Belarusian-Polish border in the Grodno region, Belarus November 21, 2021. REUTERS/Kacper Pempel Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte warned European partners to not ignore Belarus' neighbours, after German Chancellor Angela Merkel twice called Lukashenko looking for solution of the humanitarian crisis. ""For us, it is very important that any talks (with Belarus) are coordinated with Lithuania, Poland and Latvia, which are at the forefront of the hybrid attack, and no decisions are taken which do not solve the situation fundamentally"", she said after meeting with Morawiecki on Sunday. France's foreign minister said on Sunday that Russia had to exert pressure on its ally, Belarus, to end the migrant crisis. Poland says Minsk continues to truck hundreds of foreigners to the frontier, where about 10 migrants are believed to have died with a frigid winter setting in. ""On Saturday ... a group of about 100 very aggressive foreigners, brought to the border by Belarusian servicemen, tried to enter Poland by force,"" the border guard said on Twitter on Sunday. A dozen migrants from Iraq, speaking with Lithuanian news portal DELFI over the border with Belarus on Saturday, said they were forcibly brought there in military trucks by Belarus officials, who ignored their wish to go back to Iraq. Hundreds of Poles took part in protests on Saturday to demand help for the migrants. The Catholic church organised a fundraiser on Sunday to collect money for those in need at the border and support the integration of refugees who will stay in Poland.

REUTERS/Shamil Zhumatov/File Photo MOSCOW, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Belarus wants Russian nuclear-capable Iskander missile systems to deploy them in the south and west of the country, President Alexander Lukashenko said in an interview with a Russian defence magazine published on Saturday. Russia is a close ally of Belarus, which the European Union has accused of engineering a crisis on its border by flying in thousands of migrants and pushing them to try to cross illegally into Poland. Brussels is gearing up to sanction Minsk. Lukashenko told the National Defence magazine that he needed the Iskander mobile ballistic missile system, which has a range of up to 500 kilometres and can carry either conventional or nuclear warheads. ""I need several divisions in the west and the south, let them stand (there),"" he said. EU members Poland and Lithuania lie to the west of Belarus. Its south borders Ukraine. Lukashenko gave no indication of whether he had held any talks with Moscow about receiving the missile system. Russia's Defence Ministry did not immediately reply to a request to comment. Belarus and Russia are formally part of a ""union state"" and have been in talks for years to move closer together.  read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

292,bbc.co.uk,2022-02-16 08:00:00,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-60401102,"Ukraine : united kingdom will judge Russia by its actions , says minister Ben Wallace",English,United Kingdom,"The UK will ""judge Russia by its actions"" after reports it is moving back troops from the border of Ukraine, says Defence Secretary Ben Wallace. He said the UK government would ""take them at their word"", but it was ""too soon to tell"" if the move was genuine. Russia's defence ministry claimed on Tuesday that it had withdrawn some troops conducting military exercises in districts bordering Ukraine. But Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky said the exit was not visible. Nato's secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, also said the alliance had not seen any evidence of a departure by Russian troops. Speaking ahead of a meeting of Nato member defence ministers, he said: ""So far we have not seen any de-escalation on the ground - on the contrary, it appears that Russia continues the military build-up."" Reports had suggested that US intelligence believed an invasion could be launched in the early hours of Wednesday. But while that has not happened, US President Joe Biden warned a Russian attack on Ukraine was ""still very much a possibility"", and the human cost would be ""immense"". After a call between UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Japanese counterpart Fumio Kishida, the leaders said any invasion would ""shake the foundations of the international order and have severe consequences"". The Ministry of Defence confirmed it was increasing British forces in Estonia, as well as sending additional Apache helicopters to the region, and sending four additional Typhoon jets for air patrols. The department said the increase would bring British troop numbers in the country to the high hundreds, but not thousands. Russia has long been opposed to the former Soviet republic of Ukraine growing closer to Europe and its institutions. President Vladimir Putin has demanded a guarantee from the West that Ukraine will not join Nato - a defensive alliance of 30 countries - but Nato has said it will not close down any future agreements. Russia has amassed more than 100,000 troops along Ukraine's border. President Putin insists Russia is not planning to invade, but the US and European countries - including the UK - have been providing support to Ukraine, such as training and weapons, and numerous governments have told their citizens to leave the country. Analysis by Paul Adams, BBC diplomatic correspondent Think of this crisis as theatre - actors move across the stage, soliloquies are delivered. There are ""sounds off"", ambiguous and open to interpretation. We are all mesmerised by Russia's troop movements, constantly asking ourselves what each set of pictures means. And that's what the director of this theatre, Vladimir Putin, intends. He wants to keep us guessing. It's perfectly possible that the sight of Russian armour, crossing the Kerch strait from Crimea, represents a hoped-for sign of de-escalation. But as Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg has reminded everyone, it's way too early to make any reliable judgement on what it all means. Vast numbers of Russian troops remain massed close to Ukraine's borders, arrayed in a fashion that western intelligence agencies can only interpret one way - this is an invasion force. That doesn't mean an invasion is coming. But even as the Kremlin denies it has any hostile intention, it suits President Putin for everyone to think that the stage is set for this drama's big battle scene. The UK has also pledged to impose tougher sanctions on Russia in the event of an invasion. But legislation to carry out the threat still needs to be approved by the British Parliament, which is currently in recess. The BBC understands MPs could be asked to sign off the plan early next week when they return to Westminster to send a message that the measures are ready and waiting. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for ""proper action"" on Russian cash and influence in the UK, adding: ""A failure to act now will only further strengthen Vladimir Putin in his attempts to stalk and menace his neighbours and democracies around the world."" Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Wallace said the UK was offering offering ""a range of forces - air, sea and land"" in support, with a doubling of troops in neighbouring Estonia and 1,000 more on standby if Nato calls on them. He said the troops would not be deployed if the situation between Russia and Ukraine de-escalated, but added it was ""important we make the plans so Russia knows we are serious about deterrence"". On reports Russia was moving back some of its troops from the border, Mr Wallace said: ""We will take them at their word, but judge them by their actions."" He added: ""I would be the first to be delighted by a de-escalation, we have all been working towards that, but we see 60% of Russia's land forces amassed on the Ukrainian and Belarus borders. ""I am an ex-soldier, that is not normal exercising, especially when you see the depth of deployments."" Earlier, the UK defence secretary told BBC Breakfast the build up of Russian troops on the ground had ""shown the opposite of the rhetoric coming out of the Kremlin"", but no-one knew what the country's leader was thinking. ""President Putin hasn't made a decision yet and, until a decision is made, none of us will know what will happen next."" But he said Russia ""hasn't got its way [as] Nato has not shut out people who wish to apply"". Countries in the West - including the UK - have threatened to introduce tough sanctions on Russia if they invade Ukraine. But what are the possible measures they could introduce? Banning Russia from Swift: The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or Swift, is an international banking transaction system. Russia is heavily reliant on Swift due to its multibillion exports of hydrocarbons traded in US dollars. Cutting the country off would terminate all international transactions, trigger currency volatility, and cause massive capital outflows. The US could also ban Russia from financial transactions involving US dollars - the world's reserve currency - meaning Russia would be extremely limited in what it could buy and sell around the world. Targeted export controls: The West could restrict the export of key commodities to Russia, such as goods containing American technology, like semiconductor microchips, which are used in everything from cars to smartphones. Energy restrictions and Nord Stream 2: Russia's economy is hugely dependent on selling gas and oil overseas. But the West could make it illegal for countries and companies to buy oil from the big Russian energy giants such as Gazprom or Rosneft. Europe could also put a halt to Nord Stream 2, a 759-mile proposed pipeline designed to transport gas from Russia to Germany. But Europe is already facing inflation and a cost of living crisis due to low supplies of gas. Target individuals: Not only associates of Vladimir Putin but the Russian president himself. A total of 185 Russian individuals, many of whom were involved in the annexation of the Crimea and the separatist movement in Eastern Ukraine, are already subject to sanctions, including asset freezes and travel bans. London clampdown: The British government has threatened to block Russian companies from raising capital in London and to expose property and company ownership. Sanctions could also be imposed to restrict the ability of Russian individuals to invest and live in London. According to the Office for National Statistics, Russian investment in the UK accounted for £25.5bn in 2016.",western,1,1223,84.32,54.69,27.35,18.31,23.08,29.11,81.11,61.16,47.34,7.36,3.27,0.16,1.14,0.08,0.82,0.9,4.09,12.84,8.26,1.47,13.98,7.69,2.78,6.3,1.39,14.8,6.13,3.84,7.77,2.7,0.57,4.5,11.53,0.74,10.71,2.04,1.47,1.96,1.64,0.25,3.6,0.08,2.45,1.14,1.31,0.16,0.08,0.08,0,0.08,0,0,11.04,4.74,0.33,0.33,0.74,0.25,2.45,6.38,0,0,0,1.06,4.82,2.7,1.72,0.41,4.25,0.25,0.16,2.53,1.72,0,0.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.08,0,0.25,0.16,0.49,0,0,0,0,0.57,0,3.84,9.48,0.08,1.39,7.52,0.57,0.08,0.08,2.86,4.01,4.17,1.31,0,0,0,0,0,16.03,4.33,4.58,0.08,0,1.47,5.56

Foreign Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta is currently out of the country but said in a statement that the ambassador was called in “to hear New Zealand’s strong opposition to the actions taken by Russia in recent days, and condemn what looks to be the beginning of a Russian invasion into Ukraine territory.” The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed to The Associated Press on Wednesday afternoon that the meeting had taken place but declined to provide any further details. ___ CANBERRA, Australia — Australia has announced additional sanctions on Russia and is warning businesses to prepare for retaliation through Russian cyberattacks. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Wednesday that targeted financial sanctions and travel bans will be a first batch of measures in response to Russian aggression toward Ukraine. Australia and Russia have imposed sanctions on each other since 2014. The sanctions were initiated by Australia in protest of Russian involvement in the Ukraine conflict. The National Security Committee of Morrison’s Cabinet approved sanctions and travel bans that target eight members of the Russian Security Council. They also agreed to expand previous sanctions and to align with the United States and Britain by targeting two Russian banks. ___ TOKYO — Japan’s prime minister has announced sanctions targeting Russia and two separatist Ukrainian regions recognized as independent by Russian President Vladimir Putin, joining an international effort seeking to pressure Russia to return to diplomatic solutions. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Wednesday that his government will ban new issuance and distribution of Russian government bonds in Japan in response to the “actions Russia has been taking in Ukraine.” He said Japan will also suspend visa issuance to the people linked to the two Ukrainian rebel regions and freeze their assets in Japan, and will ban trade with the two areas. Kishida repeated his “strong condemnation” of Russia for violating Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity as well as international law. He added: “We strongly urge Russia to return to diplomatic process in resolving the development.” ___ UNITED NATIONS -- The United Nations chief says the world is facing “the biggest global peace and security crisis in recent years” and is calling Russia’s declaration of the “so-called `independence’” of separatist areas in eastern Ukraine a violation of its territorial integrity and accusing Moscow of “the perversion of the concept of peacekeeping.” Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters Tuesday he is proud of the achievements of the U.N.’s far-flung peacekeepers, but when troops of one country enter the territory of another country without its consent, as Russian forces have done, “they are not impartial peacekeepers -- they are not peacekeepers at all” as Moscow has called them. Guterres said Russia’s unilateral actions also “conflict” with the U.N. Charter and are “a death blow to the Minsk Agreements” aimed at restoring peace to eastern Ukraine. ___ OTTAWA, Ontario — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Canada is sending hundreds more troops to eastern Europe and imposing new sanctions on Russia in response to the deployment of forces into Ukraine. The prime minister says up to 460 additional Canadian Armed Forces members are being sent to Latvia and the surrounding region to bolster NATO in the face of Russian aggression. He also says Canada is taking a number of steps alongside its allies to isolate Russia financially. ___ WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Antony Blinken says he has cancelled plans to meet his Russian counterpart in Geneva later this week as Russia presses ahead with recognition of separatist regions of Ukraine. Blinken told reporters on Tuesday that Russia’s actions indicated Moscow was not serious about a diplomatic path to resolving the crisis. As a result, he said he had called off his Thursday meeting with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Echoing President Joe Biden, Blinken said Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to recognize the independence of Ukraine’s Donbass region was a violation of international law. And, he said the placement of Russian troops there constituted the beginning of an invasion. Although he held out hope for a peaceful resolution through diplomacy, he said he did not believe a meeting with Lavrov would be productive at this time. ___ KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine’s president has called up some of the country’s military reservists as the threat of a Russian invasion grows, but says there is no need for a full military mobilization. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video address to the nation Tuesday night that he had signed a decree to that effect. “Today there is no need for a full mobilization. We need to quickly add additional staff to the Ukrainian army and other military formations,” Zelenskyy said. He said the decree only applies to those assigned to the so-called operational reserve, which is typically activated during ongoing hostilities, and covers “a special period of time,” without clarifying what that means. “Ukrainians are a peaceful nation, we want silence, but if we keep silent today, we will disappear tomorrow,” Zelenskyy said. There are about 250,000 troops in Ukraine’s armed forces. __ NEW YORK -- Stocks are closing lower on Wall Street after Russia sent forces into Ukraine’s eastern regions, escalating tensions. The benchmark S&P 500 index fell 1% to 4,304.76 on Tuesday, and is now more than 10% below it’s all-time high set in January. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq also lost more than 1%. Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized the independence of rebel-held regions of Ukraine, raising fears of an imminent full-scale invasion. The U.S. and European Union responded with sanctions. Technology shares also weighed on the broader market. Bond yields rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 1.93%. —- WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden says the U.S. will be sanctioning Russian oligarchs and their families, as well as Russian sovereign debt in retaliation for the country’s invasion of Ukraine. Speaking at the White House on Tuesday, Biden said those sanctions were just the “first tranche” of what the U.S. and its allies stand ready to put in place if Russia launches a larger invasion of Ukraine. “He’s setting up a rationale to take more territory by force,” Biden said of recent comments by Russian President Vladimir Putin. “This is the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.” Biden added that he was authorizing the movement of some U.S. troops in Europe to NATO’s Baltic allies as a show of support and solidarity amid the Russian threat. ___ BERLIN — Germany’s Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has chaired a call of the G-7 nations in which ministers strongly condemned Russia’s recognition of the separatist-controlled areas of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine and the decision to deploy Russian troops there. Those involved included the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S., along with the European Union. The German foreign ministry said Tuesday night that the G-7 foreign ministers agreed to step up restrictive measures responding to Russia’s actions and reiterated their unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders. ___ BERLIN — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz says Germany continues to rule out the delivery of arms to Ukraine despite Russian President Vladimir Putin’s order to deploy troops to separatist regions of eastern Ukraine. Scholz told German public broadcaster ARD on Tuesday night that Germany had made a decision to not export weapons to crisis regions a long time ago, “and we stick to that.” Scholz also pointed out that “Ukraine has a lot of weapons ... and the point is that we have to protect Ukraine not by giving more weapons, but by standing together as an international community and saying that we will not simply accept such a breach of international law.” He stressed that Germany has been the biggest financial supporter of Ukraine since 2014. The chancellor added “we must insist that the peace order in Europe is again based on the fact that borders are not moved and that the state sovereignty of countries is not questioned.” ___ BERLIN — Protesters have flocked to the Russian embassy in Berlin to decry Russian President Vladimir Putin’s order to deploy troops to separatist regions of eastern Ukraine. People were waving yellow-blue Ukrainian flags and chanting “We stand united with Ukraine!” as they assembled in front of the building near the German capital’s landmark Brandenburg Gate on Tuesday evening. Some held up banners saying “Ukraine will resist,” “Say no to Putin” or “Implement sanctions immediately,” while others wrapped themselves into huge Ukrainian flags. “I’m here to protest against Russia invading our independent Ukrainian territory,” said Victoria Baron, 27, who moved from Odesa in Ukraine to Berlin last summer to work for a data science company. “It’s very important that we support our people even though we’re abroad,” she said adding that she talked to her family back home almost every day and spends hours on social media following the latest developments. ___ CAIRO -- The interim government in chaos-stricken Libya says it rejects Russia’s decision to recognize two separatist regions in southeast Ukraine. In a statement Tuesday, the Government of National Unity has urged Russia to de-escalated and resort to diplomacy to find a solution to the Ukraine crisis. It also called for Russia to withdraw Wagner mercenaries from Libya that fought along with forces of military commander Khalifa Hifter when he unsuccessfully attempted in 2019 to capture the capital of Tripoli.. ___ MOSCOW — The Russian Foreign Ministry said that it has decided to evacuate Russian diplomatic personnel from Ukraine, pointing at threats. The ministry said Tuesday that Russian diplomats in Ukraine have received multiple threats, adding that they will be evacuated “in the nearest time.” It did not elaborate. The move follows Russia’s recognition of Ukraine’s rebel regions and the Russian parliament’s vote to grant President Vladimir Putin a permission to use military force in Ukraine. The Ukrainian capital of Kyiv is only a three hour drive from the border of Belarus, where Russia has stationed troops for earlier war games. ___ BRUSSELS — French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian says the European Union’s 27 members have unanimously agreed on an initial set of sanctions targeting Russian officials involved in Ukraine. EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said Tuesday this first package of sanctions “will hurt Russia and it will hurt a lot.” He said the sanctions would affect members of Russia’s duma who voted against the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine as well as another 27 people and “entities” which are often companies, banks or agencies. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said sanctions will directly target individuals and companies, as well as banks financing “the Russian military apparatus” and contributing to the destabilization of Ukraine. In addition, von der Leyen said the EU will limit the Russian government’s ability to raise capital on the bloc’s financial markets. “We will make it as difficult as possible for the Kremlin to pursue its aggressive actions,” she said. __ BERLIN — Germany’s top security official says authorities are preparing for possible cyberattacks in response to the crisis with Russia. The Interior Ministry said Tuesday that security agencies have taken protective measures to avert such attacks and Germany’s national cyber defense center is monitoring developments. Interior Minister Nancy Faser said on Twitter that authorities “are prepared for all conceivable impacts of this conflict.” ___ BUCHAREST, Romania — Romanian President Klaus Iohannis said Tuesday after a phone call with his Polish counterpart that they have agreed to hold an “extraordinary summit” Friday in Warsaw between the Bucharest Nine members to “coordinate our response and demonstrate our unity” amid Russia’s moves against Ukraine. “Today I discussed with the President of Poland, Andrzej Duda, the serious security situation in the Black Sea region, following Russian actions, which flagrantly violates international law,” Iohannis wrote online. “We stand with Ukraine!” The Bucharest Nine, which Romania and Poland launched in 2015, is a group comprised of NATO’s easternmost members and also includes Hungary, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. ___ BELVOIR CASTLE, England — Defense ministers from the Baltic states urged world leaders to move swiftly and impose harsh sanctions on Russia, saying their countries know firsthand the dangers of trying to appease a bully. The Baltic countries’ position on NATO’s eastern flank was at the forefront of discussions Tuesday as defense ministers from the Joint Expeditionary Force met in central England. The U.K.-led force is a group of 10 nations designed to react more quickly in the event of threats like those now posed by Russia. Latvian Defense Minister Artis Pabriks said in an interview with the Associated Press that world leaders must act swiftly to impose punishing sanctions or it will be too late to stand up for freedom and democracy. He said failure to stop the Russian president’s “aggression” now would send the message that Moscow can “play around with the Europeans” and the U.S. ___ LONDON — Sanctions experts say Western measures against Russia will have to go much further to have a chance of deterring President Vladimir Putin from further military intervention in Ukraine. Tyler Kustra, a University of Nottingham politics professor, said sanctions announced Tuesday by Britain on five Russian banks and three wealthy individuals were “a paper cut.” He said “the U.K. could be doing a lot more. There are certainly far more oil oligarchs in London that could be sanctioned. They could have their assets frozen, they could be kicked out of the country.” Thomas Mayne, a corruption expert and visiting fellow at the Chatham House think-tank, also said Britain’s status as a hub for no-questions-asked Russian money was a major problem. “For at least 20 years, we’ve been welcoming Russian money,” he said. “We’ve been allowing people with very dubious sources of wealth to gain Tier 1 investor visas in the U.K., to buy property, to list their companies on the London Stock Exchange, far more so than American stock exchanges. And we’ve created a situation where now we’re wondering whether that was such a good idea.” —— MOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for international recognition of Crimea as part of Russia, an end to Ukraine’s NATO membership bid and a halt to weapons shipments there. Putin claimed Tuesday that Russia’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula should be internationally recognized as a legitimate reflection of the local population’s choice, likening it to a vote for Kosovo independence. The annexation has been widely condemned by Western powers as a breach of international law. To end the current crisis, he also called for the renunciation of Ukraine’s NATO bid, saying it should assume a “neutral status,” and said that the West should stop sending weapons there. ——- BRUSSELS — NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg says Russia is taking military action against Ukraine and has condemned Moscow’s decision to recognize separatist areas of southeast Ukraine as independent. Stoltenberg called the move Tuesday a “serious escalation by Russia and a flagrant violation of international law.” The NATO chief called the military action a “further invasion” of Ukraine by Russia which had already invaded its neighbor in 2014. He added that there’s “every indication” Russia continues to plan for a full-scale attack on Ukraine. Stoltenberg said that NATO allies have more than 100 warplanes on high alert and more than 120 warships ready at sea from the Arctic Circle to the Mediterranean Sea. He said that the NATO response force remains on high readiness but is not yet being deployed, although some allies are moving troops, ships and planes into the Baltic states and near the Black Sea to defend other NATO members. ___ MOSCOW — Russian lawmakers have given President Vladimir Putin permission to use military force outside the country. The unanimous vote in Russia’s upper house on Tuesday could presage a broader attack on Ukraine after the U.S. said an invasion was already underway there. The vote formalizes a Russian military deployment to the rebel regions, where an eight-year conflict has killed nearly 14,000 people. ___ MOSCOW — Russia’s closest allies appeared reluctant to immediately back Moscow’s decision to recognize the independence of rebel-held areas in eastern Ukraine. The Foreign Ministry of Belarus said Tuesday it saw Russian President Vladimir Putin’s move “with respect and understanding,” but refrained from saying whether Minsk would follow suit and recognize the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk republics. Officials in Kazakhstan, whose president last month asked for a Russia-led security alliance to send troops to quell violent unrest, said the issue of recognizing the separatist regions was not on the country’s agenda. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, who’s in Moscow for talks with Putin, made no mention of Moscow’s recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk in his publicly broadcast remarks, but focused instead on bilateral relations. Another Russian ally, Armenia, has so far issued no message of support for the Russian move. Meanwhile, Putin sought to reassure Russia’s ex-Soviet allies that he doesn’t envision resurrecting the Soviet Union. He told the Azerbaijani president that speculation that Russia would attempt to restore its empire “is absolutely not true.” ___ WASHINGTON — The White House has begun referring to Russian troop deployments in eastern Ukraine as an “invasion” after initially hesitating to use the term — a red line that President Joe Biden has said would result in the U.S. levying severe sanctions against Moscow. Jon Finer, the principal deputy national security adviser, said Tuesday: “We think this is, yes, the beginning of an invasion, Russia’s latest invasion into Ukraine.” He said “latest” was important — “an invasion is an invasion and that is what is under way.” The White House decided to begin referring to Russia’s actions as an “invasion” because of the situation on the ground, according to a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The administration resisted initially calling the deployment of troops because the White House wanted to see what Russia was actually going to do. The official added that, after assessing Russian troop movements, it became clear it was a new invasion. — By Aamer Madhani in Washington. —— LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson says Britain is slapping sanctions on five Russian banks and three wealthy individuals over Russia’s latest military moves on Ukraine. Johnson told lawmakers that sanctions would hit Rossiya Bank, IS Bank, General Bank, Promsvyazbank and the Black Sea Bank. He said three Russian oligarchs with interests in energy and infrastructure -- Gennady Timchenko, Boris Rotenberg and Igor Rotenberg -- will have their assets frozen and be banned from traveling to the U.K. All three have already been sanctioned by the United States. Johnson accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of “establishing the pretext for a full-scale offensive” against Ukraine and said “further powerful sanctions” would follow if that happened. “This the first tranche, the first barrage of what we are prepared to do and we hold further sanctions at readiness to be deployed,” Johnson told British lawmakers. He also said Russian tanks and armored personnel carriers have been spotted in the separatist Ukrainian regions recognized as independent by Putin. He said that amounts to “a renewed invasion” of Ukraine. —— BERLIN — Chancellor Olaf Scholz says Germany has taken steps to halt the process of certifying the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia. Scholz told reporters in Berlin on Tuesday that his government was taking the measure in response to Moscow’s actions in Ukraine. The pipeline bringing natural gas from Russia to Germany has long been criticized by the United States and some European countries who argue that it increases Europe’s reliance on Russian energy supplies. Scholz said that the government had decided to “reassess” the certification of the pipeline, which hasn’t begun operating yet. “That will certainly take time, if I may say so,” he said. —— MOSCOW — Russia says its recognition of independence for areas in eastern Ukraine extends to territory currently held by Ukrainian forces. The statement Tuesday further raises the stakes amid Western fears that Moscow could follow up on Monday’s recognition of rebel regions with a full-fledged invasion of Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia has recognized the rebel regions’ independence “in borders that existed when they proclaimed” their independence in 2014. Ukrainian forces later reclaimed control of large part of both regions during a nearly eight-year conflict that has killed over 14,000 people. —— Follow AP’s coverage of the Ukraine crisis at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",western,1,3387,93.52,59.38,28.91,14.71,23.69,33.95,79.07,54.77,41.9,6.2,3.04,0.09,0.74,0.21,1.24,0.56,3.16,12.58,7.79,1.56,15.15,5.46,2.51,4.72,0.59,12.28,5.46,2.86,9.06,2.04,0.62,6.47,7.91,0.32,7.47,1.56,1.48,0.86,0.74,0.18,2.63,0,3.51,1.51,2.01,0.5,0.09,0.41,0.09,0.24,0,0,12.11,6.58,0.47,0.21,1.06,0.12,4.13,5.61,0.03,0.03,0.12,1.18,8.03,5.55,2.21,0.27,2.42,0.06,0.21,1.62,0.92,0.03,0.21,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.09,0.5,0.09,0.47,0,0.06,0,0.03,0.92,0.12,2.86,10.01,0.3,1.06,8.12,0.44,0.12,0.09,3.69,4.99,3.28,1.12,0.44,0.38,0.21,0,0,17.69,5.14,3.4,0,0.06,2.18,6.91

Then two words - “nuclear energy” - intervened. Heading into the Christmas week, atomic power is a topic on which France and Germany broadly differ, and one that has become a big thorn in the side of the EU as the 27-nation bloc decides whether to include nuclear-generated energy among the economic activities that qualify for sustainable investment. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who took office last week, and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed on most of the issues tackled during Thursday’s summit, including Ukraine-Russia tensions and an immigration dispute with Belarus. On the the sustainable investment rules, however, the two leaders have yet to reach a compromise. The rift over nuclear energy was enough to scuttle any agreement on energy prices during the summit. A big rise in energy prices has reignited the debate about whether the EU should promote nuclear power projects as a way of becoming greener and more energy independent. France has asked for nuclear power to be included in the so-called “taxonomy” by the end of the year, leading the charge with several other EU countries that operate nuclear power plants. The group initially faced strong opposition from Germany and other members that wanted nuclear power to be ineligible for green financing, but Scholz adopted a peacebuilding tone in the summit’s final hours early Friday. “We are talking about countries with different business models. It’s important that each EU country can pursue its own approach without Europe becoming disunited,” Scholz said. “At the end of the day, we will have to come together despite the different priorities we may have set.” Germany’s remaining nuclear power plants are due to go offline next year. France derives about 70% of its electricity from nuclear energy. Last month, Macron announced that France will start building its first new nuclear reactors in decades. Unveiling the plans, he said the the new reactors will help guarantee France’s energy independence and help reach carbon neutrality in 2050. “It’s not a Franco-German discussion,” Macron said during the press conference. “There are different energy models in different European countries. What we want to achieve is agree on a taxonomy that allows us to continue with our industrial policy and to be coherent in decarbonizing our economies.” Two years ago, EU leaders agreed that nuclear could be part of the bloc’s solution to making its economy carbon neutral by 2050. Leaving the possibility of using nuclear energy in their national energy mixes reassured the bloc’s coal-reliant countries, which are expected to suffer the most during the transition. However, making future nuclear power projects eligible for billions in euros available as part of the European Green Deal while avoiding “greenwashing” remains a controversial issue. Countries that want nuclear power to remain ineligble for green financing often cite the EU’s guidance that all investments financed by the pandemic recovery fund should not harm the bloc’s environmental goals. “The lack of agreement shows how lively this is, not only in our country, but throughout Europe,” Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo, who faces a domestic crisis over how to phase out nuclear plants and still maintain energy security to his citizens. De Croo suggested that amid the energy price crunch, nuclear energy and gas could be temporarily eligible for funds. “You have to be able to look sufficiently ahead, and if you do so you can assume that technologies like nuclear and gas can be useful technologies in the medium term to bridge the gap until we have fully sustainable energy,” De Croo said early Friday. The ball is now with the EU’s chief, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. She is expected to present before the end of the year the list of activities eligible for the green investment funds and must decide whether nuclear energy and natural gas make the cut. Von der Leyen has been under pressure from environmental groups and Green European lawmakers to resist the inclusion of both. “Fossil gas and nuclear power have no place in the EU taxonomy” for sustainable activities, said Sven Giegold, a Green lawmaker in the European Parliament. A low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels, nuclear energy represented around 26% of the electricity produced in the bloc in 2019, with 13 EU countries endowed with operational reactors. ___ Follow all AP stories about climate change at https://apnews.com/hub/climate.",western,1,759,95.38,47.08,32.89,29.07,23.72,27.4,77.87,57.97,43.08,5.27,2.37,0,1.19,0.4,0.4,0.13,2.9,15.02,9.35,1.84,14.76,5.67,2.77,4.22,0.53,10.67,8.83,4.35,9.09,1.98,1.05,6.19,9.09,0.4,8.7,1.05,1.05,1.71,1.05,0.26,3.56,0,3.03,1.84,1.19,0.4,0.13,0.26,0,0,0,0,7.64,3.43,0.53,0,0.4,0.13,1.71,3.69,0,0,0.13,0.26,6.32,2.11,1.05,3.16,4.61,0,0,2.77,2.37,0.13,0.4,0.26,0.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.79,0.4,0.13,0.13,0.4,0,0.13,0.53,0,3.43,7.38,0.13,1.45,5.4,1.05,0,0.13,6.32,1.84,2.64,1.84,0.26,0.13,0.13,0,0,15.15,4.35,3.95,0,0,1.71,5.14

US , Russia harden stances in talks",English,United States,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The failure of last week’s high-stakes diplomatic meetings to resolve escalating tensions over Ukraine has put Russia, the United States and its European allies in uncharted post-Cold War territory, posing significant challenges for the main players to avoid an outright and potentially disastrous confrontation. Unlike previous disagreements that have arisen since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the current Ukraine crisis and seemingly insurmountable differences between Washington and Moscow carry real risks of debilitating economic warfare and military conflict that are exacerbated by the dangers of miscalculation and overreaction. For the U.S. and its NATO and other European allies, nothing less than a vast pullback of the roughly 100,000 Russian troops now deployed near the Ukrainian border will prove that Russian President Vladimir Putin has any intention of negotiating in good faith. For the Russians, the West’s absolute refusal to consider a ban on NATO expansion and the withdrawal of troops from Eastern Europe is proof of its perfidy. Potential concessions are complicated by the fact neither Putin nor President Joe Biden wants to be seen as backing down before either domestic or foreign audiences. The refusal thus far by each side to climb down from what the other regards as unrealistic and maximalist demands has left the prospects for diplomacy in limbo, with the U.S. and its allies accusing Russia of stoking tensions for no legitimate reason and the Russians complaining again that the Americans are the aggressors. Some believe the situation will have to become even more dire before the impasse can be broken. “The gap in perceptions is so broad that a new and dangerous escalation could be necessary to make the parties open up their imagination and search for agreements,” Fyodor Lukyanov, the head of the Moscow-based Council for Foreign and Defense Policies, observed in a commentary. For Western analysts, it seems a situation in which Putin will have to compromise if conflict is to be avoided. Some think Putin’s focus on NATO, which has struggled for years with questions about its relevance, may have given the alliance a new lease on life. “This is an extremely uncertain and tense period without an obvious way out unless Putin backs down,” said Jeff Rathke, a Europe expert and former U.S. diplomat who is currently president of the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies at Johns Hopkins University. “He’s talked himself into a frenzy that is hard to walk away from if he doesn’t get the fundamental redrawing of the European security architecture that he claims to want. He’s shown he’s ready to play chicken with the threat of massive military force to bring that about and he’s certainly gotten everyone’s attention, but he hasn’t changed anyone’s views,” Rathke said. U.S. officials from Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan to chief negotiator Wendy Sherman have said it is Russia that faces a “stark choice.” De-escalate or face punishing sanctions and the opposite of what it wants: an increased NATO presence in Eastern Europe and a more well-armed Ukraine. Yet in Russia, officials say the shoe is on the other foot. They have cast their demands as an “absolute imperative” and have argued that the Western failure to meet them makes talks on other issues irrelevant. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the U.S. and Russia reached “some understandings” during last week’s talks. “But in general, in principle, we can now say that we are staying on different tracks, on totally different tracks, and this is not good, and this is disturbing,” he said in an interview on CNN’s “Fareed Zakaria GPS” to be broadcast on Sunday. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Friday that Russia had vainly tried for years to persuade the U.S. and its allies to engage in talks on the non-deployment of intermediate-range missiles to Europe, limits on war games and rules to avoid dangerously close encounters between Russian and allied warships and aircraft until the U.S. and NATO expressed willingness to discuss those issues this week. He attributed the change in approach to a U.S. desire to shift attention away from Russia’s main demands, adding that Moscow will focus on NATO non-expansion. And he insisted that it’s the U.S. that’s formulating the position in talks while other allies just march on its orders. “To be frank, everyone understands that the prospect for reaching a deal depends on the U.S.,” Lavrov said. He said whatever the U.S. says about the need to consult allies in negotiations “are just excuses and attempts to drag the process out.” Thus, the stalemate. The West’s approach has been to have “as much diplomatic effort as possible to de-escalate,” said Andrew Weiss, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, where he oversees research in Washington and Moscow on Russia and Eurasia. “The problem we’ve got is that the Russians mean business, and they’ve shown us in a bunch of cases, in 2014, in 2008, that they’re prepared to go to war to get these things, and we’re not,” he said. “And that’s the challenge.” The tough and uncompromising Russian positions have led some to believe that Moscow will only up the ante after receiving what all sides expect will be formal, written refusals from the U.S. and NATO to accede to its demands. Indeed, the chief Russian negotiator in the talks, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, suggested Thursday that Moscow might respond to rejections by escalating matters outside of Europe through the potential deployment of troops to Cuba and Venezuela. The U.S. has called such a suggestion “bluster” and said it would respond decisively if it happened. “The lack of a diplomatic solution logically leads to the further exacerbation of the crisis,” wrote Dmitri Trenin, the head of the Carnegie Moscow Center, in an online analysis. Trenin predicted that a set of “military-technical measures” that Putin said Russia would take if the West rejects its demands could include “a broad array of moves ... from the deployment of new weapons systems in various regions to much stronger military ties with Belarus and a closer coordination with the Chinese partners.” Still, there’s a risk that by focusing his ire on NATO, Putin may have inadvertently strengthened its hand, especially with its newer members like the Baltic states, Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic. “For countries that have joined NATO since the Cold War, you can definitely say that NATO is more relevant to them now than it was a year ago or in 2014,” Rathke said. “Anyone who thought that NATO was no longer relevant to European security has been taught a lesson in the last few months. And it’s only going to get worse.” ___ Isachenkov reported from Moscow.

611,apnews.com,2022-01-27 08:00:00,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-russia-europe-united-states-e6817878cada4a2abf472e1e1e184bf5,Ukraine crisis updates : What to know today,English,United States,"WARSAW, Poland (AP) — The United States and NATO have made no concessions to the main Russian demands to resolve the crisis over Ukraine, including giving Moscow a guarantee that its western neighbor can never join the alliance. The focus is now on how Russia will respond — a decision that rests squarely with President Vladimir Putin and one that could determine whether Europe will again be plunged into war. Here are things to know on Thursday about the international tensions surrounding Ukraine. ___ HOW HAS RUSSIA RESPONDED? Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that the response from the U.S. — and a similar one from NATO — leaves “little ground for optimism.” But he added that “there always are prospects for continuing a dialogue, it’s in the interests of both us and the Americans.” Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov noted that the U.S. response contains some elements that could lead to “the start of a serious talk on secondary issues.” But Lavrov emphasized that “the document contains no positive response on the main issue,” the Russian demands for the non-expansion of NATO and the non-deployment of weapons that Russia views as a threat. ___ WHAT IS UKRAINE SAYING? Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Kyiv saw the U.S. response before it was delivered on Wednesday to Russia, and had no objections. He tweeted that it’s “important that the U.S. remains in close contact with Ukraine before and after all contacts with Russia. No decisions on Ukraine without Ukraine.” Kuleba also emphasized his country’s need to strengthen its defenses, speaking Thursday on a visit to Denmark. He said Ukraine appreciates all the support it gets, but that the times call for hard power to be prioritized over soft power, citing the importance of weapons, economic sanctions and a consolidated position of Ukraine’s allies. ___ RUSSIA HOPES FOR CHANGE IN KYIV A top Putin associate, former President and ex-Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, says he hopes Ukraine will choose leaders who want “normal” ties with Russia. Medvedev, a deputy head of Russia’s Security Council, said a Russia-NATO conflict “would be the most dramatic and simply catastrophic scenario, and I hope it will never happen.” Medvedev argued that Moscow sees no point in talking to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but voiced hope that the Ukrainians would eventually become “weary of that bedlam and elect the leadership that would pursue policies ... aimed at normal economic relations with Russia.” Medvedev’s comment follows a British claim that the Kremlin is seeking to replace Ukraine’s government with a pro-Moscow administration — an allegation Russia denies. __ WHAT U.S. MILITARY TROOPS ARE ON ALERT? The U.S. Defense Department says troops from at least 10 bases across the country have been put on higher alert for possible deployment to Europe in the ongoing Ukraine crisis, including Army units from the 82nd Airborne, 101st Airborne and 4th Infantry Divisions. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said the department won’t disclose the specific units. But the bases include Army combat strongholds and key Air Force locations, including Robins Air Force Base in Georgia, which houses a major logistics complex, and Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona, where A-10 Thunderbolt close air support aircraft are based. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has put 8,500 troops in the United States on alert for possible deployment to NATO allies in Europe, mainly as part of a NATO response force to deter any wider Russian aggression against Ukraine. The Pentagon has stressed that none of the troops would deploy into Ukraine, and no forces have gotten deployment orders yet. The units will come from the following Army bases: Fort Bragg, North Carolina; Fort Campbell, Kentucky; Fort Carson, Colorado; Fort Hood, Texas; and Fort Stewart, Georgia. The Air Force bases are Davis-Monthan, Robins and Wright-Patterson in Ohio, along with Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington, which houses Army and Air Force units. U.S. troops based in Europe also may be shifted around to other countries as needed. __ WHAT DO REGULAR UKRAINIANS SAY? Ukrainians have joined a campaign on social networks under the hashtag #UkrainiansWillResist amid fears that Russia’s troop buildup near the border heralds plans of an invasion. Hundreds of Ukrainians at home and abroad have posted the hashtag and have put a Ukrainian flag on their profile pictures. They include celebrities, journalists, activists and politicians, with the campaign growing more popular by the day. “Nobody can force Ukrainians to accept Putin’s ultimatum. There will not be any ‘peace’ on Russia’s conditions,” Andrii Levus, the campaign initiator, wrote on his Facebook page. He added: “Even if West will make a deal with Putin over Ukraine and Zelenskyy will capitulate, #UkrainiansWillResist to Russian to occupiers. Welcome to hell, Mr. Putin!” —— BIDEN TELLS ZELENSKYY RUSSIA COULD INVADE IN EARLY FEBRUARY President Joe Biden warned Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday that there is a “distinct possibility” that the Russians could invade Ukraine in February, according to White House National Security Council spokesperson Emily Horne. The exchange happened in a call between the two leaders that was described by the White House as a “check in” to discuss the latest diplomatic efforts. “He has said this publicly and we have been warning about this for months,” Horne said of Biden’s latest comments about rising U.S. concern of a further invasion by Russia of Ukraine. Biden warned Zelenskyy that the U.S. believed there was a high degree of likelihood that Russia could invade when the ground freezes and Russian forces could attack Ukrainian territory from north of Kyiv, according to two people familiar with the conversation who were not authorized to comment and spoke on the condition of anonymity. Military experts have said Russia may be waiting for optimal ground conditions to move heavy equipment into Kyiv as part of any invasion. Eight years ago, Russia invaded Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in late February. The White House said in a separate statement that Biden also “reaffirmed the readiness” of the U.S. and allies “to respond decisively” if Russia further invades Ukrainian territory. Zelenskyy said on Twitter following the call that he and Biden also discussed possibilities “for financial support to Ukraine” and that he thanked Biden for U.S. military assistance. It was the third call between the two leaders since last month. The White House confirmed that Biden told Zelenskyy he was “exploring additional macroeconomic support to help Ukraine’s economy” as it comes under pressure as a result of the Russian military buildup along its borders. ___ WHAT’S THE UNITED NATIONS DOING? The U.N. Security Council will hold an open meeting Monday on what U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield called “Russia’s threatening behavior against Ukraine and the build-up of Russian troops on Ukraine’s borders and in Belarus.” She said Thursday that the deployment of more than 100,000 troops on the Ukrainian border and other destabilizing acts aimed at the country pose “a clear threat to international peace and security and the U.N. Charter.” Thomas-Greenfield said Security Council members “must squarely examine the facts and consider what is at stake for Ukraine, for Russia, for Europe, and for the core obligations and principles of the international order should Russia further invade Ukraine.” “This is not a moment to wait and see,” she said in a statement. “The council’s full attention is needed now, and we look forward to direct and purposeful discussion on Monday.” Norway holds the presidency of the council in January and Monday is its last day presiding over the U.N.’s most powerful body. Russia takes over the presidency for the month of February on Tuesday. The council president has some control over its agenda. ___ BIDEN TO MEET GERMANY’S NEW LEADER The White House announced that President Joe Biden and new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will discuss Russian aggression toward Ukraine during a meeting next month in Washington. The one-on-one meeting will be Scholz’s first Oval Office meeting since he took over leadership of his country in December. Germany’s refusal to join the U.S. and other NATO members in providing weapons to Ukraine has annoyed some allies and raised questions about Berlin’s resolve in standing up to Russia. Experts say Germany’s position is partly rooted in its history of aggression during the 20th century. ___ WHAT’S GERMANY’S STANCE? German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said her government is closely coordinating its policy with its allies, and the range of options Berlin will consider in the event of renewed Russian aggression includes action against the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. The pipeline, which hasn’t begun operation yet, was built to pump natural gas from Russia to Germany, but Berlin has gradually backed away from the project amid growing tensions with Moscow. Baerbock said Thursday that while Germany has refused to supply weapons to Ukraine, it will continue to provide economic support to Kyiv. “A (soccer) team doesn’t need 11 center forwards who all do the same thing, but 11 players who get along well and have a common game plan in mind,” she told lawmakers. ___ FRANCE TAKES ITS OWN PATH French President Emmanuel Macron continues to push for dialogue with Russia despite signs pointing to a potential war, convinced that diplomacy can still avert conflict. Macron is preparing to talk Friday with Putin, and Macron’s presidential palace hosted marathon talks Wednesday between Russian and Ukrainian advisers, the first such face-to-face negotiations since Russia massed troops near Ukraine in recent weeks. Macron’s stance reflects France’s post-World War II tradition of carving its own geopolitical path, refusing to line up blindly behind the U.S. But France’s diplomacy-focused strategy complicates efforts by the U.S. and NATO to show a tough, united front against Russia. Experts question whether it will be enough to deter a Russian invasion. ___ WHAT ABOUT NATO MEMBER TURKEY? Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says an armed attack on Ukraine by Russia wouldn’t be a “rational” move, and is offering to mediate between the two countries. “I hope that Russia will not resort to armed attack and occupation of Ukraine,” Erdogan told Turkey’s NTV television late Wednesday. “Such a step would not be a rational move for Russia or for our region.” A statement Thursday at the end of a National Security Council meeting chaired by Erdogan said an “escalation of tensions would not be to anyone’s benefit.” ___ Yuras Karmanau in Kyiv, Ukraine, Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow, Frank Jordans in Berlin, Sylvie Corbet in Paris, Suzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey, Jan M.

610,apnews.com,2022-01-26 08:00:00,https://apnews.com/72856781c3b92640d03c5e954488ba90,Russia threatens retaliation if Ukraine demands not met,English,United States,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration and NATO told Russia on Wednesday there will be no U.S. or NATO concessions on Moscow’s main demands to resolve the crisis over Ukraine. In separate written responses delivered to the Russians, the U.S. and NATO held firm to the alliance’s open-door policy for membership, rejected a demand to permanently ban Ukraine from joining, and said allied deployments of troops and military equipment in Eastern Europe are nonnegotiable. “There is no change, there will be no change,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. Also not up for negotiation will be the U.S. and European response to any Russian invasion of Ukraine, he said, repeating the mantra that any such incursion would be met with massive consequences and severe economic costs. The responses were not unexpected and mirrored what senior U.S. and NATO officials have been saying for weeks. Nonetheless, they and the eventual Russian reaction to them could determine whether Europe will again be plunged into war. There was no immediate response from Russia but Russian officials have warned that Moscow would quickly take “retaliatory measures” if the U.S. and its allies reject its demands. Seeking possible off-ramps that would allow Russia to withdraw the estimated 100,000 troops it has deployed near Ukraine’s border without appearing to have lost a battle of wills, the U.S. response did outline areas in which some of Russia’s concerns might be addressed, provided it de-escalates tensions with Ukraine. Speaking to reporters in Washington, Blinken said Russia would not be surprised by the contents of the several-page American document that U.S. Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan delivered Wednesday to the Russian Foreign Ministry. “All told it sets out a serious diplomatic path forward. should Russia choose it,” he said. “The document we’ve delivered includes concerns of the United States and our allies and partners about Russia’s actions that undermine security, a principled and pragmatic evaluation of the concerns that Russia has raised, and our own proposals for areas where we may be able to find common ground.” Blinken said he hoped to speak with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov about the response in the coming days. But he stressed the decision about pursuing diplomacy or conflict rests with Russia and, more specifically, with Russian President Vladimir Putin. “We’ll see how they respond,” he said. “But there’s no doubt in my mind that if Russia were to approach this seriously and in a spirit of reciprocity with a determination to enhance collective security for all of us, there are very positive things in this in this document that could be pursued. We can’t make that decision for President Putin.” Shortly after Blinken spoke, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in Brussels that the alliance had sent a separate reply to Russia with an offer to improve communications, examine ways to avoid military incidents or accidents, and discuss arms control. But, like Blinken, he rejected any attempt to halt membership. “We cannot and will not compromise on the principles on which the security of our alliance, and security in Europe and North America rest,” Stoltenberg said. “This is about respecting nations and their right to choose their own path.” “Russia should refrain from coercive force posturing, aggressive rhetoric and malign activities directed against allies and other nations. Russia should also withdraw its forces from Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova, where they are deployed without these countries’ consent,” he said. While flatly refusing to consider any changes to NATO’s open-door policy, its relationship with non-ally Ukraine, or allied troop and military deployments in Eastern Europe, Blinken said the U.S. is open to other ideas to ease Russia’s stated concerns. The U.S. proposals, echoed in the NATO document, include the potential for negotiations over offensive missile placements and military exercises in Eastern Europe as well as broad arms control agreements as long as Russia withdraws its troops from the Ukrainian border and agrees to halt inflammatory rhetoric designed to deepen divisions and discord among the allies and within Ukraine itself. Moscow has demanded guarantees that NATO will never admit Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations as members and that the alliance will roll back troop deployments in former Soviet bloc nations. Some of these, like the membership pledge, are nonstarters for the U.S. and its allies, creating a seemingly intractable stalemate that many fear can only end in a war. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied it has plans to attack Ukraine, but the U.S. and NATO are worried about Russia massing its troops near Ukraine and conducting a series of sweeping military maneuvers. As part of the drills, motorized infantry and artillery units in southwestern Russia practiced firing live ammunition, warplanes in Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea performed bombing runs, dozens of warships sailed for training exercises in the Black Sea and the Arctic, and Russian fighter jets and paratroopers arrived in Belarus for joint war games. Speaking to Russian lawmakers Wednesday before the U.S. and NATO responses were delivered, Lavrov said he and other top officials will advise Putin on the next steps. “If the West continues its aggressive course, Moscow will take the necessary retaliatory measures,” Lavrov said. But he indicated Russia wouldn’t wait forever. “We won’t allow our proposals to be drowned in endless discussions,” he said. Amid the tensions, the U.S., Britain, Australia, Germany and Canada have moved to withdraw some of their diplomats and dependents from Kyiv, a move President Volodymyr Zelenskyy sought to play down Tuesday as part of a “complex diplomatic game.” On Wednesday, the U.S. urged Americans in Ukraine to consider leaving, saying the security situation “continues to be unpredictable due to the increased threat of Russian military action and can deteriorate with little notice.” In 2014, following the ouster of a Kremlin-friendly president in Kyiv, Moscow annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula and threw its weight behind a separatist insurgency in the country’s eastern industrial heartland. Fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed rebels has killed over 14,000 people, and efforts to reach a settlement have stalled. Envoys from Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany met Wednesday for more than eight hours in Paris on the separatist conflict. Although there was no breakthrough, they promised to meet for new talks in two weeks in Berlin. The French president’s office said afterward in a statement that the parties support “unconditional respect” for a cease-fire in eastern Ukraine. The talks focused on the 2015 Minsk peace agreement aimed at ending the conflict, and the statement didn’t address the current concerns about a Russian invasion of Ukraine. “Those are different issues, and we didn’t discuss it,” said Kremlin envoy Dmitry Kozak. The Ukrainian representative, Andriy Yermak, was cautiously optimistic about Wednesday’s talks, which he said marked the first major advance since December 2019. He also acknowledged they did not directly address current tensions at the border or resolve past differences. “Of course, I wouldn’t be honest if I said that we all want faster and bigger results,” Yermak said. “And of course there is nothing bigger than the desire of Ukrainian people to stop the war, to bring back our territories and our people.” Yermak also said the Ukrainians repeatedly raised the issue of troops now massed on the border. “This is the real threat,” he said. “I have clearly said today that we expect de-escalation not only around occupied territories but also in general de-escalation around Ukrainian borders.” Kozak said varying interpretations of the Minsk agreement have remained a major stumbling block. He said the the four parties will make another attempt to reach consensus on the issue in two weeks. Kozak reaffirmed that Russia isn’t a party to the conflict and emphasized that Ukraine is reluctant to engage in talks with separatists as stipulated in the Minsk document. He said there has been no progress on key aspects of the agreement that Ukraine must grant special status to the rebel regions, followed by elections. ___ Isachenkov reported from Moscow.

REUTERS/Vasily Fedosenko/File Photo LONDON, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Benchmark European gas prices jumped 15% this week after a major  pipeline bringing gas from Russia began sending flows eastwards. But why do Russian exports have such an impact on Europe's gas markets, even in countries that Russia doesn't directly supply?  read more HOW MUCH GAS DOES RUSSIA SUPPLY? Europe relies on Russia for around 35% of its natural gas. The bulk comes through pipelines including Yamal, which goes through Belarus and Poland to Germany, Nord Stream, which goes directly to Germany, and pipelines going through Ukraine. Europe’s internal gas markets are linked through a network of interconnecting pipelines. Not all countries get supply directly from Russia, but if countries such as Germany, the biggest consumer of Russian gas, see lower flows from Russia they must replace this from elsewhere such as Norway. That has a knock-on effect on how much gas is available from other sources for other countries, and for transit. Gas prices in Britain have been just as volatile as those in continental Europe on any news out of Russia, even though it only typically gets around 5% of its gas from Russia. Lower overall Russian supply to Europe means less could be available from its largest suppliers, like Norway. Europe's energy chief says European countries have enough gas to meet their needs over the winter. The issue, however, is the price they will need to pay. Last year gas exports from Russia fell because lower economic output, due to lockdowns designed to limit the spread of the coronavirus, led to a slump in demand. This year supplies to Europe failed to increase to match the rise in demand as economies recover. In the first 10 months of 2021 Russia supplied a total of 31,806 gigawatt hours a day of gas though its three main pipelines to Europe, Refinitiv Eikon data showed, down from 33,466 GWh/d during January-October 2020. The Yamal pipeline has been working in reverse mode for the last five days, taking gas from the west to the east, data from Germany's operator Gascade shows. Globally there has been a scramble for gas supplies, sending prices soaring particularly in Asia, which means Europe is finding it harder to attract international LNG cargos which are often directed to whichever region is willing to pay the most. Typically gas storage sites are replenished in the summer when demand and prices are lower, but this year high prices meant less was sent to storage sites and owners with gas in storage have been keen to hang on to it in case demand and prices rise even more, leaving Europe facing winter with lower stocks than usual. Despite lower flows state-owned gas pipeline monopoly Gazprom (GAZP.MM) has said it is fulfilling all its long-term contracts, and European companies contacted by Reuters confirmed contractual obligations had been met.  read more Russia prefers long-term gas contracts which can last for several years, over the short-term spot market which is based on one-off purchases. This is a way of ensuring it can retain market share and secure a consistent price, especially when Europe has said it is seeking new sources of gas. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Europe’s gas crisis is partly of its own making because of the shift to short-term spot deals. Less Russian gas has been available on the spot, day-to-day market, exacerbating the overall supply crunch in Europe. Gazprom-controlled gas storage sites in Europe also have less gas than usual for this time of year, with Russia saying it is concentrating on replenishing domestic stocks before releasing any more gas to Europe. It expects the replenishment process to finish by Nov. 8. Any significant changes in expectations of flows through the main Russian-EU pipelines or political declarations made by Russia can have a huge impact on daily EU gas prices. European benchmark gas prices hit a record 155 euros per megawatt hour (MWh) on Oct. 6 but plummeted the same day after Putin said Russia would send more gas to Europe, closing 26% down from the high at 114 euros/MWh. Flows through the Yamal Mallnow metering point in Germany at the Polish border have been flowing eastwards since Oct. 30, pushing benchmark European prices up around 15% since last week. Analysts have said the eastward flows could continue until Nov. 8, when Russia has said it expects its domestic storage sites to be filled.  read more Putin said last month Russia was ready to provide more gas to Europe if requested, and rejected any suggestion that Moscow was squeezing supplies for political motives.  read more EU energy commissioner Kadri Simson said the bloc had not asked more supplies from Russia, instead preferring to reach out to other trading partners. Norway, Europe's second-largest supplier of gas, pledged in October to increase exports.  read more Russia has said Nord Stream 2, which is set to double Moscow's annual gas export capacity in the Baltic, could provide relief to the European gas market. The route, jointly with the existing Nord Stream pipeline, will double annual export capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, around half of Russia's total gas exports to Europe a year. The pipeline has been controversial and some European lawmakers have suggested Russia has deliberately reduced flows to Europe to stoke demand for the new project and smooth its progress.  read more Although the construction on the new pipeline has been completed, flows cannot start until it receives regulatory approval from German authorities, which could take until Spring 2022, by which time peak European winter demand will be over.  read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

Belarus has been hit by a rising wave of coronavirus infections, with around 2,000 new cases reported daily in the country of 9.3 million. Authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko has often brushed off concerns about the coronavirus pandemic, once saying that infections could be treated with “a tractor, a bath and vodka.” Only about 20% of the population have been fully vaccinated.

The European Union accuses Belarus of flying in thousands of people from the Middle East and pushing them to cross into EU and NATO members Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, in response to European sanctions. Minsk, which denies fomenting the crisis, cleared a migrant camp near the border on Thursday and started to repatriate some people to Iraq, while Poland and Lithuania reported lower numbers of attempts to cross their borders in recent days. But Morawiecki warned the crisis was far from over as he toured Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia on Sunday to discuss the situation. A poll published by Poland’s Rzeczpospolita daily on Sunday said 55% of Poles are worried the crisis on the border could escalate into an armed conflict. “I think that the things that unfold before our eyes, these dramatic events, may only be a prelude to something much worse,” Morawiecki said in Vilnius. He pointed to increased Russian military presence close to Ukraine, as well as in Belarus and Russia’s Kaliningrad enclave which borders Poland and Lithuania, as “an instrument which could be used directly for a direct attack”. The situation in Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover “may be used as the next stage of the migration crisis,” said Morawiecki. Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte warned European partners to not ignore Belarus’ neighbours, after German Chancellor Angela Merkel twice called Lukashenko looking for solution of the humanitarian crisis. “For us, it is very important that any talks (with Belarus) are coordinated with Lithuania, Poland and Latvia, which are at the forefront of the hybrid attack, and no decisions are taken which do not solve the situation fundamentally”, she said after meeting with Morawiecki on Sunday. France’s foreign minister said on Sunday that Russia had to exert pressure on its ally, Belarus, to end the migrant crisis. Poland says Minsk continues to truck hundreds of foreigners to the frontier, where about 10 migrants are believed to have died with a frigid winter setting in. “On Saturday ... a group of about 100 very aggressive foreigners, brought to the border by Belarusian servicemen, tried to enter Poland by force,” the border guard said on Twitter on Sunday. A dozen migrants from Iraq, speaking with Lithuanian news portal DELFI over the border with Belarus on Saturday, said they were forcibly brought there in military trucks by Belarus officials, who ignored their wish to go back to Iraq. Hundreds of Poles took part in protests on Saturday to demand help for the migrants. The Catholic church organised a fundraiser on Sunday to collect money for those in need at the border and support the integration of refugees who will stay in Poland.

REUTERS/Yara Nardi/File Photo ROME, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by phone on Monday and discussed the migrant crisis at the Polish-Belarus border, energy prices and Ukraine, Draghi's office said. The talks took place amid intensified concerns about tensions over Ukraine that Russia on Monday compared to the build-up to a 2008 war in which Russian forces crushed those of neighbouring Georgia.  read more Putin told Draghi that Ukraine was not fulfilling its obligations under the Minsk and Normandy settlement agreements, the Kremlin said in a statement. ""Of particular concern are provocative steps by the Ukrainian side to deliberately exacerbate the situation in Donbass, including the use of weapons prohibited by the Minsk package of measures,"" Putin told Draghi, referring to a swathe of eastern Ukraine seized by Russia-backed separatists. The United States and fellow NATO member Turkey have supplied Ukraine respectively with Javelin anti-tank missiles and attack drones, while Britain is supporting the Ukrainian navy. Ukraine says it is upgrading its combat capabilities to defend itself against possible Russian aggression. The Kremlin accuses Ukraine of provocation, saying it was being supplied with a significant amount of arms, including high-tech weapons. Putin also told Draghi that Russia stood ready to ensure a flawless supply of natural gas to Europe, including via the Nord Stream 2 project. Last week, Germany temporarily halted the certification process for the new pipeline that will carry Russian gas into Europe, throwing up a new roadblock to the contentious project and driving up regional gas prices.  read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

Sputnik/Ramil Sitdikov/Kremlin via REUTERS/File Photo MOSCOW/KYIV, Nov 24 (Reuters) - (This Nov.24 story corrects Estonian Prime Minister title in paragraph 6) Russia staged military drills in the Black Sea, south of Ukraine, on Wednesday and said it needed to sharpen the combat-readiness of its conventional and nuclear forces because of heightened NATO activity near its borders. Ukraine, which says it believes Russia may be preparing an invasion, held exercises of its own near the frontier with Belarus.  read more An independent Russian investigative group posted photos and videos it said showed movements of tanks and other military vehicles in southern Russia in the past few days. The increase of military activity on both sides follows weeks of rising tension that have raised the risk of war between the two ex-Soviet neighbours, even though Russia denies aggressive intent and Western intelligence sources have told Reuters they do not see any invasion as imminent.  read more Ukraine is not a NATO member but the United States and the alliance have signalled their backing for Kyiv in ways that Moscow considers provocative, including through warship manoeuvres this month in the Black Sea and a delivery of U.S. patrol boats to the Ukrainian navy. British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told Reuters it would be ""a grave mistake from Russia"" to attack Ukraine.  read more Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said the European Union must make it clear to Russia that there would be a high price to pay if it acted against Ukraine, urging the EU to quickly agree on how to deter Moscow. read more In Wednesday's exercises in the Black Sea, Russian fighter planes and ships practiced repelling air attacks on naval bases and responding with air strikes, Interfax reported. Separately, the news agency quoted Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu as saying the need for Russia to further develop its armed forces was dictated by ""the complicated military and political conditions in the world and the growing activity of NATO countries near Russia's borders"". He said raising the armed forces' capabilities, supporting the combat preparedness of nuclear forces and strengthening the potential of non-nuclear deterrence are among the priorities. Shoigu complained on Tuesday that U.S. bombers had rehearsed a nuclear strike on Russia from two different directions earlier this month, and that the planes had come too close to the Russian border. The Pentagon said these drills adhered to international protocols. Ukraine, which has tilted towards the West since a popular uprising ousted a pro-Russian president in 2014, on Wednesday held what it called a ""special operation"" at the border with Belarus, including drone exercises and military drills for anti-tank and airborne units. It has deployed 8,500 extra troops to its boundary with Belarus, saying it fears being drawn into a migrant crisis which has seen the European Union accuse Minsk of flying in people from the Middle East and pushing them to enter neighbouring Poland. Belarus denies fomenting the crisis.  read more Kyiv also worries that the border with Belarus, a close Russian ally, could be used by Moscow to stage a military assault. The head of Ukraine's military intelligence told the Military Times outlet last weekend that Russia had more than 92,000 troops massed around Ukraine's borders and was preparing for an attack by the end of January or beginning of February. Moscow has dismissed such suggestions as inflammatory, said it was not threatening anyone and defended its right to deploy its troops as it wished. The Conflict Intelligence Team, an independent Russian investigative group, posted video and photos on its website showing movements of tanks, infantry combat vehicles and howitzers this month near Voronezh, about 190 km (120 miles) from the Ukrainian border, and a new concentration of army vehicles at a training ground to the south of the city. It also posted what it said was video evidence of military trains carrying infantry fighting vehicles and armoured personnel carriers in the past two days to Valuyki, 23 km from the Ukrainian border. The group said Russian troops had been arriving as well in Crimea, the peninsula seized by Russia from Ukraine in 2014. It said its assessment was that Russian troops would be ready for potential operations inside Ukraine no earlier than the start of next year. Intelligence sources, diplomats and analysts have told Reuters that Moscow may be using the escalation as part of a wider strategy to exert pressure in Europe, including by backing Belarus in the migrant crisis and parlaying its influence as the continent's top gas supplier into pressure for quick regulatory approval of its new Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany. ""It feels... more like another piece of coercive leverage that the Russians are heaping onto this strategic situation in Eastern Europe,"" said Samir Puri, senior fellow in hybrid warfare at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. ""It may well have value in that alone, rather than having to be followed through with a full-scale invasion which would be politically disastrous for Putin.""

And Ukraine, which also borders Belarus, said it would build a border fence and ditch and hold military drills to forestall any attempted influx of migrants. Around 50 migrants got through a fence into EU member Poland on Thursday, Anna Michalska, a spokeswoman for Poland’s Border Guard said. They included a family of five who said they wanted to stay in Poland, opening a procedure toward settlement. The others will have to return to Belarus, Michalska said. Two other large groups of migrants were prevented from entering. Some migrants have thrown stones and used tree branches to hit Polish border guards. Hundreds of Iraqis flew back home Thursday from Belarus after abandoning their hopes of reaching the EU. Still, many migrants remained in a heated warehouse that Belarus recently made available near the border. They had been camping in a cold and wet forest since Nov. 8. A charity collection was held in Michalowo, near Poland’s border with Belarus, with local people and some from across the country bringing clothes, blankets, food, toys and other items for hundreds of migrants who have entered Poland. Konrad Sikora, deputy mayor of Michalowo, told The Associated Press the reaction the charity is getting from all around Poland “is tremendous, it’s great, and I think we are helping those people really, really deeply.” Some migrants, the most needy, are still in the damp woods, others are in hospitals or in guarded centers for foreigners, waiting for their international protection applications to be processed. In most cases they are rejected. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Friday reiterated his warning that the situation on the border represents a security challenge. “We are ready to provide support,” Stoltenberg told reporters in Berlin. He welcomed ”the fact that Iraq is now taking back people and have stopped” flying migrants to Belarus. He also noted that NATO has seen “a significant military buildup by Russia close to the borders of Ukraine (with an) unusual concentration of forces.” “We call on Russia to be transparent and to prevent an escalation and to help and to reduce the tensions along the borders with Ukraine,” Stoltenberg said. Meanwhile, Poland’s President Andrzej Duda, on a visit to North Macedonia, said that in recent talks with Stoltenberg he has “indicated all possible hypothetical military threats” that might emanate from Belarus. “I believe that ... we are going to overcome this crisis and that the Belarusian regime is going to stop its hybrid attacks against our countries,” Duda said. Poland has notified Belarus it intends to halt railway freight traffic at the border crossing near Kuznica on Sunday, out of security concerns, due to the continuing presence of migrants at the warehouse there. Road traffic was stopped there last week. Tensions flared at the Poland-Belarus border in recent days, with about 2,000 people trapped between forces from the two countries. On Tuesday, Polish forces at the border used water cannon and tear gas against stone-throwing migrants. Warsaw accused the regime of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko of giving smoke grenades and other weapons to those trying to cross the frontier. The U.N. refugee agency says about half the migrants at the border area were women and children. The standoff set alarm bells ringing in the region. The West has accused Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko of using the migrants as pawns to destabilize the EU in retaliation for its sanctions on his authoritarian regime. Belarus denies engineering the crisis, which has seen migrants entering the country since last summer and then trying to cross into Poland, Lithuania and Latvia. In an interview with the BBC published Friday, Lukashenko said that it is “absolutely possible” that his forces helped migrants cross into Poland but he denied the migrants were invited and insisted: “I don’t want them to go through Belarus.” “We’re Slavs. We have hearts. Our troops know the migrants are going to Germany,” Lukashenko told the BBC. “Maybe someone helped them. I won’t even look into this,” he said. Ukraine, which borders both Belarus and Russia, said Friday it would build a 2,500-kilometer (1,550-mile) fence along its border with those neighbors to help fend off any illegal influx of migrants. Funds should be allocated next year for the building of the fence that will cost an estimated 17 billion hryvnas (about $640 million,) Minister of Internal Affairs Denys Monastyrskiy said. “Building a fence, a net and barbed wire, with a total coverage by surveillance and alarm systems, along the entire border ... is the most rational decision,” Monastyrskiy said, speaking in the Ukrainian parliament. Ukrainian authorities also plan to dig out a 4-meter (13-foot) wide and 2-meter (6.5-foot) deep ditch on the open parts of the country’s border with Russia and Belarus. The country is planning military exercises in the next two weeks to prepare for attempts by migrants to illegally cross into it. “Our key goal is to stop and contain a possible mass influx of illegal migrants,” Monastyrskiy said. On Friday, Ukrainian authorities reported intercepting a group of 15 people of Middle Eastern descent attempting to cross into Ukraine from Belarus -- the first such incident on the Ukrainian border since the crisis flared up. ____ Daria Litvinova in Moscow; Yuras Karmanau in Kyiv, Ukraine and Konstantin Testorides in Skopje, North Macedonia, contributed. ___ Follow AP’s global migration coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/migration __________ This story has been corrected to show that the spelling of the town with charity is Michalowo, not Michalow.",western,1,948,95.32,59.52,37.4,10.75,19.35,28.27,79.54,56.22,44.2,6.86,3.38,0.42,0.95,0.11,0.84,0.84,3.48,14.14,8.12,2.53,16.24,5.27,2.11,4.11,0.42,13.4,4.85,3.27,6.22,1.9,0.74,3.59,6.86,0.32,6.54,0.95,1.37,0.84,1.27,0.32,1.58,0,3.48,1.27,2.22,0.32,0.11,0.21,0,0.11,0,0,9.81,4.96,1.16,0.11,0.63,0.21,2.74,4.64,0,0,0.21,0.84,5.38,2.11,3.06,0.21,2.43,0.32,0.21,1.05,0.53,0.32,0.42,0.11,0.11,0,0,0,0,0.11,0,0.63,0.32,0.42,0,0,0,0.11,1.05,0.11,3.8,13.08,0.74,1.9,9.7,0.53,0.11,0.63,3.48,4.32,3.69,1.9,0.32,0.21,0.11,0,0,20.46,5.91,5.8,0,0,1.16,7.59

Press Service of General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine/Handout via REUTERS KYIV, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Ukraine's armed forces have conducted drills near the borders of Russian-annexed Crimea, the defence ministry said in a statement on Wednesday, amid growing tensions on the country's frontiers. The drills simulated Ukrainian marines, tanks and aircraft repelling an enemy attack, the defence ministry said. It also released footage showing marines manoeuvring with large-calibre machine guns, grenade launchers, tanks and helicopters. Earlier this month Ukrainian border guards, police and the national guard also held drills on the border with Belarus aiming to protect the country from possible attempts by migrants to breach the frontier. Ukrainian authorities have said Russia has left military units near the Ukrainian border after exercises, with the number of troops in the area now totalling at least 90,000 and the forces holding a series of large-scale drills. U.S. officials said they were worried about the build-up of Russian military power near Ukraine and the migrant stand-off between Belarus, a close ally of Russia, and the European Union. read more But Russia has complained about what it has called a dangerous increase in military activity by the United States and its allies in the Black Sea region, with greater Western spy plane activity, more strategic bombers flights and the presence of two U.S. warships. Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula, was annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014. This spring, Moscow alarmed Kyiv and Western capitals by building up more than 100,000 of troops along the border with Ukraine, though it later ordered them back to base.

Here’s a look at what is happening where and why: AFTER MOSCOW, ALL EYES ON UKRAINE French President Emmanuel Macron said his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin told him that he doesn’t plan to ramp up military tensions any further in Ukraine, nor will Moscow be keeping its troops in neighboring Belarus. Speaking in Kyiv, where he held talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Macron said Putin told him on Monday that “he won’t be initiating an escalation.” More than 100,000 Russian troops are deployed near Ukraine. Russian troop numbers in Belarus are expected to climb to 30,000. They’re in the country for joint war games, but the exercises are fueling tensions. Macron praised the “calm” and “self-restraint” of the Ukrainian authorities and people. Ukraine’s economy and currency have been hit by the tensions. Macron said Putin and Zelenskyy confirmed that they want to implement the Minsk peace agreement. Macron said the 2015 peace deal is “the only path on which peace can be built.” Macron’s trying to revive the “Normandy Format” peace talks aimed at ending almost eight years of fighting in eastern Ukraine in which more than 14,000 people have died. He said envoys from the four countries involved — France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine — will meet Thursday in Berlin. Zelenskyy said “the peace process” was at the heart of his talks with Macron. “We have a common view with President Macron on threats and challenges to the security of Ukraine,” he said after the meeting. The French leader then headed to Berlin to huddle with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Polish President Andrzej Duda, who is playing an increasingly prominent diplomatic role, and whose country borders western Ukraine and Belarus. Macron will also hold more phone talks with Putin. THE DRUMS OF WAR GAMES As the high-stakes diplomacy continues, Russia has kept up its military pressure, while NATO allies have been deploying troops and working on new plans for a longer-term presence in Eastern Europe; to deter Russia, not defend Ukraine. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday that six large landing ships were moving from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea, where they will take part in military exercises. U.S. officials consider the landing craft to be a significant addition to the Russian naval force in the region. The buildup of Russian troops in Belarus near Ukraine’s northern border continues too, for snap joint war games. NATO’s chief had warned of high-end fighter jets and S400 missile systems were deployed to Belarus and now says that “enabling capacities” like command and control and logistics units as well as field medical centers are being set up. NATO allies are now discussing plans to send battalions of troops to Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania. No decision on the move has been made yet, but it could mirror NATO’s presence in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, where 5,000 troops are deployed in a mission that’s run since 2016. Denmark, for its part, said that it’s stepping up military preparedness as security deteriorates because of the “unacceptable Russian military pressure on Ukraine,” according to a defense ministry statement. In London, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the U.K. is ready to bolster NATO forces in Latvia and Estonia. Johnson said he was considering dispatching RAF Typhoon fighters and Royal Navy warships to southeastern Europe. Britain is sending 350 troops to Poland to help bolster NATO forces in eastern Europe. NATO as an organization is not providing military support to Ukraine and will not come to the rescue should Russia invade, but some individual countries are helping to support the Ukrainian armed forces. The U.K. has already sent anti-tank weapons. Romania’s defense minister said Tuesday that more than 100 U.S. military personnel have already arrived in Romania ahead of a deployment of around 1,000 NATO troops expected in coming days. MEANWHILE, IN EASTERN UKRAINE The foreign minister of Germany, which has come under widespread pressure over its tepid role in the conflict, visited the “line of contact” in Ukraine’s Donbas region, where Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed separatists have faced off since 2014. Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said she went to the region “to get an impression of what it means that we still have war in the middle of Europe,” and to see first hand what damage has been done. Germany has given Ukraine about 1.8 billion euros in aid since 2014. Some has gone to help people forced from their homes by the fighting. Baerbock said it would be impossible “to solve this aggression from the Russian side militarily, so I am doing everything I can to make sure that we move forward step by step at the negotiating table.” But she warned: “At the same time, all of us in the international community, with our joint action and the list of sanctions, are doing everything we can to make it clear that any further military aggression from the Russian side would have massive consequences.” ___ Sylvie Corbet in Kyiv, Frank Jordans in Berlin, Jari Tanner in Helsinki, Jill Lawless in London, and Stephen McGrath in Bucharest, Romania, contributed to this report. ___ Follow all AP stories on the crisis over Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",western,1,906,89.21,62.32,25.96,23,22.65,27.92,77.81,56.62,43.82,6.51,3.2,0.22,0.66,0.22,1.32,0.55,3.31,10.38,6.07,1.99,16.23,7.28,2.43,5.52,0.77,15.01,3.42,3.31,8.94,2.54,1.21,5.19,7.73,0.88,6.51,0.99,1.88,1.1,0.44,0,2.1,0,4.86,2.54,2.32,0.44,0.11,0.33,0,0.22,0,0,12.69,6.73,1.32,0.11,1.21,0.22,3.42,5.96,0,0,0.22,1.1,5.74,3.75,1.77,0.22,2.21,0.55,0.22,1.1,0.33,0,0.55,0.11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.11,0.11,0.22,0.22,0,0,0,0,0.77,0,3.42,11.48,0.55,1.99,8.61,0.66,0,0.33,3.09,4.64,4.53,1.88,0.55,0.55,0.22,0,0,17.44,5.19,5.3,0,0,1.55,5.41

A sports center painted with the Olympic rings in a small Polish community directly on the border stands ready to house Ukrainian refugees. For now, the center in Medyka is empty. At the nearby border crossing, there is no sign of Ukrainians fleeing. Many Ukrainians do just the opposite: cross the border back into Ukraine after working or shopping in Poland, some defiantly vowing to defend their country in case of a Russian invasion. “Russia expected everyone to panic and flee to Europe, to just buy buckwheat and pasta, food, but we all bought machine guns and weapons and cartridges,” Volodymyr Halyk, 29, said. “No one is afraid, no one will abandon their homes, no one will flee.” Halyk and a friend, Volodymyr Yermakov, described themselves as veterans of the war against Russia-backed separatists that began in eastern Ukraine in 2014. Yermakov, 34, said he was prepared to take up arms again should Russian President Vladimir Putin launch an invasion. “Putin is an aggressor and does not allow anyone to live a normal life,” he said. “They want to take our territory, and that’s the truth.” Russia has denied plans to invade Ukraine, but Western officials have said that with an estimated 150,000 troops and equipment surrounding the country on three sides, an attack could happen at any time. People in Poland, which was controlled by Moscow during the Cold War, are following the news of Russia’s military buildup with concern. The Polish government last year became embroiled in a migration dispute with another eastern neighbor, Russian ally Belarus. Poland and the European Union accused Belarus of assisting people from the Middle East to cross the border into Poland. The Polish government called the migration part of an effort of hybrid war aimed at destabilizing central Europe and the EU. Mariusz Gumienny, the town council chairman in Medyka, said the thousands of additional U.S. troops who arrived in the area are helping to maintain a sense of security. “It calms the mood,” he said. The U.S. deployed nearly 5,000 more troops to Poland in recent weeks. They come in addition to 4,000 rotational troops the U.S. began sending after Russian actions against Ukraine in 2014. The job of the American soldiers is to reassure NATO ally Poland and to be in place to help evacuate U.S. citizens or Ukrainians should that be necessary. Local residents stand ready to help Ukrainians if the tensions with Russia escalate into a broader conflict, according to Gumienny. But he says people also worry that a large number of arrivals could overwhelm the town or that a prolonged war in Ukraine might cause wider instability. “There is no panic. You can’t see inhabitants trying to protect themselves in any way. But one thing is still in my mind: what will happen if a wave of refugees from Ukraine starts? This is what (people) fear most,” Gumienny told The Associated Press on Saturday. Poland is one of the easternmost members of NATO and the EU. Many Poles think membership in those organizations offers a good deal of protection from Russia as Putin seeks to reassert Russia’s authority in a region that he believes should return to Moscow’s sphere of influence. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said this week that a “free and sovereign Ukraine” was a matter of national interest for Poland. In addition to readying a plan to help any Ukrainians who might flee, Poland is also sending defensive weapons to its neighbor. At an international security conference in Munich, Germany, Morawiecki said Saturday that Poland plans to send more weapons to Ukraine. He said he thinks that Western countries have long ignored Russia’s attempts to restore its sway in the region but are finally becoming aware of the risk to all of Europe. Halyk, one of the Ukrainians vowing to defend his homeland, had his own warning for Europe. “Remember, when the last Ukrainian soldier dies, it will be your turn,” he said. “That is why we must unite, because we have a common goal, you can even say a common enemy, who will always want more, who is bloodthirsty, who will not allow anyone to live in peace.” ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the tensions between Russia and Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",western,1,744,90.93,63.14,38.65,3.96,20.11,24.6,83.06,59.95,45.83,7.93,3.9,0.13,0.54,0.4,1.34,0.81,4.03,14.92,8.2,1.61,14.78,6.32,2.02,4.57,1.08,14.11,5.38,3.9,7.53,2.55,1.21,3.76,10.08,1.61,8.47,1.21,0.94,1.61,1.88,0,2.69,0.13,5.78,1.75,3.9,1.75,0.4,1.21,0.81,0.27,0,0,12.63,5.51,0.94,0,1.34,0.13,2.42,6.85,0,0.27,0,1.34,4.17,2.96,0.94,0.27,2.82,0.27,0.67,1.61,0.27,0,0.81,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.27,0.13,0.4,0.27,0.4,0.13,0,0,0.13,1.61,0,4.17,14.11,0.67,2.28,10.75,0.13,0,0.67,2.42,3.36,3.63,2.42,0.13,0.13,0,0,0,17.61,5.91,6.05,0.13,0,1.21,4.3

The U.S. unveiled the intelligence during another day of diplomatic efforts to prevent the simmering tensions from boiling over into war. After talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan offered to mediate between Kyiv and Moscow by hosting talks. French President Emmanuel Macron spoke by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelenskyy. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, meanwhile, voiced concerns that Russia continues to build up troop numbers along Ukraine’s borders, including in Belarus. Here are things to know Thursday about the international tensions surrounding Ukraine, which has at least 100,000 Russian troops massed along its borders. U.S. WARNING OF A RUSSIAN ‘FALSE-FLAG’ OPERATION. U.S. intelligence indicates that the Russian government has developed a plan to stage a false attack that would depict the Ukrainian military or its intelligence forces assaulting Russian territory, a senior Biden administration official said Thursday. The plan includes production of a graphic propaganda video that would show staged explosions and would use corpses and actors depicting grieving mourners, according to the official, who was not authorized to comment and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The plan, which was revealed in declassified intelligence shared with Ukrainian officials and European allies in recent days, is the latest allegation by the U.S. and Britain that Russia is plotting to use a false pretext to go to war against Ukraine. The White House is concerned that the video, if released, could provide Putin “the spark” it believes he is looking for to credibly put military action in motion. __ By Nomaan Merchant and Aamer Madhani in Washington. ____ DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS TO DEFUSE CRISIS Erdogan has again offered to host talks between Moscow and Kyiv aimed at easing tensions that have sparked fears of war. “Turkey is prepared to undertake its part in order to end the crisis between two friendly nations that are its neighbors in the Black Sea,” he said during a joint news conference with Zelenskyy. “Instead of fueling the fire, we act with the logical aim of reducing the tensions,” Erdogan said as he offered to host a meeting “at a leadership level or technical level talks.” He reiterated Turkey’s commitment to Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty. Meanwhile, Putin met with Argentinian President Alberto Fernandez in Moscow and then spoke by phone to Macron, who had a call Wednesday night with U.S. President Joe Biden. Macron then spoke with Zelenskyy. The calls were part of Macron’s efforts to “pursue dialogue to identify elements that could lead to de-escalation,” according to Macron’s office. They discussed the efforts to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine and “conditions for strategic balance in Europe, which should allow for the reduction of risks on the ground and guarantee security on the continent.” — By Suzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey, and Angela Charlton in Paris. ___ NATO: ‘SIGNIFICANT’ RUSSIAN TROOP BUILDUP IN BELARUS Stoltenberg told reporters at NATO headquarters that Moscow has now deployed more troops and equipment to Belarus that at any time in the last 30 years. The NATO chief said Russian forces in Belarus are likely to rise to 30,000, including special forces, supported by fighter jets and missiles. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu arrived in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, on Thursday to monitor preparations for major Russia-Belarus war games expected to take place Feb. 10-20. Stoltenberg again called on Russia to “de-escalate,” and repeated warnings from the West that “any further Russian aggression would have severe consequences and carry a heavy price.” — By Lorne Cook in Brussels, and Dasha Litvinova in Moscow. ___ FRANCE SENDING TROOPS TO ROMANIA French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian confirmed Thursday that Paris is sending troop reinforcements to Romania under NATO command, as part of France’s commitment to the alliance and its member states in Eastern Europe. He did not say how many French soldiers will be deployed. The announcement came a day after the U.S. said it was moving troops stationed in Germany to Romania. Le Drian told a press conference in Bucharest that moving troops to NATO’s eastern flank should not disrupt diplomatic efforts to ease tensions over Ukraine. “The real goal here is de-escalation and all must be done to reach it as soon as possible,” Le Drian said. “How do we achieve it? By deterring and by talking.” Romania’s Foreign Minister Bogdan Aurescu said the two-track approach of military deterrence and diplomacy is the only way to ease boiling tensions and avert war. ___ UKRAINIAN DEFENSE MINISTER URGES CALM Ukraine’s defense minister is urging calm, saying the likelihood of a Russian invasion was “low.” Oleksii Reznikov said the threat of attack has loomed over the country since 2014, the year Russia seized Crimea, but he added: “There are no grounds for panic, fear, flight or packing of bags.” The minister said there are about 115,000 Russian troops near Ukraine’s border, including those deployed to Belarus for war games, but he said no battle groups have been detected along Ukraine’s border with Belarus. He also reiterated earlier assurances that Kyiv doesn’t plan to attack rebel-held areas in the war-torn east of Ukraine or Crimea — something the Kremlin has accused Kyiv of plotting. — By Yuras Karmanau in Kyiv. ___ PUTIN HEADING TO WINTER OLYMPICS After his meeting with Fernandez, Putin heads Thursday night to Beijing to bolster Moscow’s ties with China and coordinate their policies in the face of Western pressure. An ice hockey fan, Putin will also attend Friday’s opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics. His talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday will be their first face-to-face since 2019 and will help cement a strong personal relationship that has been a key factor behind a growing partnership between the two former Communist rivals. Yuri Ushakov, Putin’s foreign affairs adviser, said the visit would mark a new stage in a Russia-Chinа partnership that he described as a “key factor contributing to sustainable global development and helping counter destructive activities by certain countries.” Ushakov emphasized that China backs Russia in the current standoff over Ukraine. — By Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow. ___ Follow all AP stories on Russia and Ukraine tensions at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",western,1,1052,95.88,55.93,21.05,5.41,22.38,32.7,76.52,51.33,40.3,5.04,1.71,0,0.19,0,1.05,0.29,3.33,11.22,7.22,0.95,16.35,5.23,1.71,4.66,0.57,10.74,4.85,2,9.22,2.28,1.71,5.51,7.7,0.57,7.13,1.52,1.33,1.05,1.05,0.48,1.9,0,5.51,1.81,3.61,1.05,0.29,0.67,0.29,0.1,0.19,0,12.64,7.6,1.33,0.29,1.14,0.19,3.9,4.94,0,0,0,1.24,6.18,3.52,2.28,0.38,2.85,0.57,0.19,2,0.19,0,0.57,0.1,0,0.1,0,0,0,0.1,0.19,0.19,0,0.19,0,0,0,0.1,0.95,0.19,2.76,10.17,0.67,1.62,6.84,0.67,0.1,0.76,3.9,4.09,3.42,1.43,0.1,0.1,0,0,0,18.44,5.7,4.28,0.1,0,1.62,6.75

The court in the eastern city of Homiel sentenced 55-year-old Leanid Sudalenka to three years in prison and gave a 2 1/2-year sentence to 43-year-old Tatsiana Lasitsa on charges of organizing and financing actions violating the public order. Both have been in custody since their arrest more than nine months ago. Sudalenko has written from prison that the charges hinged on him meeting a colleague released from jail and helping a low-income farmer family to buy firewood — actions that investigators interpreted as organizing and funding protests. Sudalenka and Lasitsa worked for the Viasna human rights center, the country’s leading rights group. Another five leading members of Viasna, including its head Ales Bialiatski, are in custody awaiting trial. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and other international rights groups urged Belarusian authorities to immediately annul Wednesday’s sentence and strongly denounced “politically motivated prosecutions of Viasna members and volunteers (that) are part of the ‘purge’ of Belarusian civil society” by President Alexander Lukashenko’s government. “Belarusian authorities’ targeting of Viasna in particular is no doubt designed to punish the organization for its outstanding and courageous human rights work over the course of 25 years,” they said. Lukashenko faced months of protests triggered by his re-election to a sixth term in an August 2020 vote that the opposition and the West saw as rigged. He responded to the demonstrations with a massive crackdown that saw more than 35,000 people arrested and thousands beaten by police. Belarusian authorities have methodically ramped up the pressure against nongovernmental organizations and independent media, conducting hundreds of raids of offices and apartments of activists and journalists, and arresting scores. On Wednesday, Belarus’ Interior Ministry said that the online resources of Belsat, an independent Belarusian TV channel based in Poland, have been designated as extremist — a decision that follows July’s court ruling which already outlawed the TV channel as extremist. The moves have exposed its employees and viewers to prison terms. “The authorities are methodically cleansing Belarus’ information space, and the absurdity of the situation is that they assign the extremist designation several times,” said Andrei Bastunets, the head of the Belarusian Association of Journalists. “Officials apply the label of extremism to the media they can’t reach.” Even before the move, Iryna Slaunikava, a Belsat journalist, was sentenced to 15 days in jail on Monday for reposting Belsat’s content on her Facebook page. Slaunikava’s husband, Ales Loyka was also handed a 15-day sentence for reposting Belsat’s materials dating back several years. They were arrested on Saturday after returning from a trip to Egypt. In February, Belsat journalists Daria Chultsova and Katsiaryna Andreyeva were convicted of violating public order and sentenced to two years in prison after they covered a protest. ___ Uliana Pavlova in Moscow contributed to this report.",western,1,490,96.95,48.55,24.32,8.72,24.5,34.9,76.33,50,40.82,4.9,2.04,0,0,0,0.82,1.22,2.86,14.49,8.16,3.67,16.12,3.47,1.02,6.33,0.41,6.94,3.47,5.31,8.16,1.63,1.22,5.71,6.33,0,5.92,1.02,1.22,0.2,0,0.41,2.65,0,2.86,0.82,2.04,0.2,0.2,0,0,0,0,0,10.61,5.92,0.61,0,0.82,2.24,2.24,4.49,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.82,5.51,3.67,1.22,0.61,5.1,0.41,0.2,3.88,0.41,0.2,0.82,0,0,0,0,0.41,0,0.41,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.45,6.94,0.2,0.82,5.71,0.82,0,0,5.1,3.67,1.84,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.12,4.08,4.29,0,0,2.45,5.31

Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu noted recent efforts to boost military cooperation between the two allies, including modernization of military infrastructure for shared use. After a meeting of the two countries’ military top brass, Shoigu said he and his Belarusian counterpart extended agreements on two Russian military facilities in Belarus — an early warning radar in the Brest region near Poland and a naval communications center in Vileyka near the Belarusian capital of Minsk. He didn’t specify for how long they were extended. Russia and Belarus have a union agreement envisaging close political, economic and military ties. Moscow has staunchly backed Belarus’ authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko amid Western sanctions triggered by Belarusian authorities’ crackdown on protests following his re-election to a sixth term in an August 2020. Belarus’ opposition and the West rejected the election as a sham. In a bid to secure more Kremlin support, Lukashenko has repeatedly described Belarus as a bulwark against the West and called for boosting defense ties with Russia. Russia’s relations with the U.S. and its NATO allies have sunk to post-Cold War lows after Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula and support for a separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine. Earlier this month, NATO withdrew the accreditation of eight Russian officials to its Brussels headquarters, saying it believed they had been secretly working for Russian intelligence. Russia responded Monday by suspending its mission at NATO and ordering the closure of the alliance’s office in Moscow. Moscow has repeatedly voiced concerns over the deployment of NATO forces near Russian borders, describing it as a threat to its security. Russia and the alliance also have blamed each other for conducting destabilizing military exercises near the borders. Shoigu charged Wednesday that dozens of NATO drills near Russia’s borders have been used to rehearse scenarios of military confrontation with Russia. He specifically voiced concern about a buildup of NATO troops in Poland and the Baltics, the deployment of U.S. missile defense facilities in Romania and Poland and the modernization of tactical nuclear weapons in Europe. The Russian defense minister emphasized that NATO’s activities make “a coordinated defense policy, cooperation in the development of armed forces, an increase in coordination and combat training and a shared use of military infrastructure particularly acute for Russia and Belarus.”",western,1,404,98.31,53.36,21.97,12.47,25.25,38.37,74.75,49.75,40.84,3.96,1.73,0,0,0,1.24,0.5,2.23,13.37,8.91,1.98,17.33,2.97,1.73,5.69,0.25,7.67,5.69,2.48,13.12,2.72,0.5,9.9,3.71,0,3.71,0.74,2.23,0,0,0,0.99,0,3.71,1.49,2.23,0.25,0,0.25,0,0.25,0,0,9.41,6.68,2.23,0,1.24,0.25,2.48,3.47,0,0,0,1.24,9.16,6.93,1.98,0.25,1.73,0,0.25,1.24,0.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.99,0,1.73,9.9,0.25,0.25,9.41,0,0,0,3.71,4.21,0.74,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.38,4.95,2.72,0,0,3.22,1.49
978,apnews.com,2022-02-18 08:00:00,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-joe-biden-europe-russia-moscow-c2e55b8b2b061b58e2b140d2a6dc1d57,Allies watch for Kremlin attempt to justify Ukraine invasion,English,United States,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — U.S. President Joe Biden said Friday that he is “convinced” Russian President Vladimir Putin has decided to invade Ukraine, including an assault on the capital, as tensions spiked along the country’s militarized line with attacks that the West said could be “false-flag” operations meant to establish a pretext for invasion. A humanitarian convoy was hit by shelling, and pro-Russian rebels evacuated civilians from the conflict zone. A car bombing hit the eastern city of Donetsk, but no casualties were reported. After weeks of saying the U.S. wasn’t sure if Putin had made the final decision to invade, Biden said that assessment had changed, citing American intelligence. “As of this moment I’m convinced he’s made the decision,” Biden said. “We have reason to believe that.” He reiterated that the assault could occur in the “coming days.” Meanwhile, the Kremlin announced massive nuclear drills to flex its military muscle, and Putin pledged to protect Russia’s national interests against what it sees as encroaching Western threats. Biden reiterated his threat of massive economic and diplomatic sanctions against Russia if it does invade, and pressed Putin to rethink his course of action. He said the U.S. and its Western allies were more united than ever to ensure Russia pays a price for the invasion. With an estimated 150,000 Russian troops posted around Ukraine’s borders, U.S. and European officials warn that the long-simmering separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine could provide the spark for a broader attack. As further indication that the Russians are preparing for a potential invasion, a U.S. defense official said an estimated 40% to 50% of the ground forces deployed in the vicinity of the Ukrainian border have moved into attack positions nearer the border. That shift has been under way for about a week, other officials have said, and does not necessarily mean Putin has decided to begin an invasion. The defense official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal U.S. military assessments. The official also said the number of Russian ground units known as battalion tactical groups deployed in the border area had grown to as many as 125, up from 83 two weeks ago. Each battalion tactical group has 750 to 1,000 soldiers. Lines of communication remain open: The U.S. and Russian defense chiefs spoke Friday, and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin called for de-escalation, the return of Russian forces surrounding Ukraine to their home bases and a diplomatic resolution, according to the Pentagon. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov agreed to meet next week. Immediate worries focused on eastern Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces have been fighting pro-Russia rebels since 2014 in a conflict that has killed some 14,000 people. A bombing struck a car outside the main government building in the major eastern city of Donetsk, according to an Associated Press journalist there. The head of the separatist forces, Denis Sinenkov, said the car was his, the Interfax news agency reported. There were no reports of casualties and no independent confirmation of the circumstances of the blast. Uniformed men inspected the burned-out car. Shelling and shooting are common along the line that separates Ukrainian forces and the rebels, but targeted violence is unusual in rebel-held cities like Donetsk. However, the explosion and the announced evacuations were in line with U.S. warnings of so-called false-flag attacks that Russia would use to justify an invasion. Adding to the tensions, two explosions shook the rebel-controlled city of Luhansk early Saturday. The Luhansk Information Center said one of the blasts was in a natural gas main and cited witnesses as saying the other was at a vehicle service station. There was no immediate word on injuries or a cause. Luhansk officials blamed a gas main explosion earlier in the week on sabotage. Separatists in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions that form Ukraine’s industrial heartland known as the Donbas said they are evacuating civilians to Russia. The announcement appeared to be part of Moscow’s efforts to counter Western warnings of a Russian invasion and to paint Ukraine as the aggressor instead. Denis Pushilin, head of the Donetsk rebel government, said women, children and the elderly would go first, and that Russia has prepared facilities for them. Pushilin alleged in a video statement that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was going to order an imminent offensive in the area. Metadata from two videos posted by the separatists announcing the evacuation show that the files were created two days ago, The Associated Press confirmed. U.S. authorities have alleged that the Kremlin’s disinformation campaign could include prerecorded videos. Authorities began moving children from an orphanage in Donetsk, and other residents boarded buses for Russia. Long lines formed at gas stations as more people prepared to leave on their own. Putin ordered his emergencies minister to fly to the Rostov region bordering Ukraine to help organize the exodus and ordered the government to offer a payment of 10,000 rubles (about $130) to each evacuee, equivalent to about half of an average monthly salary in the war-ravaged Donbas. Ukraine denied planning any offensive. “We are fully committed to diplomatic conflict resolution only,” Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted. Around the volatile line of contact, a United Nations humanitarian convoy came under rebel shelling in the Luhansk region, Ukraine’s military chief said. No casualties were reported. Rebels denied involvement and accused Ukraine of staging a provocation. Separatist authorities reported more shelling by Ukrainian forces along the line. A surge of shelling Thursday tore through the walls of a kindergarten, injuring two, and basic communications were disrupted. Both sides accused each other of opening fire. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the threat to global security is “more complex and probably higher” than during the Cold War. He told the Munich conference that a small mistake or miscommunication between major powers could have catastrophic consequences. Russia announced this week that it was pulling back forces from vast military exercises, but U.S. officials said they saw no sign of a pullback — and instead saw more troops moving toward the border  with Ukraine. Meanwhile, the White House and the U.K. formally accused Russia of being responsible for recent cyberattacks targeting Ukraine’s defense ministry and major banks. The announcement was the most pointed attribution of responsibility for the cyber intrusions. Also Friday, the U.S. government released new estimates of how many military personnel Russia has in and around Ukraine. It said there are between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel, up from about about 100,000 on Jan. 30, according to Michael Carpenter, the permanent U.S. representative to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The new estimate includes military troops along the border, in Belarus and in occupied Crimea, as well as Russian National Guard and other internal security units, and Russian-backed forces in eastern Ukraine. The separatists inside Ukraine, the National Guard and troops in Crimea were not included in the previous U.S. estimate of 150,000. The Kremlin sent a reminder to the world of its nuclear might, announcing drills of its nuclear forces for the weekend. Putin will monitor the sweeping exercise Saturday that will involve multiple practice missile launches. Asked about Western warnings of a possible Russian invasion on Wednesday that didn’t materialize, Putin said: “There are so many false claims, and constantly reacting to them is more trouble than it’s worth.” “We are doing what we consider necessary and will keep doing so,” he said. “We have clear and precise goals conforming to national interests.” ___ Isachenkov reported from Moscow, Madhani from Munich and Miller from Washington.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was responding to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg’s comment this month that the alliance would need to consider relocating nuclear weapons east if the new German government changes the country’s policy on nuclear sharing. Lavrov described Stoltenberg’s statement as “absolutely irresponsible” and “outrageous.” “It’s not just fanning confrontation. It’s an attempt to provoke a hot conflict,” the minister said, speaking to members of the upper house of Russia’s parliament. Relations  between Russia and NATO sank to post-Cold War lows after Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and supported a separatist insurgency that started the same year in eastern Ukraine. Tensions escalated last month amid Ukrainian and Western concerns about a Russian troop buildup near Ukraine that raised fears that Moscow could invade its neighbor. The longtime leader of Belarus, President Alexander Lukashenko, said in a Tuesday interview that his country would be willing to host Russian nuclear weapons if NATO redeployed U.S. atomic bombs from Germany to Eastern Europe. Lavrov described Lukashenko’s offer as a “serious warning prompted by the reckless Western policy.”",western,1,212,92.41,51.31,23.57,1,23.56,42.45,77.36,51.42,33.96,5.66,0.94,0,0,0,0.47,0.47,4.72,11.79,7.08,0.47,12.26,4.25,1.42,5.19,0.47,10.38,8.96,1.89,9.43,2.36,0.94,6.13,8.49,0,8.49,0.47,1.89,2.36,1.42,0.47,3.3,0,7.55,1.42,6.13,0.94,0,0.94,0.47,0.47,0,0,16.98,10.85,0.94,0,1.89,1.42,5.19,5.66,0,0,0,0.94,11.32,7.55,2.36,1.42,2.36,0,0.47,1.89,0,0,0.47,0.47,0,0.47,0,0,0,0,0,0.47,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.42,0,1.89,10.85,0.94,1.42,7.55,0,0,0.94,4.25,2.83,0.94,0,0.47,0,0.47,0,0,17.92,6.13,2.36,0,0,4.25,5.19

But even as Moscow continues to bolster its forces and holds sweeping war games, President Vladimir Putin is keeping the window open for more negotiations in a calculated game of brinkmanship intended to persuade Washington and its allies to accept Russia’s demands. The West fears that a Russian invasion of Ukraine may be imminent, while Russia maintains it has no plans to do so but wants its security concerns addressed. Here is a look at the Kremlin’s strategy in the standoff: DEMANDS AND RESPONSES Russia wants the U.S. and its allies to keep Ukraine and other former Soviet nations from joining NATO, refrain from putting any weapons near Russia, and roll back alliance forces from Eastern Europe. Washington and NATO reject those demands as “nonstarters,” but they also are offering to discuss possible limits on missile deployments, a greater transparency of military drills and other confidence-building measures. Putin has yet to deliver Moscow’s formal response to the Western proposals, but he has already described them as secondary and warned that he wouldn’t take “no” for an answer on his main demands. He countered the Western argument about NATO having an open-door policy by arguing that it threatens Russia and violates the principle of the “indivisibility of security” enshrined in international agreements. MILITARY MUSCLE-FLEXING With the West rejecting its key demands, the Kremlin has raised the stakes by massing over 100,000 troops near Ukraine and carrying out a series of military maneuvers from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea. As part of the show of force, Moscow has moved trainloads of troops, tanks and weapons from the Far East and Siberia to Belarus for joint war games, drawing Western concerns that Russia could use them as a cover for an invasion. Washington and its allies are raising the prospect of unprecedented sanctions in the event of an invasion, including a possible ban on dollar transactions, draconian restrictions on key technology imports like microchips, and the shutdown of a newly built Russian gas pipeline to Germany. President Joe Biden’s administration also has deployed additional U.S. troops to Poland, Romania and Germany in a show of Washington’s commitment to protect NATO’s eastern flank. The U.S. and its allies have delivered planeloads of weapons and munitions to Ukraine. CALCULATED ESCALATION By concentrating troops that could attack Ukraine from many directions, Putin has demonstrated a readiness to escalate the crisis to achieve his goals. “Putin appears overconfident and is exhibiting a high level of risk-tolerance,” said Ben Hodges, who served as commanding general of the U.S. Army Europe and now works at the Center for European Policy Analysis. “He seems intent on applying maximum pressure on the West in this self-manufactured crisis, in hopes that Ukraine or NATO will eventually make concessions.” Some observers expect Putin to further ratchet up tensions by expanding the scope and area of the military drills. Fyodor Lukyanov, head of the Moscow-based Council for Foreign and Defense Policies who closely follows the Kremlin’s thinking, predicted a Western refusal to discuss Russia’s main demands would trigger a new round of escalation. “Logically, Russia will need to raise the level of tensions,” Lukyanov said. “If the goals set are not being achieved, then you need to increase pressure -- first of all through a demonstration of force.” Lukyanov said that while invading Ukraine is not what Putin wants, he may challenge the West by other means. “The whole idea as envisaged by Putin ... was not to solve the Ukrainian crisis by means of war, but to bring the West to the negotiations table about principles of European security arrangements,” Lukyanov noted. “The moment Russia starts a war against Ukraine, the whole previous game will be over and the new game will happen at an absolutely different level of risk. And all we know about Mr. Putin is that he is not a gambler. He is a calculated player.” POTENTIAL PATHS FOR COMPROMISE While Putin and his officials have insisted they expect the U.S. and NATO to bow to Russia’s demands — a prospect that looks all but impossible — some Kremlin-watchers expect Moscow to eventually accept a compromise that would help avoid hostilities and allow all sides to save face. Even though Western allies won’t renounce NATO’s open-door policy, they have no intention to embrace Ukraine or any other ex-Soviet nation anytime soon. Some analysts floated an idea of a potential moratorium on expanding the alliance. Gwendolyn Sasse, a Carnegie Europe fellow who heads the Centre for East European and International Studies in Berlin, voiced skepticism, saying that “the worst would be to signal that there are divisions in NATO,” noting that Putin might not be satisfied with it either. Another possibility is the “Finlandization” of Ukraine, meaning that the country would acquire a neutral status, the way Finland did after World War II. The policy helped it maintain friendly ties with the Soviet Union throughout the Cold War. Such a move would represent a sharp revision of Kyiv’s course toward NATO membership and likely fuel strong domestic criticism, but the Ukrainian public could eventually welcome the policy twist as a lesser evil, compared with a Russian invasion. Asked about the “Finlandization” idea, French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters Monday that “this is one of the models on the table,” but he backtracked the next day when he visited Kyiv. Another potential compromise would likely include steps to defuse tensions in eastern Ukraine, which has been controlled by Russia-backed separatists since a rebellion flared up there in 2014 shortly after Moscow’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula. Russia has urged the West to press Ukraine to fulfill its obligations under a  2015 peace deal  that was brokered by France and Germany and required Kyiv to offer self-rule to the rebel-held territories. The deal has been seen by Ukrainians as a betrayal of the country’s national interests and its implementation has stalled.

Putin’s move follows days of heightened tensions in Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland, where Ukrainian forces are locked in a nearly eight-year conflict with Russia-backed separatists that has left more than 14,000 people dead. Here is a look at the rebel-controlled territories in eastern Ukraine: SEPARATIST REBELLION IN THE EAST When Ukraine’s Moscow-friendly president was driven from office by mass protests in February 2014, Russia responded by annexing Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula. It then threw its weight behind an insurgency in the mostly Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine region known as Donbas. In April 2014, Russia-backed rebels seized government buildings in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, proclaimed the creation of “people’s republics” and battled Ukrainian troops and volunteer battalions. The following month, the separatist regions held a popular vote to declare independence and make a bid to become part of Russia. Moscow hasn’t accepted the motion, just used the regions as a tool to keep Ukraine in its orbit and prevent it from joining NATO. Ukraine and the West accused Russia of backing the rebels with troops and weapons. Moscow denied that, saying any Russians who fought there were volunteers. Amid ferocious battles involving tanks, heavy artillery and warplanes, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014, killing all 298 people aboard. An international probe concluded that the passenger jet was downed by a Russia-supplied missile from the rebel-controlled territory in Ukraine. Moscow still denied any involvement. PEACE AGREEMENTS FOR EASTERN UKRAINE After a massive defeat of Ukrainian troops in August 2014, envoys from Kyiv, the rebels and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe signed a truce in the Belarusian capital of Minsk in September 2014. The document envisaged an OSCE-observed cease-fire, a pullback of all foreign fighters, an exchange of prisoners and hostages, an amnesty for the rebels and a promise that separatist regions could have a degree of self-rule. The deal quickly collapsed and large-scale fighting resumed, leading to another major defeat for Ukrainian forces at Debaltseve in January-February of 2015. France and Germany brokered another peace agreement, which was signed in Minsk in February 2015 by representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the rebels. It envisaged a new cease-fire, a pullback of heavy weapons and a series of moves toward a political settlement. A declaration backing the deal was signed by the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany. A FROZEN CONFLICT IN UKRAINE The 2015 peace deal was a major diplomatic coup for the Kremlin, obliging Ukraine to grant special status to the separatist regions, allowing them to create their own police force and have a say in appointing local prosecutors and judges. It also envisaged that Ukraine could only regain control over the roughly 200-kilometer (125-mile) border with Russia in rebel regions after they get self-rule and hold OSCE-monitored local elections — balloting that would almost certainly keep pro-Moscow rebels in power there. Many Ukrainians see it as a betrayal of national interests and its implementation has stalled. The Minsk document helped end full-scale fighting, but the situation has remained tense and regular skirmishes have continued. With the Minsk deal stalled, Moscow’s hope to use rebel regions to directly influence Ukraine’s politics has failed but the frozen conflict has drained Kyiv’s resources and effectively stymied its goal of joining NATO — which is enshrined in the Ukrainian constitution. Moscow also has worked to secure its hold on the rebel regions by handing out more than 720,000 Russian passports to roughly one-fifth of their population of about 3.6 million. It has provided economic and financial assistance to the separatist territories, but the aid has been insufficient to alleviate the massive damage from fighting and shore up the economy. The Donbas region accounted for about 16% of Ukraine’s GDP before the conflict. EFFORTS TO REVIVE PEACE DEAL Amid soaring tensions over the Russian troop concentration near Ukraine, France and Germany embarked on renewed efforts to encourage compliance with the 2015 deal, in hopes that it could help defuse the current standoff. Facing calls from Berlin and Paris for its implementation, Ukrainian officials have strengthened their criticism of the Minsk deal and warned that it could lead to the country’s demise. Two rounds of talks in Paris and Berlin between presidential envoys from Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany have yielded no progress. The lower house of the Russian parliament, meanwhile, urged Putin last week to recognize the independence of Ukraine’s rebel regions. PUTIN RECOGNIZES REBEL REGIONS’ INDEPENDENCE Putin’s recognition of the rebel-held territories’ independence effectively shatters the Minsk peace agreements and will further fuel tensions with the West. He said that Moscow would sign friendship treaties with the rebel territories, a move that could pave the way for Russia to openly support them with troops and weapons. The move follows several days of shelling that erupted along the line of contact in Donetsk and Luhansk. Ukraine and the West accused Moscow of fomenting the tensions to create a pretext for an invasion. Russia, in turn, accused Ukraine of trying to reclaim the rebel-held territories by force, the claim that Kyiv strongly rejected. On Friday, separatist leaders released video statements announcing the evacuation of civilians in the face of what they described as a Ukrainian “aggression.” The data embedded in the video indicated that their statements had been pre-recorded two days earlier when the situation was still relatively calm, suggesting a deliberate plan to try to sever the regions from Ukraine. The rebel chiefs put out new video statements Monday urging Putin to recognize their regions’ independence and the Russian leader responded quickly by convening a carefully orchestrated meeting of his Security Council and then signing the recognition decrees in a televised ceremony. ___ Yuras Karmanau in Kyiv, Ukraine and Edith M.

And Ukraine, which also borders Belarus, said it would build a border fence and ditch and hold military drills to forestall any attempted influx of migrants. Around 50 migrants got through a fence into EU member Poland on Thursday, Anna Michalska, a spokeswoman for Poland’s Border Guard said. They included a family of five who said they wanted to stay in Poland, opening a procedure toward settlement. The others will have to return to Belarus, Michalska said. Two other large groups of migrants were prevented from entering. Some migrants have thrown stones and used tree branches to hit Polish border guards. Hundreds of Iraqis flew back home Thursday from Belarus after abandoning their hopes of reaching the EU. Still, many migrants remained in a heated warehouse that Belarus recently made available near the border. They had been camping in a cold and wet forest since Nov. 8. A charity collection was held in Michalowo, near Poland’s border with Belarus, with local people and some from across the country bringing clothes, blankets, food, toys and other items for hundreds of migrants who have entered Poland. Konrad Sikora, deputy mayor of Michalowo, told The Associated Press the reaction the charity is getting from all around Poland “is tremendous, it’s great, and I think we are helping those people really, really deeply.” Some migrants, the most needy, are still in the damp woods, others are in hospitals or in guarded centers for foreigners, waiting for their international protection applications to be processed. In most cases they are rejected. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Friday reiterated his warning that the situation on the border represents a security challenge. “We are ready to provide support,” Stoltenberg told reporters in Berlin. He welcomed ”the fact that Iraq is now taking back people and have stopped” flying migrants to Belarus. He also noted that NATO has seen “a significant military buildup by Russia close to the borders of Ukraine (with an) unusual concentration of forces.” “We call on Russia to be transparent and to prevent an escalation and to help and to reduce the tensions along the borders with Ukraine,” Stoltenberg said. Meanwhile, Poland’s President Andrzej Duda, on a visit to North Macedonia, said that in recent talks with Stoltenberg he has “indicated all possible hypothetical military threats” that might emanate from Belarus. “I believe that ... we are going to overcome this crisis and that the Belarusian regime is going to stop its hybrid attacks against our countries,” Duda said. Poland has notified Belarus it intends to halt railway freight traffic at the border crossing near Kuznica on Sunday, out of security concerns, due to the continuing presence of migrants at the warehouse there. Road traffic was stopped there last week. Tensions flared at the Poland-Belarus border in recent days, with about 2,000 people trapped between forces from the two countries. On Tuesday, Polish forces at the border used water cannon and tear gas against stone-throwing migrants. Warsaw accused the regime of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko of giving smoke grenades and other weapons to those trying to cross the frontier. The U.N. refugee agency says about half the migrants at the border area were women and children. The standoff set alarm bells ringing in the region. The West has accused Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko of using the migrants as pawns to destabilize the EU in retaliation for its sanctions on his authoritarian regime. Belarus denies engineering the crisis, which has seen migrants entering the country since last summer and then trying to cross into Poland, Lithuania and Latvia. In an interview with the BBC published Friday, Lukashenko said that it is “absolutely possible” that his forces helped migrants cross into Poland but he denied the migrants were invited and insisted: “I don’t want them to go through Belarus.” “We’re Slavs. We have hearts. Our troops know the migrants are going to Germany,” Lukashenko told the BBC. “Maybe someone helped them. I won’t even look into this,” he said. Ukraine, which borders both Belarus and Russia, said Friday it would build a 2,500-kilometer (1,550-mile) fence along its border with those neighbors to help fend off any illegal influx of migrants. Funds should be allocated next year for the building of the fence that will cost an estimated 17 billion hryvnas (about $640 million,) Minister of Internal Affairs Denys Monastyrskiy said. “Building a fence, a net and barbed wire, with a total coverage by surveillance and alarm systems, along the entire border ... is the most rational decision,” Monastyrskiy said, speaking in the Ukrainian parliament. Ukrainian authorities also plan to dig out a 4-meter (13-foot) wide and 2-meter (6.5-foot) deep ditch on the open parts of the country’s border with Russia and Belarus. The country is planning military exercises in the next two weeks to prepare for attempts by migrants to illegally cross into it. “Our key goal is to stop and contain a possible mass influx of illegal migrants,” Monastyrskiy said. On Friday, Ukrainian authorities reported intercepting a group of 15 people of Middle Eastern descent attempting to cross into Ukraine from Belarus -- the first such incident on the Ukrainian border since the crisis flared up. ____ Daria Litvinova in Moscow; Yuras Karmanau in Kyiv, Ukraine and Konstantin Testorides in Skopje, North Macedonia, contributed. ___ Follow AP’s global migration coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/migration __________ This story has been corrected to show that the spelling of the town with charity is Michalowo, not Michalow.",western,1,948,95.32,59.52,37.4,10.75,19.35,28.27,79.54,56.22,44.2,6.86,3.38,0.42,0.95,0.11,0.84,0.84,3.48,14.14,8.12,2.53,16.24,5.27,2.11,4.11,0.42,13.4,4.85,3.27,6.22,1.9,0.74,3.59,6.86,0.32,6.54,0.95,1.37,0.84,1.27,0.32,1.58,0,3.48,1.27,2.22,0.32,0.11,0.21,0,0.11,0,0,9.81,4.96,1.16,0.11,0.63,0.21,2.74,4.64,0,0,0.21,0.84,5.38,2.11,3.06,0.21,2.43,0.32,0.21,1.05,0.53,0.32,0.42,0.11,0.11,0,0,0,0,0.11,0,0.63,0.32,0.42,0,0,0,0.11,1.05,0.11,3.8,13.08,0.74,1.9,9.7,0.53,0.11,0.63,3.48,4.32,3.69,1.9,0.32,0.21,0.11,0,0,20.46,5.91,5.8,0,0,1.16,7.59

Speaking to journalists, including the BBC, the senior intelligence official, who asked not to be named,  said: ""Let's not be blind. If Russia initiates a scenario of any kind it will also initiate action against Nato members"". ""To think war could be contained to one nation would be foolish,"" they added. Those concerns have been echoed by Britain's most senior military officer. On Tuesday, the Chief of the Defence Staff, Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, told reporters: ""The significance of the worst scenarios in terms of a full-scale invasion would be on a scale not seen in Europe since the Second World War"". The admiral described Russia's military build-up on its border with Ukraine as ""deeply worrying"". Despite warnings from the US and its Nato allies that any invasion by Russia of Ukraine would have ""severe economic consequences,"" Moscow's military build-up on the border continues. The senior Western intelligence official described it as a ""steady"" rather than dramatic. Western intelligence estimates that Russia already has up to 100,000 troops positioned near to the border with Ukraine, along with tanks and artillery. Washington has suggested that force could rise to 175,000 by the end of January. The Western defence official said that if Russia chose to carry out an attack now it could do so. But he said Russian forces massed on the border were still missing some crucial elements - such as full logistical support, ammunition stocks, field hospitals and blood banks. The intelligence official described the build-up as a ""slow drip"" and a ""slow ratcheting up of pressure"". US officials have also pointed to an increase in Russia's social media ""disinformation"". Meanwhile, other Western defence sources have expressed concern about an increase in signals intelligence and ""chatter"" being monitored which could signal Russia's preparedness to invade. If Russia did decide to invade Ukraine, the senior Western intelligence official said large numbers of people would be displaced. ""We could have a very large number of refugees, deaths could reasonably be expected to be high as would destruction within Ukraine,"" he said. The war that erupted in eastern Ukraine in 2014 has already left 14,000 dead and an estimated 1.4 million displaced. Russian troop build-up: View from Ukraine front line But the official said Russia could also initiate actions against Nato members such as cyber and hybrid warfare, and even physical attacks. ""If there's a spill over elsewhere, all of these effects could be expanded,"" he said. The West is still unclear about President Putin's intent. But the senior Western intelligence official warned that ""military options are highly likely on the table in the Kremlin"" if Russia's demands are not satisfied. ""Has Putin decided to initiate a conflict? The jury is still out,"" he said. But the official noted there had been a combination of sharp bellicose rhetoric from Moscow, accusations of being provoked by Ukraine and Nato, a lack of transparency, and a worrying track record, including the annexation of Crimea in 2014. ""Added to that are the recent border crisis involving thousands of migrants in Belarus, as well as Russia's backing of separatists in the Caucasus and elsewhere,"" he said. While the official said it was hard to say these were all strategically related, it showed that there was an issue on Eastern Europe's eastern flank. He said the security situation in Europe was without precedent since the fall of the Iron Curtain. The US and Nato have made clear they want a dialogue with Russia to avoid conflict, and Moscow wants dialogue to continue, too. President Biden's virtual meeting with President Putin earlier this week was a start and will be followed up by more talks with other Nato members. But Russia's demands and so-called ""red lines"" are making diplomacy difficult. Russia wants assurances that Ukraine will never be allowed to join Nato; that Nato members will have no permanent forces or infrastructure based in Ukraine; and for a halt to military exercises near Russia's border. Nato insists it is a defensive alliance and not a threat to Russia. But the alliance has also made clear that it believes that Ukraine has a right to make its own decisions as a sovereign nation, and it is not willing to give Russia a veto on Ukraine's future.",western,1,728,84.77,40.06,30.09,6.93,20.8,29.12,85.16,63.32,48.63,5.63,1.65,0,0.41,0,0.82,0.27,3.98,13.46,8.52,1.37,14.7,9.07,3.71,6.73,1.1,15.52,7.83,3.02,8.38,1.79,0.14,6.46,12.91,0.55,12.36,1.37,2.88,2.47,1.92,0.14,3.98,0,4.81,1.65,3.16,0.41,0,0.41,0.27,0.14,0,0,10.99,6.87,0.55,0.14,1.51,0.14,4.12,4.67,0,0,0,0.96,4.67,3.71,0.41,0.55,1.24,0,0.14,0.96,0.41,0,0.82,0.14,0.14,0,0,0,0,0,0.27,0.27,0.41,0,0.14,0.27,0,0,1.1,0,2.88,11.13,0.41,0.96,8.65,0.82,0.27,0.14,3.57,5.22,3.43,1.37,0,0,0,0,0,17.72,4.81,4.67,0.14,0,2.06,6.04

Four European diplomats told Reuters that U.S. officials had raised their concerns about an attack on Ukraine with their European Union allies at a briefing in Brussels. Two said the meeting was held on Wednesday with 30 ambassadors at the level of the NATO transatlantic alliance. France's foreign and defence ministers, Jean-Yves Le Drian and Florence Parly, issued an unusually blunt statement after meeting their Russian counterparts in Paris. ""The two ministers expressed their concerns about the deteriorating security situation in Ukraine and clearly warned of the serious consequences of any further possible damage to the territorial integrity of Ukraine,"" the statement said. Earlier in the day, Russia had dismissed as inflammatory suggestions Moscow might be weighing an attack and accused the United States of aggressive moves in the Black Sea. The European diplomats declined to give further details on U.S. reasons or evidence for fearing an attack. In addition, one diplomatic source said that last week at a North Atlantic Council meeting - the principal political decision-making body within NATO - Karen Donfried, Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, briefed in more detail on her recent trip to Moscow and shared her concern about the troop build-up. ""The patterns of Russian behaviour are different from what we have seen before,"" a NATO source said without elaborating. ""So far, it is unclear if this military build-up is intended to lead to an incursion into Ukraine or if it is just another exercise."" Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and says the waters around it belong to Moscow now despite most countries continuing to recognise the peninsula as Ukrainian. Russian-backed separatists took control of Ukraine's eastern Donbass region that same year and soldiers on both sides continue to be regularly killed in the conflict there. The Kremlin said it was up to Moscow where it deployed within its borders. ""Such headlines do nothing more than pointlessly and groundlessly fuel tensions. Russia does not pose a threat to anyone,"" said spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, in Paris for the talks with Parly and Le Drian, was quoted by TASS as saying it was important to work with France to de-escalate the Ukrainian situation. In another rare rebuke of Moscow, Paris earlier this week accused it of blocking efforts to put together a ministerial meeting between France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine that aims to push peace accords agreed in 2014. France and Germany accused Russia of imposing unrealistic conditions, something Moscow denies. The European Union this week accused close Russian ally Belarus of encouraging thousands fleeing war-torn parts of the world to try to cross its borders. Brussels is expected to impose new sanctions next week, diplomats have said. There is no suggestion at this stage that Russia is supporting Belarus operationally, although it has publicly chided the EU. Russia's ministry of defence said it detected six flights by NATO spy planes in airspace over the Black Sea, part of what it described as intensifying reconnaissance by the Western military. The Russian military also said it was tracking U.S. naval ships in the Black Sea and accused Washington of studying the region as a potential theatre of war. After returning from Washington, Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Kyiv and its Western allies had stepped up diplomatic efforts to warn Russia against launching a new military attack on Ukraine.

An estimated 100,000 Russian troops have been deployed near Ukraine, although Russia denies it has any plans to invade. The US and its allies have threatened new sanctions, but the two sides have agreed to keep talking. As the situation intensifies, two of the BBC's most senior journalists on the region answer your questions. You can read the full question and answer exchange here. 1. Are the countries around Ukraine safe from a bigger war? - Hristo, Bulgaria Paul Adams writes: There's no war, yet, and hopefully conflict can be avoided. The diplomats are still talking. But, yes, it's not only Ukraine that's worried about the possibility of war. Other countries in the region - like the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia - are concerned that any future conflict could spread to their countries. 2. In the event of an invasion, how likely are civilian casualties? - Danil Gorbununov, Ukraine Paul Adams writes: This could play out in any number of ways, from so-called ""hybrid"" attacks - hacking, disinformation, etc - all the way up to a full-scale invasion, the likes of which Europe has not seen since World War Two. One way or another, civilians will be caught up in it. They might find themselves freezing in their homes as the power grid collapses, or trapped behind Russian lines if, as some have speculated, Russian tanks move in from the territory of neighbouring Belarus (personally I find this unlikely, but Russia seems happy to keep everyone guessing). This conflict has already claimed around 14,000 Ukrainian lives. If Russia tries to take more territory or install a more friendly regime in Kyiv, it's hard to see how this won't result in many, many casualties. 3. Why does Russia fear Nato? - Mike Hancock, US Steve Rosenberg writes: I don't believe Russian officials really fear Nato, which is a defensive alliance. According to the US Secretary of State, only 6% of Russia's borders touch Nato countries. Is that a threat to Russian national security? Also, many Nato countries actually have good relations with Moscow, and Russia even sells weapon systems to Turkey, a Nato member. I think this is more about the Kremlin trying to carve out a sphere of influence for itself on its doorstep - and using Nato as an excuse to do that. 4. Would this story be very different if Ukraine was already a Nato member? - Ryan Johnston, Belfast, Northern Ireland Paul Adams writes: Ukraine (and Georgia) have been on a theoretical path to Nato membership since a summit in Bucharest in 2008. But it's a long and rocky path. Since 2014, when Ukrainians got rid of a president they thought was going to side with Russia rather than Europe, the country has been at war with Russia. First Russia took over Crimea. Then it encouraged pro-Russian separatists in the south-east of the country (the area called the Donbas). Nato can't welcome members who are already involved in conflicts of this kind. There are also all sorts of other things Ukraine needs to do, in terms of political reforms and improving their military. Right now, to welcome Ukraine into Nato would be seen as the ultimate red rag to a Russian bull. So no-one thinks it's going to happen any time soon. In many ways, this is a red herring, as President Putin knows perfectly well that membership is not around the corner. 5. If Putin says he won't invade Ukraine, why is the US warning Russia? - Assad Ullah, China Paul Adams writes: Words are one thing (and you're right - the Russians keep saying they won't invade), but their actions point in another direction. There has been the massing of forces, the support for separatists in the Donbas (including handing out around one million Russian passports), and the threat of dire consequences if Ukraine does anything provocative (which, until now, it sensibly hasn't). Plus, President Putin's rejection of Ukraine's independent identity is not a secret - he wrote a long essay on the subject last year. You can read it online, but be prepared for a deep dive into ancient Russian history. 6. What is Putin's justification for so many troops on the border? - Richard Sullivan, Gloucestershire, UK Steve Rosenberg writes: Basically, Russia's position is: ""Hey, this is our country: we can move our troops wherever we want to on our territory."" The result - an estimated 100,000 Russian soldiers near its border with Ukraine, plus more Russian troops arriving in Belarus for snap war games. A potential invasion force, says the West. Moscow denies it. Russian troop build-up: View from Ukraine front line 7. Why are the superpowers interested in Ukraine? Ernest Onyameamah, Ghana Paul Adams writes: For Russia, it's all about recreating something that was lost with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 - a Russian sphere of influence. People also ignore how humiliated some Russians felt by the end of the Soviet empire and the West's eager expansion into eastern Europe. It left deep scars. For the US, it's about defending the principle that countries have the right to choose their own destiny, alliances and future paths. Not just Ukraine, but all those former members of the old Warsaw Pact (a Soviet-led military alliance during the Cold War) who turned to Nato in the 1990s. It's also about trying, as much as it can, to limit what the West sees as Vladimir Putin's malign influence. 8. What could Russia do to Europe's gas supplies? - George Steve Rosenberg writes: Could Russia choke off gas supplies if the West hits Russia with sanctions in the event of an invasion? It's a possibility. Russia likes to portray itself as a reliable energy supplier. But in a sanctions war, the energy gloves might come off. The EU relies on Russia for 40% of its gas. So any supply reduction or cuts by Russia would be felt acutely in Europe. True, Russia would lose out financially, too. But the Russians think they have an alternative market - China - and are already looking to boost energy supplies there. 9. How are people in Ukraine feeling? Paul Adams writes: I was in Kyiv last week and I found a mixture of apprehension and resignation. As President Zelensky says, ""what's new here?"" - Ukraine and Russia have been at loggerheads for eight years. War is already a reality, even if the conflict in the Donbas is now a frozen, low-level confrontation. I didn't detect any panic in Kyiv, but people did seem to believe that one day, unless he's stopped, Vladimir Putin will try to do something. They know where their bomb shelters are and some say they're willing to volunteer in one way or another if war breaks out. But they're really tired of the conflict and have no appetite for a fight which they know they would probably lose. 10. Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? Paul Adams writes: The only honest answer any of us can give right now is that we have absolutely no idea. Russia has certainly assembled enough men and equipment to do something in Ukraine. Not enough (by a mile) for a full scale invasion, but enough, perhaps, to mount a more limited operation - perhaps in the Donbas. But Russians are not clamouring for war and Putin knows that ""victory"" in Ukraine could kill an awful lot of his own soldiers. Does his visceral distaste for the very idea of Ukraine trump all other rational considerations? Surely not. But he's caught the West's attention and he has a long list of demands which go way beyond the question of Ukraine and Nato (particularly as he knows Ukraine is not about to join). So he will continue to hold a figurative gun against Ukraine's head while he pursues his wider agenda. And as any film buff will tell you, when there's a gun on the table, it usually means someone's going to use it later.",western,1,1328,71.39,37.88,50.75,5.76,15.26,21.69,82.76,62.95,51.51,8.51,3.61,0.45,0.6,0.38,0.83,1.2,4.89,14.53,7.83,2.26,14.01,8.73,5.57,6.63,1.51,15.74,5.72,4.37,7.3,2.18,0.75,4.44,14.76,0.9,13.86,3.09,1.66,1.81,3.77,0.53,4.59,0,5.8,1.96,3.69,1.28,0.3,0.83,0.45,0.15,0,0,10.47,5.27,0.6,0.15,1.51,0.23,2.26,5.2,0,0,0,0.9,4.74,3.24,1.43,0.08,1.58,0.23,0.15,0.98,0.23,0,0.68,0.15,0,0,0,0,0,0.08,0.23,0.15,0.15,0.38,0.15,0.3,0.08,0.08,0.83,0.08,4.74,11.22,0.38,0.9,8.96,0.6,0,0.45,2.86,2.56,7.15,1.96,0.23,0.08,0.15,0,0,20.26,5.5,5.65,1.05,0,2.71,5.35

They stand guard at the Senkivka crossing, where the Kremlin once celebrated the unity of the Soviet world. A few truck drivers heading south to the capital, Kyiv, cluster near the Three Sisters monument - a white obelisk erected back in 1975 to mark where the borders of Ukraine, Russia and Belarus meet. Maj Sergiy Khomenko, 29, comes from a military family and grew up in a border village. The current crisis with Russia would have been unimaginable in his parents' youth. But he serves a Ukraine that has been consistently pushing away from the orbit of Moscow. ""The independence of Ukraine is enshrined in all our documents. It is in our constitution. As a military man, I need to protect this,"" he tells me. Maj Khomenko is careful to stress that, for him, the possibility of Russian action on the border is ""the same today as it was yesterday"". In other words, he and his men are determined not to be destabilised by the presence of more than 100,000 Russian troops on his country's frontiers. There are bunkers dug into the ground in front of the border fence. Guards in white, winter camouflage patrol the area. But while it is impossible to know what forces might be concealed in the forest, this does not look like the place Ukraine would mount a sustained defence against any Russian invasion. This area is at the heart of what the historian Timothy Snyder calls the ""bloodlands"" of Eastern Europe where, he estimates, 14 million people were killed in the era of the dictators Adolph Hitler and Joseph Stalin. While the generation which knew the horrors of the 20th Century is fading, the stories of a landscape dotted with mass graves are part of the inherited memory here. The hope was that after the end of the Cold War in 1989, an age of peace might descend, that East and West would together remove the threat of mass conflict from the lives of the people here. History has not obliged. Further along the border, in the town of Slavutych, I met Valeryi and Galyna Sulimov who have been married for 40 years. He is a Ukrainian and she is Russian. They worked at the nearby Chernobyl nuclear plant until the reactor explosion in 1986 that caused an environmental catastrophe and claimed the lives of 100 people, among them many friends of the couple. Galyna was on duty that day but was sent home early before the explosion, because it was her birthday. They moved to Slavutych soon after it was built as a ""model"" Soviet town to house those evacuated from the radiation zone around Chernobyl. Each neighbourhood of neat apartment blocks or small wooden houses still bears their old Soviet era names: Armenia quarter, Estonia quarter and many more. There is a monument on the wide, central square on which the faces of the dead of Chernobyl are etched. Close by is a mural devoted to the civilian casualties of war, depicting the horrors of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in 1945 and the bombing of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War. This was to be the place where life would start again. But for Valeriy and Galyna, this present crisis has caused deep wounds in their personal world. There are arguments with their relatives in Russia. Their daughter lives there along with Galyna's extended family. ""I think it is a disaster. It changes our lives dramatically,"" says Valeriy. He cannot see a time of friendship between Russia and Ukraine returning. Galyna nods in agreement. Her answer highlights the intimate pain caused by big politics: ""The situation is so unreal. I can't believe my neighbours could come to my house and destroy it. I can't believe it. It's impossible!"" Her hope is that one day in the future Ukraine and Russia will share democratic values. Maybe then the divisions can be healed. Seen from the border, where rumours of war fly back and forth, it seems an optimistic hope.

Olivier Hoslet/ Pool via REUTERS PARIS, Nov 24 (Reuters) - The European Union must make it clear to Russia that there would be a high price to pay if it acted against Ukraine, Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas told Reuters on Wednesday, urging the bloc to quickly agree on how to deter Moscow. The increase of military activity on both sides follows weeks of rising tension that have raised the risk of war between the two ex-Soviet neighbours, even though Moscow denies aggressive intent and Western intelligence sources have told Reuters they do not see any invasion as imminent. ""We share the concern about the Russian military build-up around the Ukrainian border,"" Kallas said in an interview after talks in Paris with French President Emmanuel Macron. ""It is therefore very important that we are clear on the European side that the price of taking any steps towards Ukraine will be so high that it will act as a deterrent and make Russia reconsider."" She said there was a narrow window for the EU and the United States to agree on a common deterrent because the migrant crisis on the Belarus-Polish border, Germany's current lack of a government and France's approach to a presidential election could be the ""perfect storm"" for Russian President Vladimir Putin to test the EU's resolve. Kallas said there were still plenty of tools in the box regarding sanctions that could make Putin think twice. Estonia shares a border with Russia and last week summoned 1,700 reserve soldiers for an unannounced military exercise which includes installing a razor wire barrier along 40 km of its border with Russia. Kallas said that having seen fellow Baltic states Latvia and Lithuania react with toughened border security facing Belarus after migrants were pushed across the Belarusian frontier into Poland, Tallinn did not want to be caught out. ""If this is a kind of weapon that someone has in mind to use  against us, then we are making the preparations."" There were no signs at this stage of any threat to Estonia's border or of migrants being shuffled towards Estonia through Russia, Kallas said. Estonia has no border with Belarus.

Go , Lukashenko tells migrants at Polish border",English,United States,"BRUZGI, Belarus/MOSCOW, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko told migrants stranded at the border with Poland on Friday that his country would help them to return home if they wanted but would not force them. Thousands of migrants are stuck on the European Union's eastern frontier, in what the EU says is a crisis Minsk  engineered by distributing Belarusian visas in the Middle East, flying them in and pushing them across the border. But Lukashenko said it was the EU that deliberately provoked a humanitarian crisis that needed to be resolved and he told the migrants he would not play politics with their fate. In his first public appearance at the border since the start of the crisis, Lukashenko met migrants at a warehouse turned into shelter and told them they were free to head west or go home as they chose. An Iraqi teenager told Lukashenko she could not return home and hoped to continue on to Europe. ""We won't only hope,"" Lukashenko answered. ""We will work together on your dream."" Lukashenko said no-one would be coerced. ""If you want to go westwards, we won't detain you, choke you, beat you,"" he said as hundreds of migrants applauded. ""It's up to you. Go through. Go."" He added: ""We won't in any circumstances detain you, tie your hands and load you on planes to send you home if you don't want that."" 'HYBRID WAR' Poland and other EU nations say the crisis is part of a ""hybrid war"" Minsk is waging in retaliation for EU sanctions imposed in response to Lukashenko's crushing of protests against his disputed re-election last year and is designed to destabilise the bloc. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko speaks to migrants as he visits the transport and logistics centre Bruzgi on the Belarusian-Polish border, in the Grodno region, Belarus November 26, 2021. REUTERS/Kacper Pempel The EU has agreed on new sanctions in response to the border crisis, which diplomats in Brussels say should be approved and adopted in early December. Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, bearing the brunt of the crisis, have deployed thousands of border guards, soldiers and police to seal the border and push back migrants attempting to cross over from Belarus. Lithuania on Friday said it could close its border crossings if more migrants attempted to cross from Belarus in trucks. Belarus has begun to fly some migrants home, but has said it is waiting for an answer from the EU on its demand that Germany should accept 2,000 stranded at the border, which the EU has rejected and Germany has denied agreeing to it. On Friday, two planes brought hundreds of Iraqis back from Belarus to Erbil, capital of Iraq's Kurdish autonomous region. Two more flights were expected on Nov. 26-27, the TASS news agency reported. Warsaw has said the repatriation of migrants marked a change of tactics rather than a genuine attempt at de-escalation and Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, touring European capitals this week to rally support for a tough response, raised the possibility of further sanctions if the crisis escalated. Poland and Lithuania continue to report crossing attempts by migrants who are increasingly desperate with the onset of winter conditions. Polish authorities also reported unrest at one of the detention centres set up for migrants who made their way into the country. The issue has exacerbated strife between Russia and the EU, whose ties have been at post-Cold War lows since Moscow's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who helped Lukashenko ride out mass street protests after last year's election, has also backed Belarus in its most recent standoff with the EU.

S . troops to guard against Russia threat,English,United States,"Latvian President Egils Levits and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg attend a news conference in Riga, Latvia November 29, 2021. REUTERS/Ints Kalnins ADAZI MILITARY BASE, Latvia, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Latvia needs a permanent U.S. military presence to deter Russia and wants to boost its defences with U.S. Patriot missiles, Defence Minister Artis Pabriks said on Monday as NATO's chief visited allied troops in the Baltic country. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was due to arrive in  Latvia's capital Riga late on Monday before a meeting on Tuesday with 29 NATO counterparts. The alliance is alarmed by a Russian  military build-up on Ukraine's borders. ""We need additional international assistance,"" Pabriks told Reuters. ""We would like to have a permanent United States (military) presence in our country. And sea and air defence means basically going down to such systems as Patriot (surface-to-air missiles)."" NATO troops were rehearsing battle skills in a snowy Latvian woodland with camouflaged tanks and live rounds, with 1,500 troops seeking to stop an attack on Riga by disrupting and stalling the unidentified adversary's advance north of the city. ""Deterrence is critical,"" said Canadian Lieutenant Colonel John Benson, commander of the NATO battlegroup in Latvia. Prompted by Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and Moscow's support for separatists in eastern Ukraine, NATO has deployed four multinational battalion-size battlegroups to defend Poland and the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia since July 2017. Moscow says it has no intention of invading the Baltics or Poland and accuses NATO of destabilising Europe by moving troops closer to Russia's borders. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said there was ""no imminent threat"" against NATO. In May, Russia amassed 100,000 troops on its border with Ukraine, the highest number since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, Western officials say. NATO says there was another large military build-up on Ukraine's border this month. The Baltic states are seen as NATO's most vulnerable flank as they are linked to the alliance's main territory only by a land corridor of around 60 km (37 miles) between Poland and Lithuania known as the Suwalki gap. Military experts warn that Russia, via Belarus, might capture the gap, gaining a land corridor to its heavily fortified exclave of Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea. U.S. troops are stationed in Germany but might not reach the Baltics fast enough in the event of such an attack, experts say. ""We have revisionism at this moment going on in Russia ... from that perspective we cannot be late here,"" Pabriks said, referring to a statement by Russian President Vladimir Putin that he would reverse the collapse of the Soviet Union if he had a chance to alter modern Russian history.

Snam/Handout via REUTERS LONDON/OSLO Nov 22 (Reuters) - Consumers in the European Union and Britain face further gas price spikes this winter as flows of Russian gas via major transit routes are proving too little, too late. The new Nord Stream 2 pipeline running from Russia to Europe might have eased a tight market. But it has faced more delays as German certification has been suspended, amid opposition to the whole project from the United States and some Europeans. This year's power price shock has pushed several European and British energy suppliers out of business, as they cannot always pass on price rises to customers. Britain's Bulb, with 6% domestic market share, was the latest to go bust.  read more Sky-high electricity costs have forced some power-hungry industries to curtail production and European consumers are now paying more for home heating as winter approaches, adding to wider inflationary pressures. Benchmark European gas prices this year surged as much as 700% by October and British prices climbed 500% or so as global economies recovered from the pandemic and sucked in gas, particularly Asia nations, while European stocks are low. European gas  was up more than 300% this year on Monday and the British benchmark  was up about 250%. Prices eased when President Vladimir Putin said in October Russia would boost gas supplies to record levels, raising hopes that bumper flows would ward off supply shortages. But flows through major pipelines, such as Yamal which runs to Germany via Belarus and Poland, have not ramped up as much as hoped and there has been no sign of extra capacity booked at auction on other routes, including those via Ukraine. ""I wouldn't rule out a return to the record highs of October if you look at how short the market is and limited Russian flows,"" Refinitiv analyst Wayne Bryan said. State-owned Gazprom (GAZP.MM), which has a monopoly on Russian gas exports by pipeline, says it is meeting all its long-term contracts. European companies contacted by Reuters confirmed contractual obligations had been met. But supplies to the spot market, which many domestic gas providers rely on for their supplies, remain low. Refinitiv Eikon data shows daily flows were barely changed in September, October and so far in November from a year ago via the three main routes from Russia to Europe, namely the Yamal route, Nord Stream 1 which runs directly to Germany, and the pipeline network crossing Ukraine. COLD SNAP FEARS Volumes are slightly higher than the average for November 2020, when economic shutdowns due to the pandemic limited demand, and are 40% lower than the average for November 2019. Renewables, such as wind and solar which account for a growing portion of European power supplies, are not guaranteed to be able to fill the gap in supplies of electricity in order to ease demand on gas-fired generation. ""If flows don't pick up and there is a cold snap, or low wind speeds, we could see crazy prices again. We are living hand to mouth,"" a gas trader said. The suspension of the certification for Nord Stream 2 adds to market jitters as demand rises during Europe's main heating season, running from Oct. 1 until the end of March.  read more Once German certification is secured, the European Commission still has to sign off on the project. It will have two more months to do this. That could mean the project is unlikely to start commercial gas flows before the third quarter, said Energy Aspects analyst Trevor Sikorski. ""It raises issues about peak supply, meaning we could see very high prices and disruptions of gas supply to industry, particularly if there are a number of cold spells making the winter colder than normal,"" he said. Europe gas stocks remain well below average. Storage sites in northwest Europe controlled by Gazprom held about 41 terrawatt hours (TWh) on Nov. 17, Refinitiv Eikon data showed. The average figure was 113 TWh for the same day in 2017-2020.  read more ""Since Nov. 9 injections at Gazprom-controlled storage within Europe have averaged only 5 million cubic metres/day, which is quite insignificant,"" said James Huckstepp, manager  EMEA gas analytics at S&P Global Platts. Asian countries have sucked in supplies of liquefied natural gas (LNG), driving up prices for LNG shipments and adding to Europe's challenge in rebuilding stocks.  read more ""The JKM (Japan-Korea-Marker Asian benchmark) has continued to price at sufficient premiums to maintain LNG flows into that area at the expense of Europe,"" Sikorski said ""A colder than normal winter – likely given La Nina weather patterns – will likely mean that little incremental LNG will be available,"" he said.

The 33-year-old journalist often calls his family from Philadelphia, where he’s attending an English course, and recently joined others in the city’s Ukrainian community at a rally calling for peace back home. “My 5-year-old daughter asks my wife why Russians want to kill Ukrainians,” Opoka said about his loved ones, who live in the western city of Lviv. “I’m frustrated and also worried about them.” Religious leaders and members of the Ukrainian diaspora in the United States are growing increasingly concerned over the  threat of a dramatic escalation of the nearly decade-old conflict and have stepped up efforts to show support for family members and their Eastern European homeland. That support ranges from offering spiritual succor during special prayer services and maintaining charitable donations to organizing demonstrations and full-throated institutional declarations opposing Moscow’s actions amid the biggest security crisis between Russia and the West since the Cold War. Moscow, which has more than 100,000 troops deployed near Ukraine, insists it has no plans to attack and said Tuesday that some of its troops had pulled back from the area.  But a U.S. defense official said Russian troops were moving toward, not away from, the Ukrainian border, and Western officials warn an invasion could happen at any moment. “It’s a stressor for all of us here … because of the danger that it will be a bloody mess,” said the Rev. Taras Lonchyna, pastor of St. Josaphat Ukrainian Catholic Church in Trenton, New Jersey. “Our parishioners have contact with their families. ... They’re not only concerned about COVID but about the war.” St. Josaphat parishioner Myroslava Kucharska said she talks daily with her two sons and four grandchildren who live in the southern city of Mykolaiv and in Kyiv, the capital. “I tell my sons: ‘Be ready, be ready,’” Kucharska said. “We’re praying with tears in our eyes. … We know what war means.” Holy Trinity Ukrainian Catholic Church in Carnegie, Pennsylvania, where most in the congregation have relatives in western Ukraine, has responded to the crisis by keeping parishioners up to date on the situation and encouraging prayer, including at a recent service focused on peace. Should the need arise, the Rev. Jason Charron said, the church is prepared to provide humanitarian help as it has in recent years for the country’s war-torn east. After emerging from decades of communist Soviet rule, Ukrainian Catholics are prepared to resist any invasion that would threaten to put them under the Kremlin’s thumb again, Charron said: “For them, the repression of their culture and their history is tied with the repression of their faith.” His wife, Ukrainian native Halyna Charron, said family members and friends throughout that her home country are surprised and encouraged that the West is now devoting so much attention to Ukraine after years of paying little notice. It’s in America’s interest to do so, she said, because the United States was signatory to a 1994 pact in which Ukraine agreed to give up Soviet-era nuclear weapons on its soil in return for Russia promising to respect Ukraine’s territorial integrity. “I understand some Americans will say, ‘Oh, what’s the big deal? Ukraine is somewhere far,’” she said. “But once you are in that position of power and you sign papers, you have to honor those promises.” In Pittsburgh this past weekend, members of St. Vladimir Ukrainian Orthodox Church were selling homemade soup in a “Souper Bowl” fundraiser to help feed people in need back home. In past years’ fundraisers, customers would often ask where the country is. But in 2022, with constant headlines about the crisis, they no longer have to ask and are often eager to help. The Very Rev. John Haluszczak, the church’s pastor, said parishioners are worried about relatives and others in Ukraine, such as the children and staffers at a church-supported orphanage. “We’re not praying for winning or losing but pretty much for peace,” he said. The Most Rev. Borys Gudziak, metropolitan archbishop of the Ukrainian Catholic Church in Philadelphia for the United States, said there are daily prayers for peace being said in each of the 200 or so Ukrainian Catholic parishes in the U.S., along with regular collections for orphans and wounded soldiers. In recent weeks the Ukrainian diaspora in America has also staged a number of demonstrations including a Philadelphia rally in late January of religious leaders and the faithful, supported by the Belarusian, Lithuanian, Latvian, Polish, Estonian, Georgian, Uzbek and other diasporas of the city’s greater metro area. “The Ukrainian Catholic community and the general Ukrainian community in the U.S. has been involved in this in a very regular way” Gudziak said of the eight years of fighting in eastern Ukraine in which more than 14,000 people have died. “Now with this new danger, a danger of being in further invasion, there is heightened awareness.” A Russian invasion could cause thousands of deaths and unleash a refugee crisis with millions forced to flee, Gudziak added in an interview via videoconference from Lviv, where he was attending a meeting, “How many schools, how many hospitals, how many bridges and roads, how many churches, synagogues, mosques have to be destroyed? How many more orphans need to be created? How many people have to be driven into homelessness and poverty?” said Gudziak, who also serves as head of the department of external church relations for the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. Ukraine’s Greek Catholic Church is a minority Eastern Rite church that uses the Byzantine or Greek liturgy and is loyal to the pope. Last month Pope Francis called for a day of prayer over the Ukraine crisis and for political talks prioritizing “human brotherhood instead of partisan interests.” The Holy See’s secretary of state phoned the head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church on Monday to express the Vatican’s solidarity. The Council of Bishops of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA, meanwhile, released a statement headlined, “Pray for Ukraine.” “The scare and intimidation tactics with the presence of the armed vehicles and over a hundred thousand of soldiers around the borders of Ukraine combined with systematic cyber attacks at all levels of life in Ukraine can only be interpreted as terroristic threats that target innocent lives of Ukrainian citizens,” it said. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File Photo MOSCOW, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Russia's Gazprom (GAZP.MM) declined to book extra capacity to ship more gas to Europe from January at auctions on Tuesday, a step that would have helped ease prices in a market haunted by worries about Moscow's intentions. The Kremlin said Russia remained committed to start pumping additional gas to Europe once domestic storage tanks were replenished, in line with an order given to Gazprom last week by President Vladimir Putin. Russia provides a third of Europe's gas and its supply intentions are critical at a time when spot prices across the continent have surged, hitting households and businesses alike. Moscow has said it is meeting its contractual obligations in full though the International Energy Agency and some European politicians have suggested Moscow can do more. Gazprom, however, decided against booking additional gas transit capacity via Ukraine and Poland to Europe for January-September 2022, in a sign it has no plans to supply more than its contractual volumes, at least via these two routes. Moscow denies it is withholding supplies to exert pressure on German regulators to approve gas shipments through the new Nord Stream 2 pipeline across the Baltic Sea to Germany. Putin has said gas could start flowing through the new pipeline from Russia within a day of approval being granted. The German regulator has until early January to certify the pipeline but may make its decision earlier. Once it has made its recommendation, it goes to the European Commission, which has another two months to respond.  read more Analysts at Jefferies said in a note that the question now was whether Russia would only make additional gas available through Nord Stream 2, which was built despite U.S. sanctions on companies involved in its construction. Dmitry Marinchenko, senior director at Fitch ratings agency, said Nord Stream 2 appeared to be the reason why Gazprom had held back from booking more gas transit capacity through Ukraine or via the Yamal pipeline across Belarus. ""Gazprom is presumably betting on Nord Stream 2 coming online fairly soon - and does not want to assume additional obligations as of now as the Ukraine transit route and the Yamal-Europe pipeline are likely to be used as balancing routes once Nord Stream 2 is up and running,"" he said. Gazprom did not reply to a Reuters request for comment. Gas levels in storage controlled by Gazprom in Europe remain at about a third of levels a year ago. Putin has given orders to fill the sites from Nov. 8, when domestic re-stocking is expected to end, and the Kremlin said that remained the plan. Benchmark natural gas prices in Europe  have surged some 250% this year, and at one point in early October spiked eightfold as demand shot higher in economies rebounding strongly from last year's pandemic-induced recessions. Strong demand in Asia and lower-than-expected renewable energy production have also put a squeeze on the market, but traders have said Gazprom's decision not to book more capacity on gas transit pipelines to Europe has made the situation worse. Russia's Yamal-Europe pipeline, meanwhile, which normally sends gas westwards through Poland to Germany, was working in reverse mode for a fourth straight day on Tuesday and was expected to stay that way until at least Wednesday, according to data from German pipeline operator Gascade. Gas flows into Germany at the Mallnow metering point on the Polish border stopped on Saturday and have not resumed, the data showed. Instead, gas is heading back east across Poland. The reversal, which neither Gazprom, Poland nor Germany have explained, has added to market nerves. A spokesperson for German utility RWE (RWEG.DE), one of Gazprom's big customers, said: ""Our existing supply agreements with Gazprom Export are being adhered to; we are not cut (off)."" Ronald Smith, senior oil and gas analyst at BCS brokerage, said Russia appeared intent on filling Nord Stream 2 (NS2) with gas taken from the Yamal-Europe pipeline. Last month, Gazprom booked only a third of the total additional capacity offered by Poland for November.  read more ""If NS2 isn't soon approved for launch, however, Gazprom may be forced to request additional, more traditional transit capacity on Yamal-Europe,"" he said.

214,reuters.com,2021-11-12 08:00:00,https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSKBN2HW12H,Neighbours of Belarus say migrant crisis risks military clash,English,United States,"KAPCIAMIESTIS, Lithuania/WARSAW Nov 11 (Reuters) - Countries bordering Belarus on Thursday warned the migrant crisis on the European Union's eastern borders could escalate into a military confrontation while Ukraine said it would deploy thousands more troops to reinforce its frontier. Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia said Belarus posed serious threats to European security by deliberately escalating its ""hybrid attack"" using migrants to retaliate for EU sanctions. ""This increases the possibility of provocations and serious incidents that could also spill over into the military domain,"" a joint statement by the countries' defence ministers said. The Belarus defence ministry earlier said that in response to a build-up of Polish military forces near the border it would be obliged it to take ""appropriate response measures"", both independently and together with its strategic ally, Russia. While not an EU member, Ukraine, wary of becoming another flashpoint, announced drills and the deployment of 8,500 additional troops and police officers to the country's long northern border with Belarus. Migrants stranded inside Belarus threw rocks and branches at Polish border guards and used logs to try to break down a razor wire fence overnight in new attempts to force their way into the EU, the authorities in Warsaw said. The EU says Minsk is encouraging thousands fleeing war-torn parts of the world to try to cross its borders and may impose new sanctions on Belarus and airlines ferrying the migrants as soon as Monday. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko threatened to retaliate, including by shutting down the transit of Russian natural gas via Belarus, although there was no immediate response from Russia, its ally and financial backer. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow will try to help Europe weather an energy crunch and is hoping German authorities will soon certify the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that will carry more Russian gas to Europe's biggest economy. Moscow reacted angrily in the past when Ukraine, another transit country, disrupted gas supplies to the West, but Lukashenko has pushed back against its wishes at times while accepting loans and subsidised energy. Minsk said two Russian strategic bombers were patrolling Belarusian airspace for a second day in a show of support. In comments carried by local media, Lukashenko also said there were attempts to transfer weapons to the migrants, but neither provided any evidence nor said who was behind what he called a provocation. The Kremlin said Russia had nothing to do with tensions on the border and suggested the presence of heavily armed people on both sides was a source of concern. It also said Putin held a second phone call in two days with  German Chancellor Angela Merkel telling her the EU should talk to Belarus about the crisis. Polish soldiers patrol Poland/Belarus border near Kuznica, Poland, in this photograph released by the Polish Ministry of Defence, November 11, 2021. MON/Handout via REUTERS The Kremlin earlier rejected as ""crazy"" a suggestion in a media report that Russia's flag carrier Aeroflot could be targeted with sanctions. The EU has not said which airlines will be included, but Turkey also responded angrily to a report that its flag carrier Turkish Airlines might be affected. ""We reject efforts to portray Turkey, which is not a party to this issue, as part of the problem,"" the Turkish foreign ministry said in a statement. Trapped between two borders, the migrants have endured freezing weather in makeshift camps. Poland has reported at least seven migrant deaths in the months-long crisis and other migrants have expressed fear they would die. None of around 150 migrants gathered near the town of Bialowieza managed to breach the border, with 468 attempted crossings on Wednesday, according to the Polish border guard service. Neighbouring Lithuania, which like Poland has imposed a state of emergency on the border, also reported new crossing attempts. It said it had asked the United Nations to discuss creating a ""humanitarian corridor"" from the border zone to help the migrants return to their home countries, saying social media accounts showed some people trapped there wanted to go back. The Iraqi embassy in Moscow on Thursday said it was ready to help evacuate any Iraqi nationals who wanted to return home from Belarus, inviting them to contact it by WhatsApp or email. EU foreign ministers may approve more Belarus sanctions on Monday that could include individuals and companies, according to one diplomat. The bloc's executive commission said airlines that bring migrants would be on the list and two diplomats said the main airport in Belarus was also being considered. The EU accuses Lukashenko of manufacturing the crisis in revenge for earlier sanctions in response to a violent crackdown on mass street protests against his rule in 2020. Germany said he must be countered with all strength. ""Lukashenko is making an inhumane power play with people,"" German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, who is set to become the country's next chancellor, said. Lukashenko and Russia have said the EU was not living up to its humanitarian values by preventing migrants from crossing. Large groups fleeing conflicts and poverty in the Middle East and elsewhere started flying to Minsk this spring with the help of Belarusian travel agencies. Many have travelled to the border with Poland, Lithuania or Latvia and tried to cross into the EU, sometimes using wire cutters they say were given to them by Belarusian border guards.

185,bbc.co.uk,2022-02-11 08:00:00,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60342814,Ukraine tensions : Joe Biden says US citizens should leave Ukraine now,English,United Kingdom,"US President Joe Biden has called on all American citizens remaining in Ukraine to leave the country immediately, citing increased threats of Russian military action. Mr Biden said he would not send troops to rescue Americans if Moscow invades Ukraine. Several other countries, including the UK, also urged their citizens to leave. Russia has repeatedly denied any plans to invade Ukraine despite massing more than 100,000 troops near the border. But it has just begun massive military drills with neighbouring Belarus, and Ukraine has accused Russia of blocking its access to the sea. The Kremlin says it wants to enforce ""red lines"" to make sure that its former Soviet neighbour does not join Nato. ""American citizens should leave now,"" Mr Biden told NBC News. ""We're dealing with one of the largest armies in the world. It's a very different situation and things could go crazy quickly."" Asked whether there was a scenario that could prompt him to send troops to rescue fleeing Americans, Mr Biden replied: ""There's not. That's a world war when Americans and Russia start shooting at one another. We're in a very different world than we've ever been."" A host of other countries, including the Netherlands, Japan and South Korea have also told their citizens to leave Ukraine. In its warning Latvia cited ""a serious threat to security posed by Russia"". US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, on a visit to Australia, said on Friday that ""an invasion could begin at any time, and to be clear, that includes during the Olympics"". The Winter Olympics in China are scheduled to end on 20 February. I’m staying in Ukraine, for now: Watch US citizen and English teacher Juan Tec explain why Diplomatic efforts are under way to defuse the current crisis over Ukraine. UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace warned his counterpart in Moscow that a Russian invasion of Ukraine would have ""tragic consequences"" for both countries. But Sergei Shogiu said growing military tensions in Europe were ""not our fault"". The current tensions come eight years after Russia annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula. Since then, Ukraine's military has been locked in a war with Russian-backed rebels in eastern areas near Russia's borders. Meanwhile, Ukraine accused Russia of blocking its access to the sea as Russia prepared for naval exercises. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the Sea of Azov had been completely blocked and the Black Sea almost fully cut off by Russian forces. Russia's naval exercises were due to take place next week in the two seas to the south of Ukraine, the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. However, Ukraine's Border Guard Service said on Friday that Russia had told them it had cancelled its drill in the Sea of Azov, an internal sea bordered by both Russia and Ukraine. Ukraine's port authority later said restrictions there had been lifted. Russian naval drills were already taking place in Crimea on Friday, while 10 days of military exercises continued in Belarus, to the north of Ukraine. There are fears that if Russia tries to invade Ukraine, the exercises put the Russian military close to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, making an attack on the city easier. Russia says its troops will return to their permanent bases after the drills end. Ukraine has launched its own 10-day military exercises, though officials have given few details. Moscow says it cannot accept that Ukraine - a former Soviet republic with deep social and cultural ties with Russia - could one day join the Western defence alliance Nato and has demanded that this be ruled out. Russia has been backing a bloody armed rebellion in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region since 2014. Some 14,000 people - including many civilians - have died in fighting since then. There is some suggestion that a renewed focus on the so-called Minsk agreements - which sought to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine - could be used as a basis to defuse the current crisis. Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany backed the accords in 2014-2015. Are you in Ukraine and affected by what's happening? Are you a US citizen in Ukraine?

The US rejected a key Moscow demand that Nato rule out Ukraine joining the defence alliance - but insisted it was offering Russia a ""diplomatic path"". President Biden says Russia could invade next month. German intelligence says Russia is prepared to attack but has not yet decided to do so. Russia denies it is planning an attack. But on Friday Mr Putin told French President Emmanuel Macron the stand-off had not been resolved. ""US and Nato responses did not take account of such key Russian concerns as preventing Nato expansion, non-deployment of strike weapons systems near Russian borders, or returning the alliance's military potential and infrastructure in Europe to positions existing in 1997,"" a Kremlin readout of the call said. It is Mr Putin's first comment on the crisis after the US rejected Russia's main demand. He told Mr Macron he would study the US counter-proposals closely before deciding on any further action. France said the two leaders had agreed on the need to de-escalate and Mr Macron had told Mr Putin that Russia must respect the sovereignty of its neighbouring states. Also on Friday Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appeared to downplay Mr Biden's warning of a February invasion. He told reporters that tensions were not currently escalating, saying: ""We don't need panic."" Mr Zelensky said Ukraine should not be the subject of a deal between Mr Biden and Mr Putin and should instead be involved in talks. And he said moves by the UK and US to pull some embassy staff and their relatives out of Ukraine had been a mistake. Meanwhile the head of Germany's foreign intelligence service said Russia was prepared to attack Ukraine, but had not yet decided whether to do so. ""I believe that the decision to attack has not yet been made,"" Bruno Kahl told Reuters news agency. And Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance was ready to increase its presence in eastern Europe to demonstrate its resolve. Mr Stoltenberg said Russia was deploying thousands of combat-ready troops and missile systems into Belarus, which also borders Ukraine. Russia last month made wide-ranging security demands from the West, including that: The US and Nato responded by saying Ukraine had the right to choose its own allies but offered Russia talks on missile placements and other issues. In public, Russian officials insist that Nato is a danger to Russia's national security. I'm sceptical. I find it hard to believe that Moscow truly sees the alliance is a threat. Only 6% of Russia's borders touch Nato countries; the Kremlin has good relations with some Nato members, like Italy and Hungary; it's even sold weapons systems to Nato member Turkey. Plus, there is no sign whatsoever of Ukraine, Georgia or other former Soviet states being accepted into Nato in the near future. So why is the Kremlin fixating on the alliance? Partly for domestic reasons: to get the Russian people to unite against an alleged external enemy. But also, perhaps, as an excuse to use this moment to reshape the European security order to Moscow's benefit; to re-establish Russia's sphere of influence and try to rewrite the results of the Cold War. Read more of Steve Rosenberg's analysis If Russia were to invade Ukraine, it would not be the first time. Russia annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula in 2014. It is also backing rebels who seized large swathes of the eastern Donbas region soon afterwards, and some 14,000 people have died in fighting there.

The siege escalated a crisis along the European Union’s eastern border that has been simmering for months. Poland’s interior ministry said it had rebuffed the illegal invasion and claimed the situation was under control. The Defense Ministry posted a video showing an armed Polish officer using a chemical spray through a fence at men who were trying to cut the razor wire. Some migrants threw objects at police. Video footage from Belarusian media showed people using long wooden poles or branches to try to get past a border fence as police helicopters circled overhead. Defense Ministry video taken later Monday showed the migrants settling in for the night by the border, having put up scores of tents and cooking meals. “A coordinated attempt to massively enter the territory of the Republic of Poland by migrants used by Belarus for the hybrid attacks against Poland has just begun,” a spokesman for Poland’s security forces, Stanislaw Zaryn, said in a statement. Noting that it’s also NATO’s eastern border, Zaryn stressed that the “large groups of migrants ... are fully controlled by the Belarusian security services and army.” He accused Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko of acting to destabilize Poland and other EU countries to pressure the bloc into dropping its sanctions on Minsk. Those sanctions were put into place after Belarus cracked down brutally on democracy protests. Piotr Mueller, Poland’s government spokesperson, said 3,000 to 4,000 migrants were next to the Polish border on the Belarusian side. Polish border officials said the border crossing in Kuznica, in the northeast, will be closed early Tuesday. There was no way to independently verify what was happening. Journalists have limited ability to operate in Belarus and a state of emergency in Poland is keeping reporters and human rights workers out of the border area. The massing of people at the border appeared to rev up the crisis that has being going on for months in which the autocratic regime of Belarus has encouraged migrants from the Mideast and elsewhere to illegally enter the European Union, at first through Lithuania and Latvia and now primarily through Poland. Anton Bychkovsky, spokesman for Belarus’ State Border Guard Committee, told The Associated Press that the migrants at the border are seeking to “exercise their right to apply for refugee status in the EU.” Bychkovsky insisted they “are not a security threat.” But the massive group was viewed as a threat by Poland and other European countries, including Germany — the main destination for many. Steffen Seibert, German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s spokesman, told reporters Monday that “the Belarusian regime is acting as a human trafficker.” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called on the bloc’s 27 nations to approve extended sanctions on the Belarusian authorities “responsible for this hybrid attack.” She said two top EU officials — EU Commission vice president Margaritis Schinas and EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell — will travel to the main countries of origin for the migrants to “ensure that they act to prevent their own nationals from falling into the trap set by the Belarusian authorities.” The EU said it hoped that Poland would finally accept help from Frontex, the bloc’s border agency, a step that Poland’s ruling nationalists have so far refused to do. Frontex would not comment Monday on the border situation. In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price expressed concern “with disturbing images and reports emanating from the Belarus-Poland border” and stressed that the U.S. “strongly condemns the Lukashenko regime’s political exploitation and coercion of vulnerable people and the regime’s callous and inhumane facilitation of irregular migration flows across its borders.” He said the U.S. was calling on “the regime to immediately halt its campaign of orchestrating and coercing irregular migrant flows across its borders into Europe” and warned that if the regime “refuses to respect its international obligations and commitments ... we will continue to pressure Lukashenko and will not lessen our calls for accountability.” Polish Defense Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said on Twitter that more than 12,000 soldiers have been deployed to the border and a volunteer Territorial Defense force was put on alert. He also posted video footage  of what appeared to be a large group of migrants in Belarus, near Kuznica. Polish ministers held an emergency meeting on the border crisis, with Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki writing on Facebook that Poland’s border is “sacred” and “not just a line on the map.” Poland’s deputy foreign minister, Pawel Jablonski held talks with Iraqi charge d’affaires Hussein al-Safi on ways of ending the migration crisis and thanked Iraq for having Belarus close its consulates in Baghdad and Irbil that were giving tourist visas to migrants. Meanwhile, in Poland’s EU neighbor Lithuania, officials were preparing for the possibility of a similar incursion, with the Interior Ministry proposing to declare an emergency situation. “We are getting ready for all possible scenarios,” said Rustamas Liubajevas, the head of Lithuania’s border guards. Since the summer, Poland and Lithuania have seen thousands of migrants from the Mideast and Africa trying to cross into the EU. Poland has sought to block the attempts or send those they catch back into Belarus. Belarusian political analyst Valery Karbalevich told the AP that the Moscow-backed Lukashenko regime seemed to be trying to use the migrants “to scare” the EU. “The largest attack of migrants on EU borders is taking place three days after Belarus and Russia signed a new agreement on military cooperation. The Kremlin is at least aware of the details of what’s happening,” Karbalevich said. ___ Daria Litvinova in Moscow, Yuras Karmanau in Kyiv, Ukraine, Jan M.

Amid a buildup of an estimated 100,000 Russian troops near the border with Ukraine and massive joint war games with Belarus, the Defense Ministry said it will also conduct maneuvers involving the bulk of Russia’s naval potential. “The drills are intended to practice navy and air force action to protect Russian national interests in the world’s oceans and to counter military threats to the Russian Federation,” the ministry said, adding that they will start this month and run through February. It said the exercise will involve over 140 warships and more than 60 aircraft, and will be conducted in both littoral waters and more distant “operationally important” areas including the Mediterranean, northeastern Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean. The ministry said several Russian warships are currently taking part in a joint exercise with China and Iran in the Gulf of Oman that began Tuesday and will last until the weekend. U.S. President Joe Biden said  Wednesday he thinks Russia will invade Ukraine and warned President Vladimir Putin that his country would pay a “dear price” in lives lost and a possible cutoff from the global banking system if it does. Moscow has repeatedly denied having plans to launch an offensive. But it has sought a set of security guarantees from the West that would exclude NATO’s expansion to Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations and the deployment of alliance weapons there. Washington and its allies firmly rejected Moscow’s demands in security talks last week but kept the door open to possible further talks on arms control and confidence-building measures to reduce the potential for hostilities. Amid the tensions, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Ukraine Wednesday to reassure it of Western support and met with his British, French and German counterparts in Berlin on Thursday to discuss Ukraine  and other security matters. Blinken is set to meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Geneva on Friday. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova alleged that Ukrainian and Western claims of an imminent Russian attack on Ukraine were a “cover for staging large-scale provocations of their own, including those of military character.” “They may have extremely tragic consequences for the regional and global security,” Zakharova said. She pointed to the delivery of weapons to Ukraine by British military transport planes in recent days, claiming that Ukraine perceives Western military assistance as a “carte blanche for a military operation in Donbas.” Donbas, located in eastern Ukraine, is under control of Russia-backed separatists who have fought Ukrainian forces for nearly eight years, a conflict that has killed more than 14,000 people. Ukraine said earlier this week that it has taken the delivery of anti-tank missiles from the U.K. It has rejected Moscow’s claims that it plans an offensive to reclaim control of separatist-held areas in the country’s eastern industrial heartland. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the U.S. threat to cut off Russia from the global banking system could encourage hawkish forces in Ukraine to use force to reclaim control of the rebel east. “It may implant false hopes in the hotheads of some representatives of the Ukrainian leadership who may decide to quietly restart a civil war in their country,” Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. In a move that further beefs up forces near Ukraine, Russia has sent an unspecified number of troops from its far east to its ally Belarus, which shares a border with Ukraine, for major war games that run through Feb. 20. Ukrainian officials have said Moscow could use Belarusian territory to launch a potential multi-pronged invasion. The head of the European Union’s executive arm, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen reiterated Thursday that the EU “will respond with massive economic and financial sanctions” if Russia invades Ukraine. “We hope an attack won’t happen, but if it does, we are prepared,” von der Leyen said during an online speech to the Davos business forum. ___ Vanessa Gera in Warsaw, Poland, and Lorne Cook in Brussels, contributed to this report.",western,1,701,95.1,52.83,34.86,7.43,28.04,32.24,79.32,54.49,41.51,6.28,1.85,0,0.29,0.14,0.57,0.57,4.42,12.98,8.13,0.86,14.98,5.28,1.14,4.99,0.14,10.84,5.99,3.71,7.85,1.43,0.57,5.85,8.56,0,8.27,1,2,0.86,2.28,0.29,2.28,0,4.28,1.43,2.85,1.14,0.29,0.86,0,0.71,0.14,0,11.41,7.42,1,0,2.28,0.43,2.85,4.14,0,0.14,0.29,0.57,6.28,3.71,2.43,0.14,3.42,0.43,0.29,2.14,1,0,0.86,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.14,0.14,0,0.29,0.86,0,0,0,0,1.28,0.14,1.57,11.27,0.43,1.14,9.27,0,0.14,0.14,3.71,3.71,3.14,3,0.29,0.29,0.14,0,0,14.12,4.56,3.85,0,0,1.14,4.56

REUTERS/Vasily Fedosenko/File Photo MOSCOW, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Russian natural gas flows through the Yamal-Europe pipeline to Germany eased on Thursday morning, data from German network operator Gascade showed, but gas prices dropped despite ongoing uncertainty over Russian supplies this winter. Gas prices rose this week after Germany's energy regulator suspended the approval process for Nord Stream 2, a major new pipeline built to bring Russian gas into Europe.  read more Flows via the Yamal-Europe pipeline into Germany at the Mallnow metering point on the Polish border were at an hourly volume of just below 11,800,000 kilowatt hours (kWh) by 1000 GMT on Thursday morning, down from around 12,300,000 kilowatt hours seen on Wednesday, the data showed. The pipeline is one of the major routes for Russian gas exports to Europe. Nominations for Thursday's volumes at the Velke Kapusany metering point on the Slovak-Ukraine border, another major route to Europe, were for 1.0 million megawatt hours or 94.4 million cubic metres, similar to previous days. Germany's decision to suspend certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline could delay its commissioning until March next year, sources told Reuters this week. The Kremlin declined to comment on the specific timing on Thursday. [nL1N2S80Y6] ""No one can or should interrupt the (German) regulator's work. The company (the Nord Stream 2) is fulfilling all bureaucratic formalities to get this certification process done,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.

The European benchmark TTF front-month contract  was down 3.70 euros at 91.80 euros per megawatt hour by 1020 GMT.

Putin welcomed Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko’s proposal to hold another round of military drills, saying that they could be held in February or March. Speaking during a meeting with Lukashenko in St. Petersburg, he added that military officials will coordinate details. Putin’s announcement comes amid a Russian troop buildup near Ukraine that raised Western fears of an invasion. Some officials in Ukraine have voiced concern that Russia may attack the country from Belarusian territory. Russia has denied having plans to attack its neighbor, but urged the U.S. and its allies to provide guarantees that NATO doesn’t expand to Ukraine or deploy its weapons there — demands the West has rejected. Russia and Belarus have a union agreement envisaging close political, economic and military ties, and Moscow has staunchly backed Lukashenko amid Western pressure. That pressure intensified after a brutal crackdown on domestic protests fueled by Lukashenko’s reelection to a sixth term in an August 2020 vote that the opposition and the West say was rigged. Tensions have escalated further since the summer over the arrival of thousands of migrants and refugees on Belarus’ border with EU member Poland. The EU has accused Lukashenko of retaliating for its sanctions by using desperate asylum-seekers as pawns and tricking them into trying to enter Poland. In a show of support for Lukashenko, Russia conducted massive war games with Belarus in September that involved 200,000 troops. In recent week, Moscow has repeatedly sent its nuclear capable bombers on patrol over Belarus in recent weeks. On Wednesday, Russian and Belarusian fighter jets jointly patrolled Belarus’ air space. Last month, Lukashenko said that Belarus would be ready to host Russian nuclear weapons. The Belarusian leader hasn’t elaborated on what kind of Russian atomic weapons Belarus would be willing to accommodate, but noted that the ex-Soviet nation has carefully preserved the necessary military infrastructure dating back to the time of the USSR. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has described Lukashenko’s offer as a “serious warning prompted by reckless Western policy.” ___ Yuras Karmanau contributed to this report from in Kyiv, Ukraine.",western,1,362,93.12,49.92,38.94,1,20.11,34.25,76.52,51.1,38.12,6.08,0.83,0,0,0,0.28,0.55,5.25,11.88,6.08,1.1,14.92,6.35,0.28,4.7,0.55,11.33,6.63,2.76,9.94,2.21,0.83,6.91,6.08,0,5.52,0.55,1.1,1.1,0.83,0.28,1.93,0,4.7,0.55,4.14,0.55,0,0.55,0.28,0,0,0,11.6,7.46,1.38,0.28,2.21,0.28,2.76,4.14,0,0,0,0.55,8.29,4.7,3.04,0.55,1.93,0.55,0.28,0.83,0.28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.55,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.55,0,2.76,10.77,0.28,1.1,9.12,0.28,0,0.28,5.25,2.49,3.04,1.93,0,0,0,0,0,13.54,5.52,3.31,0,0,2.21,2.49

Taken in mid-February, they illustrate that Ukraine remains surrounded on three sides - on its borders with both Russia and Belarus - by Russian military hardware and troop concentrations. Of particular concern is the presence of a new field hospital, at some distance to the rear at the Osipovichi training area in north-western Belarus. While this could be a legitimate part of any large scale field exercise it could also be an indication of expected battle casualties from an imminent conflict. Other troop concentrations and activity are considerably closer to Ukraine's borders. A military pontoon bridge over the Pripyat river was pictured on 15 February. It is less than less than 4 miles (6km) from Belarus's border with Ukraine. Analysts at London-based McKenzie Intelligence Services have highlighted the large staging area on the right bank of the river as an indicator of possible intent to move large numbers of vehicles. Some reports have suggested that the pontoon may have been removed. Another image is of self-propelled artillery, or large calibre guns mounted on a tank chassis, arrayed at Brestsky, which is about 30 miles (50km) from the border. A newly arrived unit of 20 anti-tank attack helicopters was pictured at Zyabrovka airfield, 19 miles (30km) from the border. McKenzie Intelligence analysts say that there are 12 probable Russian Hokum, and five probable Hind or Mi-28 Havoc helicopters. It is important to remember that Russia's current military presence of around 30,000 troops in Belarus, while alarming to both Ukraine and NATO, are part of joint, scheduled exercises that are due to conclude on February 20. So a key test of Moscow's intentions will come after that date when satellite images will reveal if the bulk of Russian forces there have remained or departed. There is nothing in these images that definitively proves that Russia is about to invade Ukraine. Russia continues to insists that this is not its intention and that any such suggestion is part of western propaganda. But NATO defence chiefs believe Russia now has sufficient forces in place around Ukraine to execute an invasion should President Putin give the order. The scale, magnitude and configuration of Russia's deployment close to Ukraine's borders is unprecedented with, for example, air defence units brought in from thousands of miles away in the east of Siberia. Under Putin's leadership Russia's military has undergone a dramatic transformation from the dark days of the 1990's following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Two things have happened that have made Russia's military a force to be reckoned with. Firstly, huge amounts of state money have been invested in modernising and upgrading troops, equipment, weapons, cyber and logistics - from the latest versions of cyber attacks to reorganising combat units into compact 'Tactical Battalion Groups' of around 800 troops supported by tanks, artillery and other arms. Secondly, Russian commanders and planners have spent the last seven years gaining valuable combat experience in Syria and eastern Ukraine. Their weapons have been tested on the battlefield and Russian commanders have learnt from earlier mistakes. Taken together, western analysts believe Moscow could, if it chose, maintain a sizable and threatening military presence around Ukraine's borders for weeks, if not months, to come.",western,1,562,91.56,27.44,60.41,12.74,23.42,33.99,80.07,56.23,43.95,4.63,0.36,0,0,0,0,0.36,4.27,12.99,6.41,3.74,16.01,7.3,2.85,5.52,0.53,11.57,5.52,6.58,5.69,1.25,0.36,4.09,9.61,0.18,9.43,2.14,1.25,0.89,2.14,0.36,3.56,0.18,3.2,1.25,1.96,0.18,0,0.18,0.18,0,0,0,4.98,3.02,0.18,0,1.25,0,0.71,1.78,0,0,0,0,4.63,2.49,1.42,0.71,2.85,0,0,2.67,0.53,0,0.89,0.53,0.18,0.18,0,0,0,0,0.18,0,0,0.53,0,0.18,0,0.18,0.36,0,3.38,12.1,0.53,1.07,9.25,1.6,0,0,4.45,3.56,3.74,1.25,0,0,0,0,0,14.41,4.27,4.63,0,0,2.49,3.02
213,reuters.com,2021-11-11 08:00:00,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2HW12H,Neighbours of Belarus say migrant crisis risks military clash,English,United States,"KAPCIAMIESTIS, Lithuania/WARSAW Nov 11 (Reuters) - Countries bordering Belarus on Thursday warned the migrant crisis on the European Union's eastern borders could escalate into a military confrontation while Ukraine said it would deploy thousands more troops to reinforce its frontier. Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia said Belarus posed serious threats to European security by deliberately escalating its ""hybrid attack"" using migrants to retaliate for EU sanctions. ""This increases the possibility of provocations and serious incidents that could also spill over into the military domain,"" a joint statement by the countries' defence ministers said. The Belarus defence ministry earlier said that in response to a build-up of Polish military forces near the border it would be obliged it to take ""appropriate response measures"", both independently and together with its strategic ally, Russia. While not an EU member, Ukraine, wary of becoming another flashpoint, announced drills and the deployment of 8,500 additional troops and police officers to the country's long northern border with Belarus. Migrants stranded inside Belarus threw rocks and branches at Polish border guards and used logs to try to break down a razor wire fence overnight in new attempts to force their way into the EU, the authorities in Warsaw said. The EU says Minsk is encouraging thousands fleeing war-torn parts of the world to try to cross its borders and may impose new sanctions on Belarus and airlines ferrying the migrants as soon as Monday. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko threatened to retaliate, including by shutting down the transit of Russian natural gas via Belarus, although there was no immediate response from Russia, its ally and financial backer. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow will try to help Europe weather an energy crunch and is hoping German authorities will soon certify the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that will carry more Russian gas to Europe's biggest economy. Moscow reacted angrily in the past when Ukraine, another transit country, disrupted gas supplies to the West, but Lukashenko has pushed back against its wishes at times while accepting loans and subsidised energy. Minsk said two Russian strategic bombers were patrolling Belarusian airspace for a second day in a show of support. In comments carried by local media, Lukashenko also said there were attempts to transfer weapons to the migrants, but neither provided any evidence nor said who was behind what he called a provocation. The Kremlin said Russia had nothing to do with tensions on the border and suggested the presence of heavily armed people on both sides was a source of concern. It also said Putin held a second phone call in two days with  German Chancellor Angela Merkel telling her the EU should talk to Belarus about the crisis. Polish soldiers patrol Poland/Belarus border near Kuznica, Poland, in this photograph released by the Polish Ministry of Defence, November 11, 2021. MON/Handout via REUTERS The Kremlin earlier rejected as ""crazy"" a suggestion in a media report that Russia's flag carrier Aeroflot could be targeted with sanctions. The EU has not said which airlines will be included, but Turkey also responded angrily to a report that its flag carrier Turkish Airlines might be affected. ""We reject efforts to portray Turkey, which is not a party to this issue, as part of the problem,"" the Turkish foreign ministry said in a statement. Trapped between two borders, the migrants have endured freezing weather in makeshift camps. Poland has reported at least seven migrant deaths in the months-long crisis and other migrants have expressed fear they would die. None of around 150 migrants gathered near the town of Bialowieza managed to breach the border, with 468 attempted crossings on Wednesday, according to the Polish border guard service. Neighbouring Lithuania, which like Poland has imposed a state of emergency on the border, also reported new crossing attempts. It said it had asked the United Nations to discuss creating a ""humanitarian corridor"" from the border zone to help the migrants return to their home countries, saying social media accounts showed some people trapped there wanted to go back. The Iraqi embassy in Moscow on Thursday said it was ready to help evacuate any Iraqi nationals who wanted to return home from Belarus, inviting them to contact it by WhatsApp or email. EU foreign ministers may approve more Belarus sanctions on Monday that could include individuals and companies, according to one diplomat. The bloc's executive commission said airlines that bring migrants would be on the list and two diplomats said the main airport in Belarus was also being considered. The EU accuses Lukashenko of manufacturing the crisis in revenge for earlier sanctions in response to a violent crackdown on mass street protests against his rule in 2020. Germany said he must be countered with all strength. ""Lukashenko is making an inhumane power play with people,"" German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, who is set to become the country's next chancellor, said. Lukashenko and Russia have said the EU was not living up to its humanitarian values by preventing migrants from crossing. Large groups fleeing conflicts and poverty in the Middle East and elsewhere started flying to Minsk this spring with the help of Belarusian travel agencies. Many have travelled to the border with Poland, Lithuania or Latvia and tried to cross into the EU, sometimes using wire cutters they say were given to them by Belarusian border guards.

The two leaders will speak by phone on Thursday. They will discuss forthcoming security talks between the countries and the situation in Europe, a White House official said. Russia, which recently built up forces on the border with Ukraine, denies planning to invade the country. It says its troops are there for exercises, and that it is entitled to move its troops freely on its own soil. Hours before the call, Mr Putin told Mr Biden in a holiday message he was ""convinced"" the pair could work together based on ""mutual respect and consideration of each other's national interests"". His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Moscow was ""in the mood for a conversation"". A day earlier, a US official told AFP news agency that Mr Biden would offer his Russian counterpart a ""diplomatic path"" but remained ""gravely"" concerned by the Russian troop build-up on the border. The head of Ukraine's national security council, Oleksiy Danilov, sought to downplay that on Thursday, suggesting the number of troops was not currently increasing: ""As for the troops build-up near our borders reported by foreign media - we do not see that. There is a certain increase of [Russian] military and we closely monitor what's happening at our borders."" Less than a month ago, Ukraine's defence minister told parliament - citing intelligence reports - that Russia had massed more than 94,000 troops near the border and could be gearing up for a large-scale military offensive at the end of January. The US has consulted European leaders ahead of the call to co-ordinate a common response to the Ukraine issue, according to a White House statement. While Ukraine is not a Nato member, it has close ties with the bloc. Russia has said it wants legally binding guarantees that Nato will not move eastwards and that weapons will not be sent to Ukraine or any neighbouring countries. Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has been adamant that Ukraine's membership of the alliance is a matter for Nato and Kyiv. ""Any dialogue with Russia has of course to respect the core principles which European security has been based on,"" he previously said. Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda has described the current situation as probably ""the most dangerous it's been in 30 years"". Russian officials are due to meet US counterparts in Geneva on 10 January. Asked earlier this week if he would meet Mr Putin on that date, Mr Biden replied ""We'll see"", but he is not expected to attend the talks in Geneva.

None of these are legit, even though they were shared widely on social media. The Associated Press checked them out. Here are the facts: ___ Paris police didn’t give fines for waving flag, saying ‘freedom’ CLAIM: Police in Paris ticketed protesters for carrying the French flag and saying the word “freedom.” THE FACTS: Paris police ticketed protesters for offenses related to “participating in a prohibited protest,” not for carrying the French flag or saying the word “freedom,” as some people falsely claimed online. Following demonstrations in the French capital last weekend against COVID-19 mandates — inspired by rallies among truckers and others in Canada — one popular post asserted that Paris police were issuing tickets with fines of up to 135 euros ($153) for actions such as holding the flag and shouting “liberté.” “Tanks and tear-gas in France, with €135 fee for those holding a french flag and €90 to those who dare utter the word “freedom”, while protesting in Paris is now made illegal,” one tweet said. While some people on social media said they took the post to be a metaphor, others believed that people were actually being ticketed for these actions. But Paris police officials said in a statement issued to The Associated Press that tickets handed out to protesters were for participating in the rally despite a police order that prohibited involvement, a police spokesperson confirmed. Police gave out two tiers of driving tickets for fines of 135 and 90 euros ($102) for infractions that related to driving on a temporarily closed road and for attending a prohibited protest, according to information from the Paris police, checked against a ledger of fine amounts from the National Agency for the Automated Processing of Offenses by the AP. Police set up checkpoints into the French capital on key roads last weekend and said they successfully stopped at least 500 vehicles from heading to the banned protest, which, like in Canada, aimed to blockade roads and use vehicles to create a convoy. Still, a few dozen vehicles were able to slip into Paris and disrupt traffic. Authorities fired tear gas as they demanded that the demonstrators disperse, some of whom climbed onto their vehicles to create chaos, the AP reported. In Canada, similar demonstrations have unfolded over the past several weeks in and around the capital city of Ottawa among truckers and others angry over Canada’s COVID-19 restrictions. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invoked emergency powers Monday to quell the protests. — Associated Press writer Sophia Tulp in Atlanta and Beatrice Dupuy in New York contributed this report. ___ Posts distort research details to suggest secret vaccine campaign CLAIM: Johns Hopkins University research shows that someone can “be vaccinated with a PCR swab test without knowing.” THE FACTS: Researchers have developed tiny devices for potentially delivering drugs, but the technology hasn’t been tested or used with vaccines — or delivered through PCR swab tests. Social media posts baselessly linked the technology developed by Johns Hopkins researchers to a method of stealthily administering vaccines to unknowing recipients. “Johns Hopkins U Confirms You Can Be Vaccinated with a PCR Swab Test Without Knowing,” reads one blog post’s headline shared on Facebook and Instagram. But the university confirmed no such thing. The blog post points to a November 2020 article by the university announcing that researchers had “designed tiny, star-shaped microdevices that can latch onto intestinal mucosa and release drugs into the body.” The researchers published a study a month prior in the journal Science Advances on using such technology to deliver medicine in animals’ gastrointestinal tract. But the so-called “theragrippers” — which latch onto tissue and release medicine — have not been approved for use in humans, or tested for vaccine administration. “This nanotechnology has shown promise in a laboratory setting,” Johns Hopkins Medicine said in a statement provided to The Associated Press. “However, it is still in its infancy and has not been approved for use in humans.” The statement said the university article “has been inaccurately used for disinformation purposes over the past few months,” noting that the devices are deployed through an endoscope and have “been neither tested nor used for vaccine delivery.” While the university’s article reporting on the research included a photo of the devices on a cotton swab, it did not say they are delivered that way. Instead, the cotton swab was used to convey the size of the devices, saying that “a theragripper is about the size of a speck of dust.” The COVID-19 vaccines that are currently authorized for use in the U.S. are administered via shots into one’s muscle. — Associated Press writer Angelo Fichera in Philadelphia contributed this report. ___ Image of girl with gun is an old meme, not recent Ukraine photo CLAIM: A photo of a girl on a bus with a rifle shows “life in Ukraine, now.” THE FACTS: The photo shows a Russian social media influencer holding a fake gun after a photo shoot in March 2020, not a recent image of life in Ukraine amid warnings of an imminent Russian invasion. The image was taken well before tensions began escalating between the two countries in recent weeks. A Twitter user shared the photo — which shows a girl scrolling through a smartphone on public transportation while holding a fake gun — last weekend, with a false caption suggesting it was just taken in Ukraine. In reality, the image was taken two years ago in Russia, according to Ekaterina Gladkikh, who lists her location on Instagram as Novosibirsk, a city in Siberia. Gladkikh told The Associated Press through direct messages on Instagram that she was returning from a photo shoot when the image was taken. “With this fake weapon, I managed to sit in a cafe and, as you can see, and take a ride in transport. None of the passers-by or the guards asked me any questions,” she said. “I live in Russia, not in Ukraine,” she added. In other photos posted on Instagram, she can be seen wearing the same beige hat from the widely shared photo. She also posted a story highlight video in March 2020 where she was wearing the same distinctive nail polish as the photo — one hand was painted with red nail polish, while the other was painted with blue polish. Reverse image search results show the photo has also appeared over time on Facebook and Twitter, with captions from 2020 and 2021 asserting it showed “a normal day in Russia.” One Facebook post from March 2020, the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, captioned the photo: “Slav Girl in need of social distance in bus.” An April 2020 entry on a blog post headlined “Evolution of a Meme: Girl in Belarus on a Bus with AK,” discussed how the image had been repurposed multiple times by online meme pages. The photo has begun recirculating in recent days as tensions mount between Russia and Ukraine. — Associated Press writers Arijeta Lajka in New York and Sophia Tulp contributed this report. ___ PA school board didn’t vote to ban CNN in classrooms CLAIM: A school board in suburban Pittsburgh voted to ban CNN from its classrooms. THE FACTS: Teachers can still use their own discretion to show instructional videos from any source, including CNN, according to Norwin School District Superintendent Jeff Taylor. The Norwin School Board had voted on Monday to stop routinely playing television programs during homeroom classes at Norwin Middle School unless they are “student, teacher or administrator driven.” But this vote by the Pittsburgh-area school board is being misrepresented online. “School District Just Banned CNN From Classrooms,” read one widely-shared headline. “CNN got thrown out of Pennsylvania classrooms for being FAKE NEWS!” a Twitter user wrote. “Pennsylvania school removes CNN from classrooms, can choose patriotic videos instead,” read a misleading Fox News headline. While the article itself contained more nuance, users on Instagram posted screenshots of the headline alone that racked up tens of thousands of likes. Taylor explained in a phone interview that teachers in the district still have the option to play CNN or any other media source they deem has instructional value. Taylor said the claims stemmed from the middle school’s use of CNN 10, a 10-minute daily digital news program for students, publicly available on CNN’s website. The program had been shown to students during the homeroom period at Norwin Middle School since 2018. In a workshop meeting  on Jan. 10, a school board member expressed concern over the program, saying it hadn’t been approved by the board and that he would like to remove it from the classroom. However, the motion that ultimately came to a board vote didn’t specifically address CNN 10. Instead, the board voted to stop showing TV programs during homeroom at Norwin Middle School to allow students to socialize and interact, unless the program was “either student, teacher or administrator driven.” A video of Monday’s meeting shows Taylor asked the board to clarify whether the phrase “teacher driven” meant teachers could still opt to show CNN 10 videos to their students. “I believe that’s the intent of the motion,” said board member Raymond Kocak. No board members expressed dissent, and the board approved the motion with a 5-4 vote. Taylor told the AP that “student, teacher or administrator driven” could be understood to mean hand-selected by those individuals. He clarified that the board’s decision covered homeroom classes for Norwin Middle School only, and did not affect curriculum for other classes or schools in the 5,300-student K-12 district. Taylor reiterated the importance of teaching current events in the classroom and pointed out that Pennsylvania state curriculum standards require it. Reached for comment, Fox News Digital Deputy Managing Editor Kelley Kramer said, “The Norwin School Board voted to end student programming from classrooms, which is accurately reflected in the FOX News Digital story.” A spokesperson for WarnerMedia, which owns CNN, declined to comment. — Associated Press writer Ali Swenson in New York contributed this report. ___ Prosecutors in DC haven’t charged Trump’s children with crimes CLAIM: Prosecutors in the District of Columbia recently filed criminal charges against Ivanka Trump and her brothers. THE FACTS: District prosecutors have not filed any criminal charges against Ivanka Trump, Eric Trump or Donald Trump Jr., according to a spokesperson for the Office of the Attorney General for the District of Columbia. The YouTube commentator who made the claim, Christo Aivalis, has also admitted it is false. Aivalis made the claim in a video titled, “Ivanka Trump CHARGED with MAJOR CRIME.” In the clip, Aivalis cites a news article discussing new developments in an ongoing lawsuit filed in January 2020 by District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine against former President Donald Trump’s inaugural committee, the Trump International Hotel and the Trump Organization, alleging that the committee overpaid the hotel to enrich the Trump family. But the suit involving the inaugural committee is a civil matter, not a criminal case. None of Trump’s children are named as defendants, although the suit alleges that Ivanka Trump was involved. Reached by the Associated Press for comment, Aivalis admitted that the claim in his video is inaccurate. “I appear to have been mistaken in this regard, misunderstanding the nature of the efforts by DC officials,” Aivalis wrote in an email to the AP. The District of Columbia attorney general’s office has not filed any criminal charges against Ivanka Trump, Eric Trump or Donald Trump Jr., spokesperson Marrisa Geller confirmed to the AP. Alan Garten, executive vice president and chief legal officer at the Trump Organization, wrote in an email to the AP that the claim that the three siblings have been criminally charged is “completely untrue.” The lawsuit filed by prosecutors in the District of Columbia alleges that the committee spent over $1 million to book a ballroom at the Trump International Hotel in the capital, and that one of the event’s planners raised concerns about the high price with Ivanka. Ivanka  has said she instructed the hotel to charge a “fair market rate.” Racine’s office announced on Thursday that the case is going to trial, according to a news release. — Associated Press writer Josh Kelety in Phoenix contributed this report. ___ Find AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck ___ Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck",western,1,2052,97.25,35.32,24,17.94,23.32,27.19,75.05,52.53,42.5,5.02,1.71,0.24,0,0.15,0.58,0.54,3.31,14.86,10.23,2.19,15.35,4.48,2.05,4.04,1.17,9.99,3.8,2.29,4.14,0.34,0.34,3.27,8.28,0.24,8.04,1.22,1.22,0.58,1.27,0.24,3.7,0,2.05,0.93,1.12,0.29,0.15,0.15,0,0.05,0,0,11.11,6.82,0.29,0.05,0.49,0.49,4.24,4.14,0.1,0,0.68,0.19,2.92,1.02,0.39,1.51,6.87,0.39,0,5.85,0.54,0.15,1.22,0.93,0.63,0,0,0,0,0.05,0,0.24,0,0.58,0.15,0,0,0.05,0.1,0.34,2.29,8.19,0.34,0.88,6.04,0.97,0.05,0.1,3.31,5.85,2.19,0.24,0.44,0.44,0,0,0,16.57,4.48,4.48,0,0.05,1.12,6.43

While that serves his purpose, it is also a fiction. Ukraine has its own thousand-year history. What is now Ukraine was a contested region of shifting borders for centuries that did not come completely under Moscow’s rule until late in the 18th century during the reign of Catherine the Great, and even then the Russian Empire was never able to swallow it easily or completely. In his present-day effort to bring an independent, Western-looking Ukraine back into Russia’s orbit, Putin is following a well-trod path of many of Russia’s rulers before him — from Peter the Great to Josef Stalin. For the West, the question is whether it can limit Putin’s revanchist ambitions through diplomacy, sanctions and Ukrainian military resistance. The recognition of the two breakaway regions by Putin, and the sending in of Russian troops already threatening the country, could easily be the trigger for a wider war for all of Ukraine. “I consider it necessary to take a long-overdue decision: To immediately recognize the independence and sovereignty of Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic,” Putin said, referring to two pro-Russian parts of Ukraine in the Donbas region that since 2014 have been engaged in a war with the Kyiv government that has claimed an estimated 14,000 lives already. Every modern state, especially in Europe, has had centuries of changing borders, and the emotional tug of nationalism can lead to demands, ultimatums and often war for territory, power and influence. In his speech to the Russian public on Monday night, a sometimes sullen, sometimes angry-sounding Putin was dismissive of modern-day Ukraine, arguing that its creation as a sovereign state was a tragedy and an accident of communist leaders in the 20th century. Acting as though there had never been a historical Ukraine until Soviet times, Putin blamed at times Vladimir Lenin, at times Stalin and at one point he saved scorn for the decision of Nikita Khrushchev to take Crimea from Russia in 1954 and award it to Ukraine. As with all historical narratives, there were elements of truth in what Putin was saying. Ukrainians and Russians are related eastern Slavic peoples whose destinies have been both intertwined and separated throughout history. But he preferred to focus on the time of Russia’s maximum dominance over Ukraine — neatly forgetting that it has been a separate state recognized by international treaties and explicitly by Russia over the last 30 years. Instead, he painted today’s Ukraine as a corrupt, barely functioning puppet of the United States that threatens Russia’s security and, in his view, has no real reason to exist except in union with Russia. Both Ukraine and Russia trace themselves to Kievan Rus, a trading center set up by Vikings along the Dnieper River more than 1,000 years ago, before Moscow even existed, that was originally pagan and later embraced Orthodox Christianity. Kievan Rus fell afterward to the early 13th century Mongol invasions of Europe. Muscovy did not emerge from being a vassal state until the late 15th century. Instead of being connected to Russian Moscow, all of what is now Ukraine instead for centuries was part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from the 1300s, and later of the Union of Poland and Lithuania, a vast multilingual, multiethnic state whose territory encompassed almost all of what is now Poland, Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine (and parts of what is now Russia.) In its eastern and southeastern regions, the union’s dominant languages were Polish and Ruthenian, the predecessor to modern-day Ukrainian and Belarusian. The population included Ukrainians, Poles, Belarusians, Lithuanians, Jews and Tartars. Uprisings by an army of Ukrainian Cossacks against Polish lords and landowners in the middle 1600s led to a Cossack alliance with Moscow and eastern Ukraine breaking off from the Polish-Lithuanian Union and pledging loyalty to the czar in 1654. Western Ukraine remained part of the Polish-Lithuanian Union for another 150 years, until Poland was partitioned for the final time in 1795 and erased from the map of Europe. Poland rose again after World War I and fought a territorial war with Soviet Russia between 1919 and 1922, winning back much of Ukraine. Those lands returned to Soviet control a generation later during and after World War II, but after the war Ukrainian nationalist partisans fought on against the Soviets in a guerrilla resistance for several years. The “great famine” or Holodomor imposed on Ukraine by Stalin in the early 1930s had led to millions of deaths and seeded lingering Ukrainian bitterness toward Soviet Russian rule. That the Bolsheviks recognized Ukraine as a separate socialist republic when the Soviet Union was created was no accident. It addressed the reality of Ukraine’s separate history and identity, poised somewhere between Moscow and the West for most of its existence, but never given the chance to rule itself until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Contrary to Putin, most Ukrainians do not clamor to be part of Russia today, and anti-Russian sentiment in most of the country has only increased since Russia’s 2014 seizure of Crimea and the taking of the Donbas region by pro-Moscow separatists. Now with Russian troops marching into the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine again, it looks as though the millennial-long tug of war for dominance in the area, with the use of force of arms or diplomacy as needed, is about to renew again. ___ EDITOR’S NOTE — John Daniszewski, an AP vice president and former correspondent in Eastern Europe, has written about European affairs since the 1980s.",western,1,934,94.19,27.76,75.65,13.37,30.13,28.8,80.62,58.03,48.72,4.71,1.5,0.21,0,0,0.96,0.11,3.21,13.28,8.67,2.78,18.31,5.14,4.39,7.71,0.86,8.46,4.39,4.82,6.64,1.28,0.86,4.6,9.85,1.18,8.57,1.18,1.71,0.54,1.28,0.43,3.75,0.11,3,1.07,1.71,0.64,0,0.43,0,0.21,0.11,0,4.93,2.14,0.21,0,0.54,0.21,0.75,2.57,0,0,0,1.07,5.46,2.89,2.57,0,1.18,0,0,0.75,0.11,0.43,0.54,0.11,0.11,0,0,0,0,0.11,0.11,0.21,0,0.32,0.11,0,0,0.21,0.43,0.21,2.68,10.06,0.11,0.86,9.21,0.21,0,0,8.24,5.14,3.1,0.21,0,0,0,0,0,13.6,3.32,6,0,0,1.5,2.78
580,apnews.com,2022-01-21 08:00:00,https://apnews.com/f7a3da26cb574ce4beaf5616573f16c0,"Top US , Russian diplomats meet with Ukraine future on brink",English,United States,"GENEVA (AP) — Top U.S. and Russian diplomats agreed Friday to keep talking in the standoff over Ukraine, even though their meeting produced no movement in the crisis that has seen Moscow mass tens of thousands of troops at the border and the West ramp up supplies of weapons to Kyiv. With fears of an invasion of Ukraine running high and seemingly intractable demands, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met for about 90 minutes in Geneva at what the American said was a “critical moment.” Expectations were low going in, and there was no breakthrough. Blinken told Lavrov the U.S. would give Russia written responses to Moscow’s proposals next week and suggested the two would likely meet again shortly after that — offering some hope that any invasion would be delayed for at least a few more days. Blinken said the U.S. and its allies remain resolute in rejecting Russia’s most important demands, which were reiterated Friday. Moscow wants NATO to promise that Ukraine will never be added as a member, that no alliance weapons will be deployed near Russian borders, and that it pull back its forces from Central and Eastern Europe. Despite that, there was no indication the U.S. responses would be any different from the flat-out rejections already expressed by Washington and its allies, clouding future diplomatic efforts. “We didn’t expect any major breakthroughs to happen today, but I believe we are now on a clearer path to understanding each other’s positions,” Blinken said after the meeting. Blinken said he also wanted to use the opportunity to share directly with Lavrov some “concrete ideas to address some of the concerns that you have raised, as well as the deep concerns that many of us have about Russia’s actions.” Blinken said Lavrov repeated Russia’s insistence that it has no plans to invade Ukraine, but the U.S. and its allies were not convinced. “We’re looking at what is visible to all, and it is deeds and actions and not words that make all the difference,” he said, adding that Russia should remove its troops from the Ukrainian border if it wanted to prove its point. Lavrov, meanwhile, called the talks “constructive and useful” but declined to characterize the U.S. pledge. “I can’t say whether we are on the right track or not,” he told reporters. “We will understand that when we receive the U.S. written response to all of our proposals.” Blinken suggested there was no leeway on Russia’s demands, saying firmly: “There is no trade space there: None.” The U.S. and its allies say Russian President Vladimir Putin knows the demands are nonstarters, adding that they’re open to less-dramatic moves. Blinken said the U.S. would be open to a meeting between Putin and U.S. President Joe Biden, if it would be “useful and productive.” The two have met once in person in Geneva and have had several virtual conversations on Ukraine that have proven largely inconclusive. An estimated 100,000 Russian troops have been sent to areas near Ukraine, and more were moving into the neighborhood for training exercises with neighboring Belarus. Late Friday, the U.S. embassy in Kyiv tweeted photos of a shipment it said had just arrived from the U.S., with “close to 200,000 pounds of lethal aid, including ammunition for the front line defenders of Ukraine.” Western allies were also supplying weaponry and equipment to Ukraine. Britain sent anti-tank missiles earlier this week, while the defense ministers of the Baltic nations issued a statement saying they received U.S. approval to send Stinger air defense missiles and Javelin anti-tank missiles to strengthen Kyiv’s defenses. “Today Ukraine is at the forefront of separating Europe from the military conflict with Russia,” said Estonian Defense Minister Kalle Laanet. “Let´s face it — the war in Ukraine is ongoing and it is important to support Ukraine in every way we can so that they can resist the aggressor.” The Pentagon said the USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier and its strike group will participate in a NATO maritime exercise in the Mediterranean, which will continue through Feb. 4 — something that has been planned since 2020, said Pentagon press secretary John Kirby. He said officials considered whether to go ahead with the exercise, because of the ongoing tensions, and decided to move ahead. Kirby said the exercise wasn’t planned anticipating a Russian move on Ukraine and is “not designed against any of the kinds of scenarios that might happen with respect to Ukraine.” On Thursday, Russia had announced sweeping naval maneuvers through February, some apparently in the Black Sea. The U.S. and its allies scrambled to present a united front. Washington and its allies have repeatedly promised consequences  such as biting economic sanctions against Russia — though not military action — if it invades. Blinken repeated that Friday, saying the U.S. and its allies were committed to diplomacy but also committed “if that proves impossible, and Russia decides to pursue aggression against Ukraine, to a united, swift and severe response.” After the meeting, Blinken spoke by phone with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba to brief him on his talks this week and reaffirm U.S. support for Kyiv’s sovereignty and stress that no decisions would be made without his country’s input, State Department spokesman Ned Price said. He also will brief the foreign ministers of Washington’s European allies. Biden plans to spend the weekend huddling with his national security team at Camp David, press secretary Jen Psaki said. In other diplomatic moves, President Sauli Niinistö of Finland said he spoke with Putin by phone on European security and Ukraine, saying it was “imperative to preserve peace in Europe,” according to his office. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of NATO member Turkey, which touted its strong ties with Russia and Ukraine, renewed an offer to mediate between the two countries. Erdogan said he plans to visit Kyiv next month, adding that he would also hold talks with Putin. Ukraine is already beset by conflict. Russia seized control of Ukraine’s Crimea Peninsula in 2014 and backed a separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine, part of a simmering but largely stalemated conflict that has killed 14,000. Putin faced limited international consequences for those moves, but the West says a new invasion would be different. Blinken met Ukraine’s president in Kyiv and top diplomats from Britain, France and Germany in Berlin this week. Blinken’s effort to stress U.S. unity with its allies took an apparent hit Wednesday when Biden drew widespread criticism for saying retaliation for Russian aggression in Ukraine would depend on the details and that a “minor incursion” could prompt discord among Western allies. On Thursday, Biden sought to clarify his comments by cautioning that any Russian troop movements across Ukraine’s border would constitute an invasion and that Moscow would “pay a heavy price” for such an action. “I’ve been absolutely clear with President Putin,” Biden said. “He has no misunderstanding: Any, any assembled Russian units move across the Ukrainian border, that is an invasion.” Adding to its warnings, Washington stepped up sanctions Thursday by slapping new measures on four Ukrainian officials who Blinken said were at the center of a Kremlin effort begun in 2020 to damage Kyiv’s ability to “independently function.” The United States and allies say countries like Ukraine are entitled to their own alliances as part of sovereign security measures, but Lavrov countered that Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe have also agreed that no nation can ensure its security by undermining security of others. In eastern Ukraine, a soldier stationed near the front line with Russia-backed separatists called Blinken’s visit to Kyiv “very important for our country.” The soldier, who identified himself only by his first name, Serhiy, in line with official rules, voiced hope that if Russia attacked, “we can count on our forces’ and our allies’ power.” ___ Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow, Jan M.

Independent journalists, human rights advocates and activists in at least nine large Belarusian cities had phones and computers seized during the searches and were interrogated, the Viasna human rights center reported. In the capital, Minsk, authorities targeted 10 people accused of funding antigovernment protests and spreading information deemed extremist. Some 300 chats on the popular messaging app Telegram have been designated extremist by authorities, and users of those chats can be sentenced to up to 7 years in prison, if charged and convicted. Freelance journalist Larysa Shchyrakova said she was brought in for questioning after an hours-long search of her home in Gomel, a city 300 kilometers (186 miles) southeast of Minsk. Shchyrakova used to work with the Belsat TV channel, which authorities in Belarus have declared extremist. “I was being pressured to confess to funding the protests, but I refused to incriminate myself,” Shchyrakova told The Associated Press by telephone. “They took my phone, audio and video equipment, which was still in my home after the two previous raids.” Activists and journalists in Brest, Vitebsk, Mogilev, Grodno, Mazyr and other cities experienced similar raids and detentions on Wednesday. Leaders of regional branches of the United Civil Party, the oldest opposition party in Belarus, in Gomel and Rechytsa were targeted as well. “The new wave of repressions shows that the authorities in Belarus don’t feel confident and are forced to tighten the screws because discontent in the country is growing,” party leader Anatoly Lebedko told the AP by phone from Vilnius. “The situation with civic freedoms and human rights in Belarus is deteriorating rapidly, edging closer to the standards of North Korea,” Lebedko said. The authoritarian leader of Belarus, President Alexander Lukashenko, survived months of unprecedented mass protests prompted by his Aug. 2020 reelection in a vote the opposition and Western countries denounced as a sham. Lukashenko unleashed a violent crackdown on the demonstrators, with police arresting more than 35,000 and beating thousands. Since last year’s election, Lukashenko’s government has shut down the majority of independent media outlets and rights groups. According to human rights advocates, 889 political prisoners, including top opposition activists, remain behind bars in Belarus. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Belarus at https://apnews.com/hub/belarus",western,1,408,97.36,33.14,53.68,8.71,22.67,33.58,76.72,51.47,39.95,3.43,2.21,1.23,0,0,0.74,0.25,1.23,11.03,7.35,3.19,16.91,4.41,0.74,6.37,0.25,7.84,5.15,4.66,8.82,1.23,0.49,7.11,5.15,0,4.9,0.98,1.23,0.25,0.49,0,2.21,0,4.17,1.47,2.7,0.74,0.25,0.49,0,0.25,0,0,12.25,8.58,0,0,1.96,2.7,4.17,2.45,0,0,0.49,0.25,8.09,5.88,0.25,1.96,4.9,0.98,0.74,2.45,0.49,0.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.72,12.25,0.49,0.98,10.05,0.25,0.25,0.25,4.17,4.41,1.72,0,0.25,0.25,0,0,0,18.14,4.41,7.84,0,0,0.98,4.9

REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/Jefferson Siegel NEW YORK, Oct 15 (Reuters) - (This October 15 story was refiled to fix typographical error in second paragraph.) A former candidate for Nevada's governorship testified on Friday that former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani introduced him to Lev Parnas, a onetime Giuliani associate now on trial for alleged campaign finance law violations, who facilitated a contribution to the candidate. Adam Laxalt, who lost his bid for the governorship, said he ultimately received a $10,000 donation from Parnas associate Igor Fruman shortly before the Nov. 6, 2018 election. But he said his campaign did not accept the funds because of doubts about the true source and concerns the contribution was illegal. Prosecutors called Laxalt to testify in Parnas' Manhattan federal court trial. The Ukraine native has been charged with illegally funneling money from a Russian businessman to the campaigns of candidates for office in states where Parnas, Fruman and associates were seeking licenses to run cannabis businesses.  read more Laxalt said he met Giuliani, who was then personal attorney for former President Donald Trump, at the Trump International Hotel in Washington two months before the 2018 state election. Laxalt, a Republican, said he then accompanied Giuliani to a balcony at the hotel, where a group including Parnas were smoking cigars and drinking. Parnas ""immediately offered to help my campaign,"" Laxalt told the jury in the case overseen by U.S. District Judge J. Paul Oetken. There was no suggestion that Giuliani did anything illegal by introducing Laxalt to Parnas. Prosecutors are separately probing whether Giuliani violated lobbying laws while working as Trump's lawyer. Giuliani has not been charged with any crime and has denied wrongdoing. The case has drawn attention because of Parnas' and former co-defendant Fruman's roles helping Giuliani investigate President Joe Biden's activities in Ukraine. Biden, a Democrat, defeated Trump in the Republican's 2020 bid for re-election. Giuliani's lawyer has said Parnas' case and the lobbying probe are unrelated. Parnas pleaded not guilty. Belarus-born Fruman pleaded guilty in September. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

806,apnews.com,2022-02-03 08:00:00,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-europe-belarus-jens-stoltenberg-43c9151532de706a2edec5684dfcf07d,NATO chief wary of Russian troop buildup in Belarus,English,United States,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. accused the Kremlin on Thursday of an elaborate plot to fabricate an attack by Ukrainian forces that Russia could use as a pretext to take military action against its neighbor. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the scheme included production of a graphic propaganda video that would show staged explosions and use corpses and actors depicting grieving mourners. The U.S. has not provided detailed information backing up the claims. The plan for a fake attack on Russian territory or Russian-speaking people was described in declassified intelligence shared with Ukrainian officials and European allies in recent days. It was the latest example of the Biden administration divulging intelligence findings  as a tactic to attempt to stop Russian disinformation efforts and foil what it says is Russian President Vladimir Putin’s effort to lay the groundwork for military action. If Russia does invade, administration officials say they want to make clear Russia had always sought to create a pretext. In recent weeks, the White House has said that U.S. intelligence shows Russia has launched a malign social media disinformation campaign against Ukraine and has dispatched operatives trained in explosives to carry out acts of sabotage against Russia’s own proxy forces. Britain has divulged intelligence findings that it says show Russia plotting to install a pro-Russian puppet government in Ukraine. “We’ve seen these kinds of activity by the Russians in the past, and we believe it’s important when we see it like this and and we can, to call it out,” Kirby told reporters at the Pentagon. The administration has repeatedly declined to detail evidence underlying its intelligence findings. State Department spokesman Ned Price said Thursday the administration needed to protect sensitive sources and intelligence gathering methods. He added “we declassify information only when we’re confident in that information.” Meanwhile on Thursday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan offered to mediate talks between Russia and Ukraine, and NATO warned that Moscow’s military buildup continues, with more troops and military equipment deployed to neighboring Belarus than at any time in the last 30 years. Erdogan, who has close but sometimes difficult ties with Putin, said Turkey was “prepared to undertake its part in order to end the crisis between two friendly nations that are its neighbors in the Black Sea.” “I have stressed that we would be happy to host a summit meeting at a leadership level or technical level talks,” Erdogan said after about three hours of talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. “Instead of fueling the fire, we act with the logical aim of reducing the tensions.” Russia has amassed more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine’s northern and eastern borders, raising concern that Moscow might invade again, as it did in 2014. The troop presence and uncertainty have unnerved Ukrainians and hurt the country’s economy. Russian officials deny that an invasion is planned. Zelenskyy welcomed Erdogan’s offer and thanked him for his “firm and consistent” support. The crisis has put Turkey in a fix, leaving it in a position where it has to balance its growing partnership with Ukraine with its difficult relations with Moscow. Ankara, which has historic ties to Ukraine and ethnic bonds with its Crimean Tatar community, strongly opposed Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea. At the same time, Turkey would be reluctant to joint in any sanctions against Russia. With a struggling economy, the country has pinned its hopes on tourism revenue, especially from visitors from Russia. It also relies on Russia for much of its natural gas. The U.S. said the new intelligence indicates that the Russians would stage military equipment used by Ukraine, including a key weapon supplied by Turkey, a NATO member, to bolster the credibility of a fake attack. Russia would possibly use Turkish-made Bayraktar drones as part of the fake operation, according to a senior administration official who was not authorized to comment and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The drones have been used by Ukraine against pro-Russia separatists in the Donbas region, a move that angered Moscow, which has made clear it is strongly opposed to Ukraine being equipped with the technology. Putin and French President Emmanuel Macron spoke again Thursday, their third call in less than a week. The Kremlin said in a statement that they continued a “detailed dialogue about the situation around Ukraine” and added that Putin drew Macron’s attention to “provocative statements and actions” by the Ukrainian leadership. At NATO headquarters, Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned that Russian troop numbers in Belarus are likely to climb to 30,000, with the backing of special forces, advanced fighter jets, Iskander short-range ballistic missiles and S-400 ground-to-air missile defense systems. “Over the last days, we have seen a significant movement of Russian military forces into Belarus. This is the biggest Russian deployment there since the Cold War,” Stoltenberg told reporters. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu was in Minsk on Thursday, checking on preparations for major Russia-Belarus war games scheduled for Feb. 10 to Feb. 20. Shoigu met with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. Speaking about the drills, Lukashenko said the goal was “to reinforce the border with Ukraine.” At the same time, Ukraine’s defense minister sought again to project calm, saying the probability of an invasion was “low,” and he welcomed a change by U.S. officials, who have stopped using the term “imminent” when describing the risk of a Russian attack. Oleksii Reznikov said “the threat exists, the risks exist, but they have existed since 2014, ever since Russia has become an aggressor.” He said “there are no grounds for panic, fear, flight or the packing of bags.” The minister put the number of Russian troops near Ukraine at 115,000. Still, Stoltenberg renewed his call for Russia to “de-escalate,” and repeated warnings from the West that “any further Russian aggression would have severe consequences and carry a heavy price.” NATO has no intention of deploying troops to Ukraine should Russia invade, but it has begun to reinforce the defenses of nearby member countries — notably Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. The 30-nation military alliance also plans to beef up its defenses in the Black Sea region near Bulgaria and Romania. In Helsinki, Finnish leaders held talks with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen about a letter that Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov sent to several countries on the “indivisibility of security” in Europe. Lavrov argues that the U.S. and NATO misunderstand the concept — which essentially means that the security of one European country is linked to the security of them all — and he has demanded replies from countries that signed a key security document encompassing it to clarify the issue. Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said there was no “big news” in the letter but that it warranted a reply. Von der Leyen said the commission, the EU’s executive branch, will coordinate a response, even though Lavrov insisted that only countries and not organizations should answer. ___ Fraser reported from Ankara and Madhani from Washington.

Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, who led the Russian delegation at the security talks with the U.S. in Geneva last week, reaffirmed that Moscow has no intentions of invading Ukraine as the West fears, but said that receiving Western security guarantees is an imperative for Moscow. The talks in Geneva and a related NATO-Russia meeting in Brussels last week were held as Russia has amassed an estimated 100,000 troops near Ukraine in what the West fears might herald an invasion. Amid the soaring tensions, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Ukraine on Wednesday to reassure it of Western support in the face of what he called “relentless” Russian aggression. In Strasbourg, French President Emmanuel Macron urged the European Union to quickly draw up a new security plan containing proposals to help ease tensions with Russia. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Wednesday that talks between Blinken and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov set for Friday in Geneva are “extremely important.” In a move that further beefs up forces near Ukraine, Russia has sent an unspecified number of troops from the country’s far east to its ally Belarus, which shares a border with Ukraine, for major war games next month. Ukrainian officials have said that Moscow could use Belarusian territory to launch a potential multi-pronged invasion. The Russian Defense Ministry said Wednesday that some troops already have arrived in Belarus for the Allied Resolve 2022 drills that will run through Feb. 20. It said the exercise will be held at five firing ranges and other areas in Belarus and involve four Belarusian air bases. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Wednesday it’s too early to tell whether talks could defuse the crisis, adding that “after years of rising tensions, staying silent is not a sensible option.” “The Russian side is aware of our determination,” Scholz told the World Economic Forum. “I hope they also realize that the gains of cooperation outweigh the price of further confrontation.” Russia has denied that it intends to attack its neighbor but demanded guarantees from the West that NATO will not expand to Ukraine or other former Soviet nations or place its troops and weapons there. It also has urged NATO to roll back the deployments of its troops and weapons to Central and Eastern European nations that have joined the alliance after the end of the Cold War. Washington and its allies firmly rejected Moscow’s demands but kept the door open to possible further talks on arms control and confidence-building measures to reduce the potential for hostilities. Ryabkov insisted, however, that there can’t be any meaningful talks on those issues if the West doesn’t heed the main Russian requests for the non-expansion of NATO. He warned that the Russian demands “constitute a package, and we’re not prepared to divide it into different parts, to start processing some of those at expense of standing idle on others.” The Russian diplomat said Ukraine’s increasingly close ties with NATO allies pose a major security challenge to Russia. “We see the threat of Ukraine becoming ever more integrated in NATO without even acquiring a formal status of a NATO member state,” Ryabkov said, pointing at Western powers supplying Ukraine with weapons, training its troops and conducting joint drills. “This is something that goes right to the center of Russia’s national security interests, and we will do our utmost to reverse this situation.” Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 after mass protests prompted Ukraine’s Moscow-friendly leader to flee to Russia. At the same time, Russia also cast its support behind a separatist insurgency that swept over large areas in eastern Ukraine. More than 14,000 people have been killed in nearly eight years of fighting there. Asked if Russia could accept a moratorium on NATO’s expansion eastward, an idea circulated by some political experts, Ryabkov answered with a firm no, saying that Moscow has seen the West backtrack on previous promises. He emphasized that “for us, the matter of priority is achievement of watertight, bulletproof, legally binding guarantees” that Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations will not join the alliance. Ryabkov suggested that the U.S. could also take a unilateral obligation to never vote for NATO membership for Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations. Russia has urged the U.S. and NATO to provide a quick written response. Peskov told reporters Russia expects to receive it “within days.” ___ Matthew Lee in Kyiv, Ukraine and Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed to this report.",western,1,778,91.8,40.83,47.23,15.88,25.1,29.69,81.23,56.43,42.54,7.58,1.67,0.13,0.77,0,0.51,0.13,5.91,14.78,7.97,1.03,14.4,4.76,2.31,4.63,1.29,11.18,7.07,2.96,7.97,3.21,0.77,4.11,10.28,0.64,9.51,1.03,1.41,0.77,1.8,0.9,3.86,0,4.76,2.19,2.57,0.77,0.13,0.64,0.26,0.39,0,0,11.7,7.84,1.41,0.13,1.29,0,4.24,4.63,0,0.13,0,0.64,6.17,4.24,1.93,0,2.31,0.13,0.13,1.67,0.39,0,0.39,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.13,0.26,0.13,1.03,0.13,0,0,0.13,1.29,0.13,2.31,11.83,0.64,1.16,9.13,0.26,0.13,0.64,3.73,4.37,3.47,2.06,0,0,0,0,0,14.91,5.27,3.86,0,0,1.41,4.37
810,apnews.com,2022-02-09 08:00:00,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-nord-stream-2-oil-pipeline-779970ee17f6fa9d0fa2996e45cbeab9,"EXPLAINER : What Russia Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Europe ? ",English,United States,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — U.S. President Joe Biden has threatened to block the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine. The undersea pipeline directly links Russian gas to Europe via Germany and is complete but not yet operating. It has become a major target as Western governments try to deter a Russian attack on its neighbor. In the past, it has been a source of tension between the U.S., which opposed the project, and Germany. Chancellor Olaf Scholz said all options were on the table but avoided mentioning Nord Stream 2 specifically at a news conference with Biden in Washington. If Russian tanks roll into Ukraine, “there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2,” Biden said Monday. Scholz stressed the need to keep some ambiguity about sanctions to press Russia to deescalate. Here are key things to understand about the pipeline: WHAT IS NORD STREAM 2? A 1,230-kilometer-long (764-mile-long) natural gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea, running from Russia to Germany’s Baltic coast. It would double the capacity of an earlier Nord Stream pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters of gas a year and sidesteps Ukraine and Poland, which would lose transit fees. They also said the project would increase Russia’s leverage over Europe. The pipeline has been filled with gas but is not operating yet pending approval by Germany’s utility regulators and the European Commission. WHY DOES RUSSIA WANT THE PIPELINE? State-owned producer Gazprom says it will meet Europe’s growing need for affordable natural gas and complement existing pipelines through Belarus and Ukraine. Europe imports most of its gas and gets around 40% from Russia. Nord Stream 2 would offer an alternative to Ukraine’s aging system, lower costs by saving transit fees paid to Ukraine and Poland, and avoid episodes like brief 2006 and 2009 gas cutoffs over price and payment disputes between Russia and Ukraine. WHY IS BIDEN AGAINST IT? The U.S., European NATO allies such as Poland, and Ukraine have opposed the project going back before the Biden administration. They said it gives Russia the possibility of using gas as a geopolitical weapon. Biden waived sanctions against the pipeline’s operator when it was almost complete in return for an agreement from Germany to take action against Russia if it used gas as a weapon or attacks Ukraine. But the U.S. still thinks Nord Stream 2 is a bad idea. Meanwhile, Scholz, who took the helm in Germany in December, backed the project as Angela Merkel’s finance minister, and his Social Democratic Party supported it. While he has avoided referring to Nord Stream 2 specifically, Scholz says Russia would face “severe consequences” and that sanctions must be ready ahead of time. HOW WOULD BIDEN BLOCK NORD STREAM 2? The U.S. could impose heavy financial sanctions — penalizing anyone or any company that does business involving the pipeline, effectively scaring away banks and businesses and making it impossible for the pipeline to operate. Biden hasn’t said if that’s the route he might pursue. Asked Monday how the U.S. would stop something that’s under German control, Biden only said, “I promise you, we’ll be able to do it.” Scholz added, “You can be sure that there won’t be any measures in which we have a differing approach. We will act together jointly.” In Congress, Republicans and Democrats — in a rare bit of agreement — have long objected to Nord Stream for the leverage it gives Russia over Europe. They have been split for months on whether to impose sanctions on Nord Stream 2 now or only if Russia invades. Bill backers have refused to say what compromise they might be working on. In Germany, the approval process has been presented as strictly a legal decision, not a political one, raising questions about what mechanism could be used if there’s a Russian attack. In Europe, sanctions against Russia over its seizure of Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula in 2014 were agreed at the European Union level. WILL NORD STREAM 2 HELP EUROPE’S NATURAL GAS CRISIS? Not immediately or directly. Since regulators won’t approve it for months, the pipeline cannot help meet heating and electricity needs this winter as the continent faces a gas shortage. Gazprom could, if it chose, send more gas through existing pipelines. The winter crunch has continued to feed concerns about Russia and gas. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said the shortage underlines the need for quick Nord Stream 2 approval. Russia held back from short-term gas sales — even though it fulfilled long-term contracts with European customers — and failed to fill its underground storage in Europe. Some analysts say Russia had to fill its own winter reserves first, and Gazprom has stressed its role as a reliable long-term supplier. Whatever the motivation, Putin’s comments did little to relieve concerns that Russia is inclined to use gas for political leverage. IS RUSSIA THE BOSS ON GAS? That’s oversimplifying. While Europe needs Russian gas, Gazprom also relies on the European market for sales to support Russian government budgets. And the European Union has been able to force Gazprom to comply with many of its anti-monopoly rules in recent years. That interdependence is why many think Russia won’t cut off gas to Europe even if the conflict over Ukraine escalates, and Russian officials have underlined they have no intention to do that. ___ Associated Press writers Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow, Geir Moulson in Berlin, and Lisa Mascaro and Ellen Knickmeyer in Washington contributed.",western,1,901,78.11,29.02,15.08,14.19,18.39,27.41,75.03,56.05,43.84,6.33,1.66,0.11,0.33,0.22,0.33,0.55,4.66,10.32,6.66,2.44,12.99,8.32,3.44,6.66,1.22,14.87,5.33,2.66,6.44,1,1,4.44,11.43,0.33,11.1,1.11,2.11,2.55,2.77,0.33,4,0,3.22,1.33,1.89,0.44,0,0.44,0.33,0,0,0,7.21,4.22,0.78,0,1.22,0,1.55,2.77,0,0,0,0.33,4.77,3.11,1.44,0.22,4,0.11,0.11,2.33,1.89,0,0.55,0.22,0.11,0.11,0,0,0,0.11,0,0.89,0.11,0.33,0.22,0.67,0,0,0.78,0,3.66,6.88,0,0.78,5.77,0.11,0,0.33,3.55,3.55,4.11,1.33,0,0,0,0,0,15.87,6.1,4.11,0.67,0,2.11,2.89

",English,United States,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — U.S. President Joe Biden has threatened to block the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine. The undersea pipeline directly links Russian gas to Europe via Germany and is complete but not yet operating. It has become a major target as Western governments try to deter a Russian attack on its neighbor. In the past, it has been a source of tension between the U.S., which opposed the project, and Germany. Chancellor Olaf Scholz said all options were on the table but avoided mentioning Nord Stream 2 specifically at a news conference with Biden in Washington. If Russian tanks roll into Ukraine, “there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2,” Biden said Monday. Scholz stressed the need to keep some ambiguity about sanctions to press Russia to deescalate. Here are key things to understand about the pipeline: WHAT IS NORD STREAM 2? A 1,230-kilometer-long (764-mile-long) natural gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea, running from Russia to Germany’s Baltic coast. It would double the capacity of an earlier Nord Stream pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters of gas a year and sidesteps Ukraine and Poland, which would lose transit fees. They also said the project would increase Russia’s leverage over Europe. The pipeline has been filled with gas but is not operating yet pending approval by Germany’s utility regulators and the European Commission. WHY DOES RUSSIA WANT THE PIPELINE? State-owned producer Gazprom says it will meet Europe’s growing need for affordable natural gas and complement existing pipelines through Belarus and Ukraine. Europe imports most of its gas and gets around 40% from Russia. Nord Stream 2 would offer an alternative to Ukraine’s aging system, lower costs by saving transit fees paid to Ukraine and Poland, and avoid episodes like brief 2006 and 2009 gas cutoffs over price and payment disputes between Russia and Ukraine.

Maxim Guchek/BelTA/Handout via REUTERS BRUSSELS/WARSAW, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Polish security forces fired water cannon at rock-throwing migrants on the border with Belarus on Tuesday, and NATO reiterated its support for Warsaw in a crisis that has left thousands stranded on the frontier in icy temperatures. Video footage released by Polish authorities showed migrants  also throwing bottles and logs across a barbed-wire border fence, and using sticks to try to break through. Seven police were hurt in the violence, the latest in a crisis the European Union says is orchestrated by Belarus - an ally of Russia - in retaliation for EU sanctions imposed over a crackdown on political protests, a charge that Minsk denies. Up to 4,000 migrants, mostly from Iraq and Afghanistan, are now waiting in freezing forests on what is not only Poland's frontier but is also the external border of the EU and NATO, the Western military alliance. ""We are deeply concerned about the way the (Belarusian leader Alexander) Lukashenko regime is using vulnerable migrants as a hybrid tactic against other countries,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told alliance defence ministers meeting in Brussels. ""We stand in solidarity with Poland and all the allies affected."" Lithuania and Latvia, which like Poland are members of NATO and the EU, have also reported a sharp increase in attempts to cross from Belarus since summer. At least eight migrants have died at the border during the crisis. One, a 19-year-old Syrian man, was buried on Tuesday in the northeastern Polish village of Bohoniki.  read more A nine-year old Kurdish boy who has had both legs amputated was among those stuck between the lakes, swamps and forests at the frontier after Poland refused to let them in and Belarusian forces prevented them heading back.  read more ""We can see enormous suffering of people who are left in limbo,"" said Dunja Mijatovic, human rights commissioner for the Council of Europe, a European rights watchdog that is larger than the EU and also counts Russia among its members. After visiting a migrants' aid centre in a Polish town nearby the border, she said: ""We need to find a way to de-escalate, to make sure that the focus is on stopping the suffering."" Relations between Belarus and the EU worsened after a contested presidential election last year in which Lukashenko, who has held power since 1994, claimed victory. That triggered mass street protests and, in turn, a police crackdown. The EU agreed on Monday to impose more sanctions on Belarus to target airlines, travel agencies and individuals involved in pushing migrants towards the border. The EU and NATO have asked Russia, Lukashenko's most important ally, to make him end the crisis. The West has also warned the Kremlin over what NATO says is a Russian military buildup on the border with neighbouring Ukraine. In Brussels, French Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly said Europe was keeping a close eye on both the Belarus-Polish border and Russia's activity near Ukraine. ""It is an unsupportable instrumentalisation (of migrants),"" she said. Italian Defence Minister Lorenzo Guerini said the West was acting together to ""firmly condemn the Belarusian regime."" Russian President Vladimir Putin and Lukashenko discussed the matter on Tuesday, Russian state news agency TASS quoted the Kremlin as saying. Belarusian state news agency BELTA said border guards had started moving migrants who gathered at a closed crossing point to a reception centre further away from the frontier. Moscow has dismissed a U.S. State Department comment that the crisis was meant to distract attention from Ukraine, from which Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. Russia has also backed separatists fighting government troops in eastern Ukraine. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

658,apnews.com,2022-01-27 08:00:00,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-europe-russia-united-states-moscow-1b213930aeced003b990adb474ef722b,"US response on Ukraine offers little optimism , Russia says",English,United States,"MOSCOW (AP) — The White House says President Joe Biden warned Ukraine’s president Thursday that there is a “distinct possibility” Russia could take military action against Ukraine in February. The Kremlin likewise sounded a grim note, saying it saw “little ground for optimism” in resolving the crisis after the U.S. this week again rejected Russia’s main demands. Russian officials said dialogue was still possible to end the crisis, but Biden again offered a stark warning amid growing concerns that Russian President Vladimir Putin will give the go-ahead for a further invasion of Ukrainian territory in the not-so-distant future. The White House said Biden’s comments to Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a phone call amplified concerns that administration officials have been making for some time. “President Biden said that there is a distinct possibility that the Russians could invade Ukraine in February,” White House National Security Council spokesperson Emily Horne said. “He has said this publicly and we have been warning about this for months. ” Tensions have soared in recent weeks, as the United States and its NATO allies expressed concern that a buildup of about 100,000 Russian troops near Ukraine signaled that Moscow planned to invade its ex-Soviet neighbor. Russia denies having any such designs — and has laid out a series of demands it says will improve security in Europe. But as expected, the U.S. and the Western alliance firmly rejected any concessions on Moscow’s main points Wednesday, refusing to permanently ban Ukraine from joining NATO and saying allied deployments of troops and military equipment in Eastern Europe are nonnegotiable. The U.S. did outline areas in which some of Russia’s concerns might be addressed, possibly offering a path to de-escalation. But, as it has done repeatedly for the past several weeks, Washington also warned Moscow of devastating sanctions if it invades Ukraine. In addition to penalties targeting Russian people and key economic sectors, several senior U.S. officials said Thursday with certainty that Germany would not allow a newly constructed gas pipeline to begin operations in the event of an incursion. All eyes are now on Putin, who will decide how Russia will respond amid fears that Europe could again be plunged into war. In the meantime, Biden spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart Zelenskyy on Thursday to reiterate American and allied support, including recent deliveries of U.S. military aid. Biden warned Zelenskyy that the U.S. believed there was a high degree of likelihood that Russia could invade when the ground freezes and Russian forces could attack Ukrainian territory from north of Kyiv, according to two people familiar with the conversation who were not authorized to comment publicly. Military experts have said Russia may be waiting for optimal ground conditions to move heavy equipment into Kyiv as part of any invasion. Eight years ago, Russia invaded Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in late February. Zelenskyy tweeted that he and Biden also discussed the possibility of additional financial support for Ukraine. The White House said Biden told Zelenskyy he was “exploring additional macroeconomic support to help Ukraine’s economy” as it comes under pressure as a result of Russia’s military buildup. Meanwhile, the United States announced that the U.N. Security Council will hold an open meeting Monday on what U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield called Russia’s “threatening behavior.” She said the deployment of more than 100,000 troops along Ukraine’s border and other destabilizing acts pose “a clear threat to international peace and security and the U.N. Charter.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters earlier that the response from the U.S. — and a similar one from NATO — left “little ground for optimism.” But he added that “there always are prospects for continuing a dialogue, it’s in the interests of both us and the Americans.” White House press secretary Jen Psaki was circumspect when asked whether the Biden administration saw a sliver of hope in that the Russians said they would keep communications open even as they said that they lacked optimism.. “We don’t know if the Russians are playing games on diplomacy. We hope not,” Psaki said. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the U.S. response contained some elements that could lead to “the start of a serious talk on secondary issues,” but emphasized that “the document contains no positive response on the main issue.” Those are Moscow’s demands that NATO not expand and that the alliance refrain from deploying weapons that might threaten Russia. Lavrov said top officials will submit proposals to Putin. Peskov said the Russian reaction would come soon. The evasive official comments reflect the fact that it is Putin who will single-handedly determine Russia’s next moves. He has warned of unspecified “military-technical measures” if the West refuses to heed the demands. Peskov added that Putin and Biden will decide whether they need to have another conversation following two calls last month. Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Kyiv had seen the U.S. response before it was delivered to Russia and had no objections. He tweeted it was “important that the U.S. remains in close contact with Ukraine before and after all contacts with Russia.” On a visit to Denmark, Kuleba emphasized his country’s need to strengthen its defenses. “This crisis is a moment of truth, and this is why we speak about weapons,” he said. “This is why we speak about economic sanctions. This is why we speak about the consolidated position of all of us, so that President Putin sees that there are no weak links in our defensive chain.” Germany’s Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said during a parliamentary debate on Ukraine that her government is closely coordinating its policy with allies, considering a range of options that could include the new Nord Stream 2 Russian gas pipeline to Germany. While the diplomacy sputters on, so too do maneuvers that have escalated tensions. Russia has launched a series of military drills involving motorized infantry and artillery units in southwestern Russia, warplanes in Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea, dozens of warships in the Black Sea and the Arctic, and Russian fighter jets and paratroopers in Belarus. NATO said it was bolstering its deterrence in the Baltic Sea region, and the U.S. ordered 8,500 troops on higher alert for potential deployment to Europe. As war fears mounted, thousands of Ukrainians expressed their resolve to stand up to the Russian pressure under the hashtag #UkrainiansWillResist on Twitter and Facebook. “No one will force Ukrainians to accept the Kremlin ultimatum,” wrote Andrii Levus, who initiated the campaign. Ukraine’s Interior Ministry has organized training on acting in emergency situations, with an emphasis on dealing with explosives. Beyond concerns about a possible Russian offensive in Ukraine, there also has been speculation that Moscow’s response could include military deployments to the Western Hemisphere. While a senior Russian diplomat recently refused to rule out such deployments to Cuba and Venezuela, a top Putin associate expressed skepticism Thursday at that prospect. “Cuba and Venezuela are aiming to come out of isolation and restore normal relations with the U.S. to a certain extent, so there can’t be any talk about setting up a base there as happened during the Soviet times,” Dmitry Medvedev, a deputy head of Russia’s Security Council, told Russian media. While he charged that the West is using Ukraine as a way to contain Russia, he somberly acknowledged that a Russia-NATO conflict “would be the most dramatic and simply catastrophic scenario, and I hope it will never happen.” While concerns about a possible Russian attack linger, a separatist conflict simmers in Ukraine. Following the 2014 ouster of a Kremlin-friendly president in Kyiv, Moscow annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula and backed an insurgency in the country’s eastern industrial heartland. Fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed rebels has killed over 14,000 people, and efforts to reach a settlement have stalled. Since the conflict began, Russia has been accused of sending troops and weapons to the separatists, something it has denied. On Thursday, Peskov wouldn’t comment on a proposal from the Kremlin’s main political party, United Russia, which suggested that Moscow respond to the delivery of Western weapons to Ukraine by sending arms to the rebels. He added that Putin is aware of the proposal but had no immediate reaction. ___ Associated Press writers Aamer Madhani and Matthew Lee in Washington, Edith M.

With a stroke of their pens, they delivered a death blow to the USSR, triggering shockwaves that are still reverberating three decades later in the tensions between Russia and Ukraine. The agreement they signed at the dacha in Viskuli, in the Belavezha forest near the border with Poland, declared that “the USSR ceases to exist as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality.” It also created the Commonwealth of Independent States, a loose alliance of ex-Soviet republics that still exists but carries little meaning. Two weeks later, eight other Soviet republics joined the alliance, effectively terminating the authority of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, who stepped down on Dec. 25, 1991, with the hammer and sickle flag lowered over the Kremlin. Stanislav Shushkevich, the head of the republic of Byelorussia, as Belarus was called at the time, spoke about the signing of the agreement with pride. The accord reached with Boris Yeltsin of Russia and Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine, marked a “diplomatic masterpiece,” he said. “A great empire, a nuclear superpower, split into independent countries that could cooperate with each other as closely as they wanted, and not a single drop of blood was shed,” added Shushkevich, 86, in an interview with The Associated Press. But that blood would be spilled later — in multiple conflicts across the former Soviet republics once yoked under Moscow’s tight control. One of the deadliest  began in eastern Ukraine shortly after Russia’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula, as Russian-backed separatists battled Ukrainian troops in fighting that has killed over 14,000 people. The latest Russian troop buildup on its border with Ukraine has fueled Western concerns of an invasion. During a video conference Tuesday, U.S. President Joe Biden told Russian President Vladimir Putin that Moscow will face economy-jarring sanctions if it launches an offensive against its neighbor. In his memoirs, Gorbachev expressed bitterness about the 1991 agreement, which doomed his desperate attempt to save the USSR from collapse by trying to negotiate a new “union treaty” among the republics, an effort he had begun months earlier. “What they so hastily and stealthily did in Belavezha was like a plot to kill an injured but still living person by dismembering it,” wrote Gorbachev, now 90. “The striving for power and personal interests prevailed over any legal arguments or doubts.” For Shushkevich, however, “It wasn’t a tragedy at all!” “We decided to shut the prison of nations,” he added. “There was nothing to feel contrition for.” Shushkevich argued that he and the other leaders saw no point in Gorbachev’s efforts to keep the remaining 12 Soviet republics together. The Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia already had seceded and the failed August coup against Gorbachev by hard-line members of the Communist Party had eroded his authority and encouraged other republics to seek independence. “All versions of the union treaty boiled down to the restoration of the old ways or to Gorbachev’s proposal of a new structure where he still would be the boss,” Shushkevich said. Shushkevich, Yeltsin and Kravchuk had arrived at the Viskuli lodge near the border with Poland accompanied by a few senior aides on Dec. 7. Participants later described the atmosphere as tense — everyone realized that the stakes were high and they all faced the risk of being arrested on treason charges, if Gorbachev wanted. Shushkevich noted that Eduard Shirkovsky, the head of the republic’s KGB who was at the hunting lodge, had assured him there was no threat. Years later, however, the hard-line Shirkovsky voiced regret that he didn’t order their arrest. In the AP interview, Shushkevich said he didn’t expect Gorbachev, whose power was waning rapidly, to try to arrest them. “I don’t think there was such a threat, given Gorbachev’s cowardice; at least I didn’t feel it,” he said. Gorbachev said he decided against it for fear of provoking bloodshed in a volatile situation when the loyalties of the Soviet army and law enforcement were split. “If I decided to rely on some armed structures, it would have inevitably resulted in an acute political conflict fraught with bloodshed,” he wrote. Gorbachev blamed Yeltsin, his archrival, for spearheading the Soviet collapse in a bid to take over the Kremlin. Yeltsin, who died in 2007 at the age of 76, had defended his action by saying the USSR was doomed. The Belovezha agreement, he said, was the only way to avoid a conflict between the central government and the independence-minded republics. Some participants in the historic meeting pointed to Ukraine’s Kravchuk as playing the pivotal role in the demise of the Soviet Union. Ukraine had declared its sovereignty after the August coup that dramatically weakened Gorbachev’s authority. A week before the Belovezha agreement, Kravchuk was elected president of Ukraine in a vote that also overwhelmingly approved its independence from Moscow. In the talks at the hunting lodge, Kravchuk took a forceful stand, rejecting any kind of revamped version of the Soviet Union. “Kravchuk was focused on Ukraine’s independence,” Shushkevich said. “He was proud that Ukraine declared its independence in a referendum and he was elected president on Dec. 1, 1991.” Sergei Shakhrai, a top Yeltsin aide, also said Ukraine’s vote played a decisive role. “The Ukrainian independence referendum and the subsequent decision by the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet to disavow the 1922 Treaty on creation of the USSR put a political and legal completion to the process of disintegration,” Shakhrai said. “Yeltsin and Shushkevich first tried to persuade Kravchuk to maintain some form of union, but after the referendum, he wouldn’t even like to hear that word.” After signing the agreement, Yeltsin and Kravchuk asked Shushkevich to tell Gorbachev about the deal. Yeltsin also called Soviet Defense Minister Yevgeny Shaposhnikov to discourage him from using any force if Gorbachev ordered him to do so, and later called then-U.S. President George H.W. Bush. Shushkevich recalled that Gorbachev was livid at the news declaring the Soviet Union dead. “Gorbachev told me in a mentor tone: ‘Do you know what the international community would say?’” Shushkevich said. “And I responded that I do know. By that time, the conversation with Bush already started and I was hearing it. I said that Yeltsin was telling Bush about it and he (Bush) was reacting in a positive way.” While they focused on unseating Gorbachev, the three leaders put aside disputes among themselves, but those rifts resurfaced later. Putin, who described the collapse of the Soviet Union as “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century,” has continuously alleged that Ukraine unfairly inherited historic parts of Russia in the demise of the USSR. When Ukraine’s Kremlin-friendly president was driven from power by protests in 2014, Russia responded by annexing Crimea and throwing its support behind a separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine. Amid the recent Russian troop buildup reported by Washington and Kyiv, Putin has sought guarantees from Biden that the NATO military alliance will never expand to include Ukraine, which has long sought membership. The Americans and their NATO allies said that request was a nonstarter. “Modern Ukraine is entirely the product of the Soviet era,” Putin said in an article published in July. “We know and remember well that it was shaped — for a significant part — on the lands of historical Russia. It’s crystal clear that Russia was effectively robbed.” ___ Karmanau reported from Kyiv, Ukraine.",western,1,1253,94.3,47.63,21.68,10.68,19.58,29.85,79.97,58.18,46.53,7.74,3.99,0.64,0.16,0.08,1.84,0.88,3.75,16.2,10.77,2.15,15.08,4.79,2.95,5.19,0.88,11.25,5.35,2.87,8.3,2.31,1.04,5.03,8.38,0.8,7.58,1.2,0.88,0.88,1.12,0.48,3.43,0.16,4.31,1.68,2.63,0.96,0.16,0.8,0.16,0.32,0.24,0,12.29,6.46,0.64,0.16,1.28,0.32,3.67,5.99,0,0,0,1.84,5.35,3.51,1.76,0.08,1.92,0.24,0.08,1.44,0.16,0,1.44,0.16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.8,0.08,0.24,0.32,0,0.08,0,0,0.32,0.24,2,8.3,0.56,0.88,6.15,0.08,0.24,0.48,4.23,8.38,1.2,0.4,0,0,0,0,0,18.04,5.27,6.15,0.08,0.08,1.68,4.79
650,apnews.com,2022-01-28 08:00:00,https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-crisis-live-updates-today-b81f3e2accdd6a3a08a38a18da535631,Ukraine crisis updates : What to know amid fears of a war,English,United States,"WARSAW, Poland (AP) — High-stakes diplomacy continued on Friday in a bid to avert a war in Eastern Europe. The urgent efforts come as 100,000 Russian troops are massed near Ukraine’s border and the Biden administration worries  that Russian President Vladimir Putin will mount some sort of invasion within weeks. Here are things to know about the international tensions surrounding Ukraine. PENTAGON LAYS OUT MILITARY OPTIONS Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Friday the buildup of Russian forces along Ukraine’s border has reached the point where President Vladimir Putin now has a complete range of military options, including actions short of a full-scale invasion. “While we don’t believe that President Putin has made a final decision to use these forces against Ukraine, he clearly now has the capability,” Austin told a Pentagon news conference. Austin said Putin could use any portion of his force of an estimated 100,000 troops to seize Ukrainian cities and “significant territories” or to carry out “coercive acts or provocative political acts” like the recognition of breakaway territories inside Ukraine. Austin spoke alongside Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in a news conference that marked a subtle shift in the administration’s approach to public communications about the Ukraine crisis, which until now has focused on the the diplomatic efforts. Milley said Russian forces near Ukraine include not only ground troops and naval and air forces but also cyber and electronic warfare capabilities, as well as special operations forces. But he also noted that Ukraine’s military has improved significantly over the past several years, adding, “If Russia chooses to invade Ukraine, it will not be cost free, in terms of casualties and other significant effects,” Milley said. ___ A DIPLOMATIC DEADLOCK The Kremlin said Putin told French President Emmanuel Macron that the West has failed to consider Russia’s key conditions of halting further NATO expansion, stopping the deployment of alliance weapons near Russian borders, and rolling back its forces from Eastern Europe. Putin told Macron that Moscow will study the U.S. and NATO response before deciding its next move, according to a Kremlin account of their call. A French official said Macron and Putin talked for over an hour Friday and spoke “about the necessity of de-escalation.” The official, who spoke on customary condition of anonymity, said that in the call Putin expressed commitment to the yearslong series of talks between Ukraine and Russia, with a new meeting expected in Berlin in two weeks. But he made no concessions. Putin has made no public remarks about the Western written response to the Russian demands, but Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said it leaves little chance for reaching agreement. He said Moscow will not start a war but also won’t allow the West to trample on its security interests. He noted, however, that the U.S. has suggested the two sides could talk about other issues of importance. Those include limits on the deployment of intermediate-range missiles, restrictions on military drills and rules to prevent accidents between warships and aircraft. ___ RUSSIA SUSPENDS MILITARY INSPECTIONS Germany expressed regret that Russia has suspended mutual military inspections at a time of heightened tensions. They are intended as confidence-building measures among members of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said Russia recently announced it would suspend the inspections until the end of February, citing the spread of the omicron variant. “Because of this an inspection on Russian territory in the border region of Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, which Russia had previously agreed to, won’t currently be possible,” said the spokesman, Christofer Burger. “We expressly regret this step because particularly in the current situation anything which creates greater transparency would help reduce tensions,” he said. Burger said Russia also canceled inspections it was due to conduct in Germany. ___ EXPOSING DISINFORMATION HAS ITS RISKS In a break from the past, the U.S. and its allies are increasingly revealing their intelligence findings, looking to expose Putin’s plans on Ukraine and deflect his efforts to shape world opinion. The White House in recent weeks publicized what it said was a Russian “false-flag” operation to create a pretext for an invasion. Britain named Ukrainians it accused of having ties to Russian intelligence officers plotting to overthrow Zelenskyy. The U.S. also released a map of Russian military positions and detailed how officials believe Russia will try to attack Ukraine with as many as 175,000 troops. But the release of information isn’t without risks. Intelligence assessments carry varying degrees of certainty, and beyond offering photos of troop movements, the U.S. and its allies have provided little other proof. Moscow has invoked past American intelligence failures, including false information put forward about Iraq’s weapons programs. ___ WHAT ABOUT THOSE GERMAN HOWITZERS? German government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit says a decision had not yet been reached on whether to approve Estonia’s request to transfer artillery guns to Ukraine. Germany originally owned the howitzers and sold them to Finland which then sold them to Estonia. Hebestreit on Friday warned against I’m pursuing what he called a “military logic” amid demands for German approval to deliver the howitzers to Ukraine. “When push comes to shove that wouldn’t be a real solution either,” Hebestreit said. “That’s no game changer now.” —— WILL RUSSIAN GAS KEEP FLOWING? Germany says Russia remains a reliable natural gas supplier, but is still preparing for all scenarios. Government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit made the remark on Friday amid concerns that Russia might cut natural gas supplies to Europe. “In our view the Russian gas supply contracts are being fulfilled everywhere so far and we strongly assume that this will remain the case,” Hebestreit said. “At the same time it’s clear that one needs to prepare for all eventualities, and this is what the German government is doing,” he added. ___ CAN THE US HELP EUROPE WITH GAS SUPPLIES? President Joe Biden and European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said they were working to ensure “reliable and affordable energy supplies” to the EU. Their joint declaration comes as concerns rise that Russia could cut or stem its gas supplies to Europe. The issue is expected to be at the center of talks when the U.S.-EU Energy Council meets on February 7. “The United States and the EU are working jointly towards continued, sufficient, and timely supply of natural gas to the EU from diverse sources across the globe to avoid supply shocks, including those that could result from a further Russian invasion of Ukraine,” Biden and von der Leyen said. ___ HOW IS THE UK BOOSTING ITS CYBER DEFENSES? The U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre is urging businesses to strengthen computer network protection amid the Ukraine crisis. It said Friday it’s investigating recent reports of “malicious cyber incidents” in Ukraine and that these attacks are similar to a pattern of Russian behavior during earlier conflicts. While authorities aren’t aware of any specific threats against the U.K., the center is encouraging large organizations to bolster online defenses. The center is part of GCHQ, Britain’s signals intelligence agency. ___ HOW ARE TENSIONS AFFECTING BUSINESS? Germany’s Foreign Ministry says it has denied a retired diplomat permission to work for a subsidiary of the Russian-owned gas pipeline operator. “An internal review concluded that the taking on of this role had to be denied, because it would have encroached on official interests,” a ministry spokesman said Friday. Meanwhile, Italian bank UniCredit  also decided not to pursue a possible takeover bid for Russian bank Otrkitie due to Ukraine tensions. CEO Andrea Orcel said in a media call Friday that UniCredit had started due diligence on an offer, but “given the geopolitical environment, we decided to withdraw.” ___ Associated Press writers Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow, Frank Jordans in Berlin, Colleen Barry in Milan, Danica Kirka in London, Nomaan Merchant and Lolita Baldor in Washington and Lori Hinnant in Paris contributed.",western,1,1307,90.14,43.21,39.68,19.32,22.15,32.29,78.65,54.48,41.55,6.43,1.99,0.08,0.38,0.15,0.77,0.54,4.44,12.39,7.8,0.54,14.15,5.59,2.98,5.43,1.07,12.39,5.43,1.99,7.96,1.45,1.45,5.13,10.56,0.46,10.1,2.6,2.3,1.07,1.38,0.15,3.06,0,3.44,1.68,1.76,0.31,0,0.31,0.08,0.08,0.15,0,10.1,6.2,0.61,0.23,0.54,0.08,4.21,4.21,0,0,0,1.15,5.43,3.06,1.91,0.46,3.98,0.08,0.08,3.52,0.77,0,0.23,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.15,0.08,0.54,0,0.15,0.15,0.23,0,0,0.99,0.31,2.6,9.64,0.84,1.53,7.04,0.38,0,0.38,4.21,5.05,4.21,1.15,0.31,0.31,0.15,0,0,17.14,5.36,4.44,0.38,0,1.61,5.36

Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu noted recent efforts to boost military cooperation between the two allies, including modernization of military infrastructure for shared use. After a meeting of the two countries’ military top brass, Shoigu said he and his Belarusian counterpart extended agreements on two Russian military facilities in Belarus — an early warning radar in the Brest region near Poland and a naval communications center in Vileyka near the Belarusian capital of Minsk. He didn’t specify for how long they were extended. Russia and Belarus have a union agreement envisaging close political, economic and military ties. Moscow has staunchly backed Belarus’ authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko amid Western sanctions triggered by Belarusian authorities’ crackdown on protests following his re-election to a sixth term in an August 2020. Belarus’ opposition and the West rejected the election as a sham. In a bid to secure more Kremlin support, Lukashenko has repeatedly described Belarus as a bulwark against the West and called for boosting defense ties with Russia. Russia’s relations with the U.S. and its NATO allies have sunk to post-Cold War lows after Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula and support for a separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine. Earlier this month, NATO withdrew the accreditation of eight Russian officials to its Brussels headquarters, saying it believed they had been secretly working for Russian intelligence. Russia responded Monday by suspending its mission at NATO and ordering the closure of the alliance’s office in Moscow. Moscow has repeatedly voiced concerns over the deployment of NATO forces near Russian borders, describing it as a threat to its security. Russia and the alliance also have blamed each other for conducting destabilizing military exercises near the borders. Shoigu charged Wednesday that dozens of NATO drills near Russia’s borders have been used to rehearse scenarios of military confrontation with Russia. He specifically voiced concern about a buildup of NATO troops in Poland and the Baltics, the deployment of U.S. missile defense facilities in Romania and Poland and the modernization of tactical nuclear weapons in Europe. The Russian defense minister emphasized that NATO’s activities make “a coordinated defense policy, cooperation in the development of armed forces, an increase in coordination and combat training and a shared use of military infrastructure particularly acute for Russia and Belarus.”",western,1,404,98.31,53.36,21.97,12.47,25.25,38.37,74.75,49.75,40.84,3.96,1.73,0,0,0,1.24,0.5,2.23,13.37,8.91,1.98,17.33,2.97,1.73,5.69,0.25,7.67,5.69,2.48,13.12,2.72,0.5,9.9,3.71,0,3.71,0.74,2.23,0,0,0,0.99,0,3.71,1.49,2.23,0.25,0,0.25,0,0.25,0,0,9.41,6.68,2.23,0,1.24,0.25,2.48,3.47,0,0,0,1.24,9.16,6.93,1.98,0.25,1.73,0,0.25,1.24,0.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.99,0,1.73,9.9,0.25,0.25,9.41,0,0,0,3.71,4.21,0.74,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.38,4.95,2.72,0,0,3.22,1.49

It alleged Moscow was likely to release a graphic video showing the attack on Russian territory or against Russian-speaking people in eastern Ukraine. Russia denied it was planning to fabricate an attack, and the US did not provide evidence to support the claim. The build-up of tens of thousands of Russian troops on Ukraine's borders has escalated fears of an invasion. Moscow says they are there for military drills, but Ukraine and its Western allies remain concerned that Russia is planning to launch an assault. ""We do have information that the Russians are likely to want to fabricate a pretext for an invasion,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Thursday. ""As part of this fake attack, we believe that Russia would produce a very graphic propaganda video, which would include corpses and actors that would be depicting mourners and images of destroyed locations,"" he said. But senior US officials said the video was just one of several ideas Russia has to provide a pretext to invade its neighbour. They added that the alleged plan was being revealed in an effort to dissuade Russia from invading. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded to the reports later on Thursday. ""This is not the first promise of its kind [to release details about Russian provocation],"" he said. ""Something similar was also said before, but nothing came of it."" Russia has repeatedly denied that it is planning an attack. Watch: Understand the Ukraine crisis with Ros Atkins in less than six minutes News of the alleged plot came a day after the US said it was sending more troops to eastern Europe to support allies in the Nato defensive alliance. Russia said the move was ""destructive"" and showed that its concerns about Nato's eastward expansion were justified. Also on Thursday, Nato expressed concerns that Russia was likely to deploy up to 30,000 troops - including special forces, fighter jets and short-range ballistic missiles - in Belarus, Ukraine's northern neighbour. ""This is the biggest Russian deployment there since the Cold War,"" Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said. Rivalry between Russia and the US, which still possess the world's biggest nuclear arsenals, dates back to the Cold War. Ukraine was then a crucial part of the communist Soviet Union. Russian President Vladimir Putin is currently in the Chinese capital, Beijing, for the Winter Olympics, and on Friday met his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, for their first face-to-face meeting since June 2019, because of the pandemic. The two nations have a close relationship - President Xi has previously praised Mr Putin as his ""best friend"", and it is widely expected that Russia will be looking for diplomatic support from China as tensions build with Ukraine and the West. Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron will travel to Russia and Ukraine next week to try and de-escalate the tensions. He will meet Mr Putin in the Russian capital, Moscow, on Monday, then Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky the next day.

A statement cited the ""deterioration of the situation"" in east Ukraine as one reason for keeping an estimated 30,000 Russian troops in Belarus. The move will add to fears that Russia plans an invasion of Ukraine, which shares a long border with Belarus. Western leaders have accused Moscow of seeking a pretext to send in troops. Russia has denied it plans to invade its neighbour. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the extension of military exercises shows the world is on the brink of war. The BBC's Eastern Europe correspondent Sarah Rainsford said the announcement - made by the Belarus defence ministry - is another strong signal that Russia is not prepared to back down in its stand-off with Western countries over Ukraine. In a phone call on Sunday, Mr Putin told French President Emmanuel Macron the Russian troops would eventually leave Belarus, the French presidency said. Mr Putin blamed the Ukrainian military for the escalation of tensions in the Donbas. France said the pair agreed to work for a ceasefire on the contact line in eastern Ukraine. Watch the moment Ukrainian officials run from apparent shelling in the eastern part of the country There were more explosions in the east Ukrainian conflict zone through the night and into Sunday. Detonations could be heard from the separatist-held city of Donetsk while both sides said they had come under heavy shell fire. As explosions boomed out in Donetsk on Sunday morning, Russian-backed rebels in Luhansk accused government forces of crossing the front line to mount an attack which killed two civilians. No proof was given for the allegation but Russian investigators opened an inquiry. The rebels and government forces accused each other of violating the ceasefire dozens of time on Sunday. Two Ukrainian soldiers were killed on Saturday as international monitors reported that ceasefire violations had increased dramatically this week. Thousands of civilians are being evacuated from the separatist territories into Russia while men of fighting age are being mobilised to fight. Speaking as she prepared to leave Donetsk for Russia by bus with her four-year-old daughter, an evacuee who gave her name as Tatyana told Reuters news agency: ""It's really scary. I've taken everything I could carry."" By Orla Guerin, BBC News, Novotroitske The frontlines in eastern Ukraine are rarely silent - at the very least there is sniper fire between Kremlin-backed rebels and Ukrainian forces. But now the big guns are back. In recent days there has been a barrage of artillery and mortar fire. We heard it ourselves at frontline positions in Novotroitske. We reached the trenches on foot, crossing flat ground where snow has given way to sucking layers of mud. Two fresh-faced troops led the way, standing stock still at the rumble of shelling a few kilometres away. At a sandbagged lookout position 24-year-old Taras told us there had been three days of heavy incoming fire. ""I think Putin is doing it on purpose to provoke us,"" he said. ""The situation has gotten worse, but we tolerate it, and we wait."" Ukrainian forces say they have orders not to return fire - except in exceptional cases - as Russia is ""looking for any excuse to invade"". Taras had a deadpan expression, and a phlegmatic approach to a possible invasion. ""They might raze us to the ground,"" he told me, ""and they might not. And we don't know if we will have support or not. If it gets too hard, we will open fire too."" Russia has mustered up to 190,000 troops including separatist forces in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, according to US estimates. Western leaders, meanwhile, are preparing sanctions against Russia in case of an invasion. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson told BBC News sanctions would hit ""very very hard"". He said he had seen evidence Russia is planning ""the biggest war in Europe since 1945"". The President of the European Council Charles Michel has said the EU is ready to impose massive sanctions on the Kremlin - even harming its own economy if necessary - to confront Russian military aggression. But Ukraine's President Volodymr Zelensky has accused Western leaders of a ""policy of appeasement"" towards Moscow and demanded security guarantees for Ukraine, which officially aspires to join both Nato and the EU. Mr Putin has been demanding assurances that Nato will not admit Ukraine, a former Soviet state with close ties to Russia, while the Western alliance denies it poses any threat to Russia.

The continued deployment of the Russian forces in Belarus raised concern that Russia could send those troops to sweep down on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, a city of about 3 million people less than a three-hour drive away. In what appeared to be a last-ditch diplomatic gambit brokered with the aid of French President Emmanuel Macron, the White House said U.S. President Joe Biden has agreed “in principle” to a meeting with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin as long as he holds off on launching an assault that U.S. officials warn appears increasingly more likely. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the administration has been clear that “we are committed to pursuing diplomacy until the moment an invasion begins.” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov are set to meet on Thursday in Europe — as long as Russia does not send its troops into Ukraine beforehand. “We are always ready for diplomacy. We are also ready to impose swift and severe consequences should Russia instead choose war,” Psaki said in statement. “And currently, Russia appears to be continuing preparations for a full-scale assault on Ukraine very soon.” In Kyiv, life outwardly continued as usual for many on a mild winter Sunday, with brunches and church services, ahead of what Biden said late last week was an already decided-upon Russian attack. Katerina Spanchak, who fled a region of eastern Ukraine when it was taken over by Russian-allied separatists, was among worshippers crowded into the capital’s St. Michael’s monastery, smoky with the candles burned by the faithful, to pray that Ukraine be spared. “We all love life, and we are all united by our love of life,” Spanchak said, pausing to compose herself. “We should appreciate it every day. That’s why I think everything will be fine.” “Our joint prayers will help to elude this tragedy, which is advancing,” said another worshipper, who identified himself only by his first name, Oleh. A U.S. official said Sunday that Biden’s assertion that Putin has made the decision to roll Russian forces into Ukraine was based on intelligence that Russian front-line commanders have been given orders to begin final preparations for an attack. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the sensitive intelligence. The United States and many European countries have charged for weeks that Putin has built up the forces he needs to invade Ukraine — a westward-looking democracy that has sought to move out of Russia’s orbit — and is now trying to create pretexts to invade. Western nations have threatened massive sanctions if Putin does. U.S. officials on Sunday defended their decision to hold off on their planned financial punishments of Russia ahead of any invasion, after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called passionately Saturday for the West to do more. “If you pull the trigger on that deterrent, well then, it doesn’t exist anymore as a deterrent,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told Fox on Washington’s sanctions threat. Russia held nuclear drills Saturday as well as the conventional exercises in Belarus, and has ongoing naval drills off the coast in the Black Sea. The announcement that Russia was reversing its pledge to withdraw its forces from Belarus came after two days of sustained shelling along a contact line between Ukraine’s soldiers and Russian-allied separatists in eastern Ukraine, an area that Ukraine and the West worry could be the flashpoint in igniting conflict. Biden convened the National Security Council at the White House on Russia’s military buildup around Ukraine. White House officials released no immediate details of their roughly two hours of discussion. “We’re talking about the potential for war in Europe,” U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris said earlier Sunday at a security conference in Munich, Germany, that saw urgent consultations among world leaders on the crisis. “It’s been over 70 years, and through those 70 years ... there has been peace and security.” Zelenskyy on Sunday appealed on Twitter for a cease-fire. Russia has denied plans to invade, but the Kremlin did not respond to Zelenskyy’s offer Saturday to meet with Putin. After a call with Macron, Putin blamed Ukraine — incorrectly, according to observers there — for the escalation of shelling along the contact line and NATO for “pumping modern weapons and ammunition” into Ukraine. Macron, a leader in European efforts to broker a peaceful resolution with Russia, also spoke separately to Zelenskyy, to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and to Biden. Blinken intentionally raised the prospect of a Biden-Putin summit in interviews with U.S. television networks on Sunday, in a bid to keep diplomacy alive, a senior U.S. official said. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss U.S. reasoning. Blinken said that Biden was “prepared to meet President Putin at any time in any format if that can help prevent a war” and the U.S. official said Macron had then conveyed the offer of talks to Putin — conditioned on Russia not invading — in his phone calls with the Russian leader. Tensions mounted further, however. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow issued an advisory urging greater caution by Americans in Russia overall. “Have evacuation plans that do not rely on U.S. government assistance,” it warned. Immediate worries focused on eastern Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces have been fighting the pro-Russia rebels since 2014 in a conflict that has killed some 14,000 people. In the eastern Ukraine regions of Lugansk and Donetsk, separatist leaders have ordered a full military mobilization and sent more civilians to Russia, which has issued about 700,000 passports to residents of the rebel-held territories. Claims that Russian citizens are being endangered might be used as justification for military action. Officials in the separatist territories claimed Ukrainian forces launched several artillery attacks over the past day and that two civilians were killed during an unsuccessful assault on a village near the Russian border. Ukraine’s military said two soldiers died in firing from the separatist side on Saturday. “When tension is escalated to the maximum, as it is now, for example, on the line of contact, then any spark, any unplanned incident or any minor planned provocation can lead to irreparable consequences,” Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said in an interview that aired Sunday on Russian state television. On the front lines, Ukrainian soldiers said they were under orders not to return fire. Zahar Leshushun, peering into the distance with a periscope, had followed the news all day from a trench where he is posted near the town of Zolote. “Right now, we don’t respond to their fire because ...” the soldier said before the sound of an incoming shell interrupted him. “Oh! They are shooting at us now. They are aiming at the command post.” ___ Heintz reported from Moscow and Miller from Washington.

REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov MOSCOW/OSLO, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Russia increased its flow of gas to Europe via Poland and Belarus as well as Ukraine on Wednesday, easing some of Europe's concerns about tight supplies before winter and pushing down wholesale prices. Low flows to Europe and reverse flows on the Yamal-Europe pipeline last week - meaning gas flowed eastwards into Poland instead of westbound into Germany - had worsened a supply squeeze in Europe that has driven up prices for industry and consumers. But Russia started pumping gas to Germany again late on Monday, acting on an order by President Vladimir Putin to increase supplies to Europe and rebuild Russian inventories there once domestic storage tanks were replenished. On Tuesday, Russian state gas company Gazprom (GAZP.MM) said it had started to refill its European gas storage. This pushed down spot prices  in the region although analysts said Moscow would have to do more to ease concerns in Europe to lead to a more significant drop.  read more Entry flows into Germany via the Yamal-Europe pipeline, which runs through Belarus and Poland, had risen to around 12.5 million kilowatt hours (kWh) per hour at the Mallnow metering point on the Polish border, up from 9.8 million kWh/hour most of the previous day, data on German transmission company Gascade's website showed. read more While Mallnow flows were at their highest volume in weeks, they remained ""well below"" levels seen in September, analysts at data company Refinitiv said in a note. ""The flows are unlikely to keep growing as only 325 GWh/d of Mallnow's entry capacity was booked for November,"" they said. Despite their comments, Gazprom booked additional within-day capacity at Mallnow on Wednesday morning, increasing its flow to Germany further, said Tom Marzec-Manser, head of gas analytics at commodity intelligence service ICIS. Meanwhile, nominations for flows at Velke Kapusany on the Slovak-Ukraine border, stood at 94.3 million cubic metres (mcm) per day, the highest daily nomination this year, website data from Eustream, the Slovak transmission system operator, showed. That was up from 85.2 mcm/day on Tuesday. In a sign of concerns in Europe easing, the Dutch front-month gas contract  - a European benchmark - fell as much as 9% to its lowest level since Nov. 2 on Wednesday, and was still down nearly 4% at 67.40 euros per megawatt hour (MWh) by 1430 GMT. ""Further daily capacity bookings above the 30mcm/day rate at Mallnow later this week and month will reassure the market further. But we would need a significant increase at Mallnow, with onward injections into storages, to really offset the withdrawals occurring at non-Gazprom owned units and therefore improve the supply view into Q1 2022,"" Marzec-Manser said. Gas prices have risen this year because of factors including low gas inventories and increased demand following the economic recovery since the easing of COVID-19 lockdowns, as well as tighter-than-usual supplies from Russia. In Britain, some energy companies have gone bust, consumers face much higher energy bills and companies in many sectors including food production and agriculture have felt the pain. Internet data displayed by Gazprom-owned German storage company Astora showed the Rehden storage facility in Germany had been steadily receiving 406,875 kWh per hour of gas from early Tuesday. At Germany's Jemgum storage facility, and Austria's Haidach, there were no receipts on Wednesday morning but volumes were being withdrawn at rates of 1,115,086 kWh/h and 3,772,347 kWh/ respectively. Overall European gas storage levels stood at 75.6% of capacity on Monday compared with 93.9% a year earlier, data from infrastructure group GIE showed. The resumption of Russian gas flows to Germany at Mallnow and small storage injections Rehden have calmed traders' nerves, Emily McClain, senior gas markets analyst at Rystad energy, said in a weekly report. ""How much they can send is still unclear, but based on historical trade flows during the Oct-November period, we estimate that around 2 BCM (billion cubic metres] of additional volumes may be available before the end of the year. What is clear, however, is that this remains less than adequate for a severe winter,"" McClain added. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

Russian President Vladimir Putin will personally oversee Saturday’s exercise, which will involve multiple practice launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles and cruise missiles, the Defense Ministry said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin would observe the drills from the Defense Ministry’s situation room and supervise the practice missile launches himself. The ministry said it planned the maneuvers some time ago to check the readiness of Russia’s military command and personnel, as well as the reliability of its nuclear and conventional weapons. The war games follow U.S. President Joe Biden’s warning  on Thursday that Russia could invade Ukraine within days. Western fears focus on an estimated 150,000 Russian troops — including about 60% of Russia’s overall ground forces — concentrated near Ukraine’s borders. The Kremlin insists it has no plans to invade. But Moscow has demanded that the U.S. and its allies keep Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations out of NATO, not deploy weapons in Ukraine and pull back NATO forces from Eastern Europe. Washington and its allies bluntly rejected the Russian demands, and Moscow threatened to take unspecified “military-technical measures” if the West continued to stonewall. Russia holds massive drills of its strategic nuclear forces on an annual basis, but the maneuvers planned for Saturday pointedly involve the Black Sea Fleet. The fleet is based on the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. The Black Sea Fleet has surface warships and submarines equipped with Kalibr cruise missiles, but its doesn’t have intercontinental ballistic missiles and didn’t take part in similar previous drills of the country’s strategic forces. In the past, Russia has held the annual strategic forces drills in the fall. U.S. officials have voiced concern that Moscow shifted the exercise to February to coincide with a possible invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin’s Peskov said Russia notified foreign partners about the maneuvers in advance, adding that the exercise shouldn’t cause worries in the West. “Practice launches of ballistic missiles are part of regular training,” he said. “They are preceded by a series of notices to other nations via different channels.” Putin met with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko and invited him to watch Saturday’s maneuvers. The authoritarian Lukashenko, who has edged closer to Moscow amid Western sanctions for his crackdown on domestic protests, has offered to host Russian nuclear weapons. in Belarus, which neighbors Ukraine to the north. The strategic forces of both Russia and the United States include a nuclear triad of land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-based ICBMs and nuclear-capable bombers. The exercise of Russia’s nuclear forces follows a series of sweeping drills that the Russian military held near Ukraine and in Belarus. The Russian military said it started pulling some of troops massed near Ukraine back to their permanent bases after the drills. The U.S. and its allies questioned the claim and said that Moscow has actually moved thousands of new troops closer to Ukraine. Moscow argued that the pullback takes time and rejected Western criticism, saying that it would deploy troops wherever it’s necessary to ensure national security. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the tension between Russia and Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",western,1,551,95.22,40.06,24.61,6.26,21.19,36.66,74.77,52.27,38.48,5.63,1.27,0,0,0,0.73,0.36,4.36,13.25,8.71,0.73,13.61,4.36,1.09,4.9,0.91,9.98,7.8,2.9,11.62,1.63,2,7.99,8.53,0.18,8.35,1.09,2,0.73,1.09,0.18,2.72,0.18,3.45,0.91,2.54,0.91,0,0.91,0.54,0.18,0,0,8.35,5.44,1.09,0,1.63,0,2.54,3.63,0,0,0,1.09,6.53,3.63,1.45,1.45,2,0.54,0.54,0.91,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.18,0,0.54,0.36,0,0,0,0.54,0,1.81,10.71,1.63,1.81,6.9,0.73,0,0.18,3.27,3.99,3.27,1.45,0.18,0.18,0,0,0,16.15,6.17,3.27,0,0,2.9,3.81

Week ahead may decide Ukraine fate",English,United States,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Even if a Russian invasion of Ukraine doesn’t happen in the next few days, the crisis is reaching a critical inflection point with European stability and the future of East-West relations hanging in the balance. A convergence of events over the coming week could determine whether the stalemate is resolved peacefully or Europe is at war. At stake are Europe’s post-Cold War security architecture and long-agreed limits on the deployment of conventional military and nuclear forces there. “This next 10 days or so will be critical,” said Ian Kelly, a retired career diplomat and former U.S. ambassador to Georgia who now teaches international relations at Northwestern University. The Biden administration on Friday said an invasion could happen at any moment, with a possible target date of Wednesday, according to intelligence picked up by the United States, and Washington was evacuating almost all of its embassy staff  in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital. A phone call between President Joe Biden and Russian leader Vladimir Putin on Saturday did nothing to ease tensions. Biden and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, spoke on Sunday. Even before the latest U.S. warnings and diplomatic moves, analysts saw this as a critical week for the future of Ukraine. “Russia and the United States are approaching a peak of the conflict of their interests regarding a future shape of the European order,” Timofei Bordachev, said head of the Center for European Research at Moscow’s Higher School of Economics. “The parties may take action against each other that will go much farther than what was considered admissible quite recently,” he said in a recent analysis. In the week ahead, Washington and NATO are expecting Moscow’s formal response after they rejected its main security demands, and major Russian military drills in Belarus, conducted as part of a deployment near Ukraine, are to end. The fate of the Russian troops now in Belarus will be key to judging the Kremlin’s intentions. At the same time, the Winter Olympics in China, often cited as a potential deterrent to immediate Russian action, will conclude Feb. 20. Although U.S. officials have said they believe an invasion could take place before then, the date is still considered important. And an important international security conference is taking place in Munich next weekend, with Vice President Kamala Harris, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and top European officials planning to attend. Putin has warned the West that he will not back down on his demand to keep Ukraine out of NATO.  While Ukraine has long aspired to join, the alliance is not about to offer an invitation. Still, he contends that if Ukraine becomes a member and tries to use force to reclaim the Crimean Peninsula annexed by Moscow in 2014, it would draw Russia and NATO into a conflict. His foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, has asked Western nations to explain how they interpret the principle of the “indivisibility of security” enshrined in international agreements they signed. The Russian Foreign Ministry said on Friday that it would not accept a collective response from the European Union and NATO, insisting on an individual response from each country. Seeking to counter NATO’s argument that every nation is free to choose alliances, Moscow has charged that NATO violated the principle and jeopardized Russia’s security by expanding eastward. “Russia’s bold demands and equally blunt U.S. rejection of them have pushed the international agenda toward the confrontation more than ever since the height of the Cold War,” Bordachev said. He argued that closer relations with China have strengthened Moscow’s hand. “Whatever goals Russia could pursue now, it can plan its future in conditions of a full rupture of ties with the West,” Bordachev said. Russian officials have emphasized that negotiating a settlement over Ukraine depends squarely on the United States and that Western allies just march to Washington’s orders. In the past, Russia had sought to build close contacts with France and Germany in the hope that friendly ties with Europe’s biggest economies would help offset the U.S. pressure. But those ties were strained by the poisoning in 2020 of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who spent five months in Germany convalescing from what he described as a nerve agent attack he blamed on the Kremlin. Russia has denied its involvement. More recently, Russian officials have criticized the position of France and Germany in the deadlocked peace talks on eastern Ukraine, holding them responsible for the failure to persuade Ukrainian authorities to grant broad self-rule to the Russia-backed separatist region, as required by a 2015 agreement. In a break with diplomatic rules, the Russian Foreign Ministry last fall published confidential letters that Lavrov exchanged with his French and German counterparts in a bid to prove their failure to help make progress in talks. Speaking after the latest fruitless round of those talks, Kremlin representative Dmitry Kozak bemoaned the failure by French and German envoys to persuade Ukraine to commit to a dialogue with the separatists, as the agreement stipulated. Despite the tensions with both Paris and Berlin, Putin spent more than five hours talking to French President Emmanuel Macron last Monday and will host German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Tuesday. Putin said he was grateful to Macron for trying to help negotiate a way to ease the tensions and said they would talk again. Moscow also just reopened a window for diplomatic contacts with Britain, hosting the foreign and defense secretaries for the first round of talks since ties were ruptured by the 2018 poisoning in Britain of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter. Lavrov’s meeting with Liz Truss was frosty, but British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace’s talks with Russia’s defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, appeared more businesslike, with the parties emphasizing the need to maintain regular contact to reduce the threat of military incidents. ___ Isachenkov reported from Moscow.",western,1,966,96.47,47.42,32.58,16.68,26.11,30.85,80.95,56.83,43.06,4.87,2.28,0,0,0,1.14,0.93,2.59,13.35,9.11,0.93,16.25,4.97,1.97,5.69,0.52,10.77,7.04,3,7.76,1.45,1.14,5.28,8.39,0.41,7.76,1.55,1.55,1.35,1.35,0.1,2.48,0,4.87,2.28,2.59,0.62,0.31,0.31,0,0.31,0,0,11.49,7.04,0.83,0.41,1.24,0.21,4.04,4.24,0.1,0,0.1,1.24,6.52,4.04,2.28,0.21,3.62,0.41,0.1,2.69,0.52,0,0.52,0.21,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.62,0.21,0.52,0.1,0.1,0,0.1,1.04,0.21,3.11,9.11,0.52,1.14,7.25,0.21,0,0.41,5.69,3.73,3.11,2.17,0,0,0,0,0,13.66,4.87,4.87,0,0,1.66,2.28
135,bbc.co.uk,2022-01-26 08:00:00,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60149444,Ukraine crisis : united kingdom  not optimistic  Russian invasion can be stopped,English,United Kingdom,"UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace is in Europe to build momentum for sanctions against Russia and support for Ukraine amid fears of another invasion. Mr Wallace has also confirmed that he'll soon be travelling to Moscow for talks with Russia's Defence Minister, Sergei Shoigu. But he's lowering expectations of any diplomatic breakthrough. He told the BBC there's still ""a chance"" that an invasion by Russia could be stopped, but he added ""I'm not optimistic"". The UK's response to Russia's military build up has, in the words of one foreign diplomat, been ""more muscular than most"". Over the past week the UK supplied Ukraine with 2,000 light anti-tank weapons and troops to help train them. But not all Nato allies are willing to do the same. Mr Wallace wants to help change their mind. The Netherlands, Mr Wallace's first stop, is now considering sending body armour and sniper rifles to Ukraine. But others appear to be reluctant. Germany's new government continues to resist that pressure. In a news conference with Mr Wallace in Berlin the new German Defence Minister, Christine Lambrecht, warned that supplying Ukraine with weapons could ""escalate"" the conflict. Poland and Latvia have both publicly criticised Germany's stance. Instead Berlin is supplying Ukraine with so called ""non-lethal"" aid including field hospitals and 5,000 military helmets. One defence source said Mr Wallace hoped to put ""some lead in their pencil"". He's still hopeful that the Germans will support tough economic sanctions. He sees the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, built to supply gas from Russia, as one of the key bargaining chips in any sanctions package. Germany gets around 40% of its gas supplies from Russia. Under pressure from the US, the UK and Poland the new German government has now agreed to at least consider keeping the taps of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline closed - if President Putin uses military force against Ukraine. Ben Wallace said ""Nord Stream 2 is a genuine piece of leverage which we should use for the greater benefit of all allies in Europe"". At Nato's headquarters in Brussels, the British Defence Secretary discussed options for reinforcing the alliance's Eastern flank. The US, UK and France have signalled they're willing to beef up their military presence - should Russia attack Ukraine. Nato has already deployed battle-groups to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland in response to Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014. The alliance is now considering bolstering its forces in the Baltic states as well as sending troops to Romania and Bulgaria. Following his meeting with Nato's Secretary General, Mr Wallace said the UK could support Nato members by ""increasing forces on land sea or air to make sure we support them in acting as a deterrent to any further Russian aggressions"". He said the UK would now consider the options. The UK is also not ruling out sending more weapons to Ukraine. Western defence and intelligence sources say Russia is continuing its military build up. They say Russia now has 40% of its deployable army on the border with Ukraine. For the first time since World War Two Russia has moved troops from the east of the country to the Ukraine border. There are now, according to Western intelligence sources, an estimated 30,000 Russian troops in Belarus, close to Ukraine's border and they're due to conduct military exercises next month. In all Russia is believed to have massed more than 100,000 troops, tanks, artillery and missiles on Ukraine's border.

Dr. Hans Kluge said the 53-country region, which stretches to former Soviet republics into central Asia, has now tallied more than 165 million confirmed coronavirus cases and 1.8 million deaths linked to the pandemic — including 25,000 in the last week alone. “Today, our focus is towards the east of the WHO European region,” Kluge said in Russian at a media briefing, pointing to a surge in the highly transmissible omicron variant. “Over the past two weeks, cases of COVID-19 have more than doubled in six countries in this part of the region (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine).” “As anticipated, the omicron wave is moving east: 10 eastern Member States have now detected this variant,” he said. Omicron, however, is milder than previous variants and health care systems in most countries around the world aren’t under strain. Kluge sought to put an emphasis on improving vaccination rates, which have lagged in Eastern Europe compared to the rest of the region. He said less than 40% of people over age 60 in Bosnia, Bulgaria, Kyrgyzstan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan have completed a full COVID-19 vaccine series. He called on governments and health officials “to closely examine the local reasons influencing lower vaccine demand and acceptance, and devise tailored interventions to increase vaccination rates urgently, based on the context-specific evidence.” He also said it was “not the moment to lift measures that we know work in reducing the spread of COVID-19.” The WHO Europe chief also highlighted his “message of hope” — pointing to high levels of immunity through vaccination or recovery from infection, and the looming end of the winter season that causes many people to gather indoors, where the virus can spread more easily. ___ Follow AP’s pandemic coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic",western,1,345,95.89,35.09,74.45,27.94,28.75,28.41,80.29,55.94,42.9,5.22,2.9,0,0.58,0,1.45,0.29,2.32,14.78,8.41,5.51,15.65,3.77,2.9,5.22,0.58,9.28,6.09,8.12,2.9,0.87,0.58,1.45,7.54,0,6.96,1.16,1.16,0.58,0.58,0,4.06,0,2.9,1.74,1.16,0.87,0.29,0.58,0.29,0,0,0,6.38,2.9,0.29,0,0,0,2.32,3.19,0,0,0,1.45,2.32,0.87,1.16,0.29,0.87,0,0,0.87,0,0,6.67,6.09,4.64,0,0,0,0,0,0.29,0.29,0.29,0.58,0,0.58,0,0,0.29,0.29,3.77,15.07,1.45,1.45,12.17,0.29,0,0,4.93,4.06,2.9,0.87,0.29,0.29,0,0,0,21.45,4.06,7.54,0,0,0.87,8.99

Within hours, the Collective Security Treaty Organization, or CSTO, announced its readiness to accept the plea for assistance. By Thursday, planeloads of Russian elite airborne units were flying into Kazakhstan. Kazakh Deputy Foreign Minister Shukhrat Nuryshev said 2,500 CSTO peacekeepers would be deployed. This marks the first time the CSTO has been engaged in an active operation. WHAT IS THE CSTO? The Collective Security Treaty Organization was formed in the first half of the 1990s following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Besides Russia, it includes Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. Despite its name, the bloc has at times struggled to define its exact purpose. Failure to engage in numerous security crises among its members over the years has prompted security analysts to question its viability. Last spring, two members, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, were engaged in a messy and bloody border dispute. The CSTO looked on impassively. The bloc’s focus has instead been aimed more intensely on enhancing readiness for potential spillover from Afghanistan, which shares a long border with Tajikistan. Russia has around 7,000 troops stationed in that country. WHY DID KAZAKHSTAN SUMMON CSTO SUPPORT? To legitimize his plea for outside military help, Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev went on television late Wednesday to say the unrest was being perpetrated by “international terrorist groups.” This framing was important because the CSTO is ostensibly designed to protect member states from external aggression. It’s unclear, however, which outside groups might be allegedly fomenting the trouble in Kazakhstan. The current crisis began at the start of this week with peaceful protests over the sudden rise in car fuel prices. As large rallies began springing up across the country, and as violence broke out in Almaty, the country’s commercial capital, reports emerged in some locations that law enforcement was declining to suppress the gatherings, which is the normal protocol in Kazakhstan. This has fueled speculation that Tokayev, who became president in 2019, was growing nervous over the loyalty of his security apparatus. WHAT IS THE CSTO MISSION? The Russian Defense Ministry says its troops are being flown into Kazakhstan on 70 Il-76 and five An-124 heavy transport aircraft. Russian military transports will also bring in the troops from Belarus, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia. Russia’s component is being drawn from units in the army specially trained for rapid reaction operations: the 45th Guards Special Purpose brigade, the 98th Guards Airborne Division and the 31st Separate Guards Order. A group of troops from the 98th Guards Airborne Division was captured by Ukrainian armed forces while apparently involved in covert military operations in the war in eastern Ukraine in 2014. Russia claimed they had crossed the border by mistake. The mission in Kazakhstan will be led by Andrei Serdyukov, 59, the overall commander of Russian Airborne Troops. HOW DO KAZAKHS VIEW CSTO INVOLVEMENT? The sight of Russian troops patrolling the streets of their country will provoke deeply ambivalent feelings among Kazakhs. Kazakhstan is a close and loyal ally to Moscow and feelings toward Russia are typically positive. There is, nevertheless, intense anxiety over Russia’s historically aggressive behavior toward its neighbors. The Kremlin cited alleged concerns over the oppression of ethnic Russians in Ukraine when it annexed Crimea in 2014. Kazakhstan, whose lands were conquered by the Russian Empire during the 19th century, has a large ethnic Russian population in its northern regions and nationalist politicians in Moscow routinely talk about the need to one day intervene on their behalf. In an interview with Russian state news agency RIA Novosti, CSTO Secretary General Stanislav Zas scoffed at talk that the bloc’s troops were a cover for imposing Russian authority over Kazakhstan. “There has been some gibberish about how this is an invasion or something,” he said. “Well, I’m sorry, this is just completely stupid.” Tokayev will nevertheless face questions from his own people about whether his eagerness to welcome foreign troops has not diluted Kazakhstan’s sovereignty. Invasion or not, the damage has been done. HOW LONG WILL CSTO TROOPS STAY? As long as it takes, Zas told RIA Novosti. That could mean days or even weeks. The official position is that Kazakhstan only has to say the word and CSTO troops will leave. Russian troops have already been deployed at the airport in Almaty, where the most serious unrest has occurred. Although Nuryshev, the deputy foreign minister, said around 2,500 CSTO troops in total are being deployed in Kazakhstan, Russian media has reported a figure of 3,000 troops among Russia’s mission alone. Kazakhstan’s government said Friday that “constitutional order” had been restored all across the country, but that disturbances were still persisting in Almaty.",western,1,799,90.68,54.98,40.33,12.39,17.37,33.29,81.48,54.57,43.8,5.38,1.38,0.13,0,0,0.63,0.38,4.01,12.89,8.14,2.75,14.64,8.51,3.88,3.88,0.25,12.77,6.26,3.38,9.39,3.63,0.5,5.38,7.38,0.13,7.26,1.38,1.5,0.5,2,0.25,2.38,0,4.01,1.63,2.38,0.63,0,0.5,0.25,0.25,0,0.13,10.26,4.51,1.25,0.13,0.5,0.13,2,5.38,0,0.13,0,0.63,7.51,2.88,4.38,0.25,2,0.13,0.13,1.5,0.25,0,0.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.63,0,0.38,0,0,0,0.13,1.25,0,2.88,12.39,0.13,1.25,9.76,0.75,0.13,0.38,3,5.13,4.01,1.25,0,0,0,0,0,15.02,5.13,6.01,0.63,0,1.38,1.88

The Kremlin likewise sounded a grim note, saying it saw “little ground for optimism” in resolving the crisis after the U.S. this week again rejected Russia’s main demands. Russian officials said dialogue was still possible to end the crisis, but Biden again offered a stark warning amid growing concerns that Russian President Vladimir Putin will give the go-ahead for a further invasion of Ukrainian territory in the not-so-distant future. The White House said Biden’s comments to Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a phone call amplified concerns that administration officials have been making for some time. “President Biden said that there is a distinct possibility that the Russians could invade Ukraine in February,” White House National Security Council spokesperson Emily Horne said. “He has said this publicly and we have been warning about this for months. ” Tensions have soared in recent weeks, as the United States and its NATO allies expressed concern that a buildup of about 100,000 Russian troops near Ukraine signaled that Moscow planned to invade its ex-Soviet neighbor. Russia denies having any such designs — and has laid out a series of demands it says will improve security in Europe. But as expected, the U.S. and the Western alliance firmly rejected any concessions on Moscow’s main points Wednesday, refusing to permanently ban Ukraine from joining NATO and saying allied deployments of troops and military equipment in Eastern Europe are nonnegotiable. The U.S. did outline areas in which some of Russia’s concerns might be addressed, possibly offering a path to de-escalation. But, as it has done repeatedly for the past several weeks, Washington also warned Moscow of devastating sanctions if it invades Ukraine. In addition to penalties targeting Russian people and key economic sectors, several senior U.S. officials said Thursday with certainty that Germany would not allow a newly constructed gas pipeline to begin operations in the event of an incursion. All eyes are now on Putin, who will decide how Russia will respond amid fears that Europe could again be plunged into war. In the meantime, Biden spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart Zelenskyy on Thursday to reiterate American and allied support, including recent deliveries of U.S. military aid. Biden warned Zelenskyy that the U.S. believed there was a high degree of likelihood that Russia could invade when the ground freezes and Russian forces could attack Ukrainian territory from north of Kyiv, according to two people familiar with the conversation who were not authorized to comment publicly. Military experts have said Russia may be waiting for optimal ground conditions to move heavy equipment into Kyiv as part of any invasion. Eight years ago, Russia invaded Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in late February. Zelenskyy tweeted that he and Biden also discussed the possibility of additional financial support for Ukraine. The White House said Biden told Zelenskyy he was “exploring additional macroeconomic support to help Ukraine’s economy” as it comes under pressure as a result of Russia’s military buildup. Meanwhile, the United States announced that the U.N. Security Council will hold an open meeting Monday on what U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield called Russia’s “threatening behavior.” She said the deployment of more than 100,000 troops along Ukraine’s border and other destabilizing acts pose “a clear threat to international peace and security and the U.N. Charter.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters earlier that the response from the U.S. — and a similar one from NATO — left “little ground for optimism.” But he added that “there always are prospects for continuing a dialogue, it’s in the interests of both us and the Americans.” White House press secretary Jen Psaki was circumspect when asked whether the Biden administration saw a sliver of hope in that the Russians said they would keep communications open even as they said that they lacked optimism.. “We don’t know if the Russians are playing games on diplomacy. We hope not,” Psaki said. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the U.S. response contained some elements that could lead to “the start of a serious talk on secondary issues,” but emphasized that “the document contains no positive response on the main issue.” Those are Moscow’s demands that NATO not expand and that the alliance refrain from deploying weapons that might threaten Russia. Lavrov said top officials will submit proposals to Putin. Peskov said the Russian reaction would come soon. The evasive official comments reflect the fact that it is Putin who will single-handedly determine Russia’s next moves. He has warned of unspecified “military-technical measures” if the West refuses to heed the demands. Peskov added that Putin and Biden will decide whether they need to have another conversation following two calls last month. Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Kyiv had seen the U.S. response before it was delivered to Russia and had no objections. He tweeted it was “important that the U.S. remains in close contact with Ukraine before and after all contacts with Russia.” On a visit to Denmark, Kuleba emphasized his country’s need to strengthen its defenses. “This crisis is a moment of truth, and this is why we speak about weapons,” he said. “This is why we speak about economic sanctions. This is why we speak about the consolidated position of all of us, so that President Putin sees that there are no weak links in our defensive chain.” Germany’s Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said during a parliamentary debate on Ukraine that her government is closely coordinating its policy with allies, considering a range of options that could include the new Nord Stream 2 Russian gas pipeline to Germany. While the diplomacy sputters on, so too do maneuvers that have escalated tensions. Russia has launched a series of military drills involving motorized infantry and artillery units in southwestern Russia, warplanes in Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea, dozens of warships in the Black Sea and the Arctic, and Russian fighter jets and paratroopers in Belarus. NATO said it was bolstering its deterrence in the Baltic Sea region, and the U.S. ordered 8,500 troops on higher alert for potential deployment to Europe. As war fears mounted, thousands of Ukrainians expressed their resolve to stand up to the Russian pressure under the hashtag #UkrainiansWillResist on Twitter and Facebook. “No one will force Ukrainians to accept the Kremlin ultimatum,” wrote Andrii Levus, who initiated the campaign. Ukraine’s Interior Ministry has organized training on acting in emergency situations, with an emphasis on dealing with explosives. Beyond concerns about a possible Russian offensive in Ukraine, there also has been speculation that Moscow’s response could include military deployments to the Western Hemisphere. While a senior Russian diplomat recently refused to rule out such deployments to Cuba and Venezuela, a top Putin associate expressed skepticism Thursday at that prospect. “Cuba and Venezuela are aiming to come out of isolation and restore normal relations with the U.S. to a certain extent, so there can’t be any talk about setting up a base there as happened during the Soviet times,” Dmitry Medvedev, a deputy head of Russia’s Security Council, told Russian media. While he charged that the West is using Ukraine as a way to contain Russia, he somberly acknowledged that a Russia-NATO conflict “would be the most dramatic and simply catastrophic scenario, and I hope it will never happen.” While concerns about a possible Russian attack linger, a separatist conflict simmers in Ukraine. Following the 2014 ouster of a Kremlin-friendly president in Kyiv, Moscow annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula and backed an insurgency in the country’s eastern industrial heartland. Fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed rebels has killed over 14,000 people, and efforts to reach a settlement have stalled. Since the conflict began, Russia has been accused of sending troops and weapons to the separatists, something it has denied. On Thursday, Peskov wouldn’t comment on a proposal from the Kremlin’s main political party, United Russia, which suggested that Moscow respond to the delivery of Western weapons to Ukraine by sending arms to the rebels. He added that Putin is aware of the proposal but had no immediate reaction. ___ Associated Press writers Aamer Madhani and Matthew Lee in Washington, Edith M.

""Such actions are unjustified and discriminatory. Individual licensing regime means manual control of the import of Ukrainian products to Belarus,"" he said. Kachka said the government was talking to producers to try to reduce the negative effects of the licences. Ukrainian energy analysts said Minsk also suspended fuel supplies to Ukraine. The energy ministry said it could not confirm this but added that the country had sufficient petrol reserves. On Wednesday, Ukraine's state energy regulatory authority ruled to ban electricity imports from Belarus and its closest ally, Russia, as they are not members of the Energy Community (of South East Europe). Since Soviet times, Ukraine has been connected to the energy systems of neighbouring states and at the beginning of this year imported energy due to a lack of domestic power generation.

Belarusian authorities searched the offices of the Novy Chas (New Time) newspaper in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, and confiscated its computers and other office equipment. They also raided the apartments of newspaper editor Aksana Kolb and reporter Siarhei Pulsha, and took them for questioning that lasted for most of the day. No charges were immediately announced. The newspaper extensively covered massive protests that erupted after President Alexander Lukashenko’s re-election to a sixth term in an August 2020 presidential vote that was denounced as rigged by the opposition and the West. The Belarusian authorities have responded with a sweeping crackdown that saw more than 35,000 people arrested and thousands beaten by police. One of Novy Chas’ journalists, Dzianis Ivashyn, has been in custody since his arrest in March following a series of investigative articles about the authorities’ clampdown on protests. He faces up to three years in prison if convicted on charges of “interference with police action.” Overall, 28 Belarusian journalists are in custody, serving their sentences or awaiting trial. They include Hienadz Mazheyka, a Belarusian journalist for the popular Russian daily Komsomolskaya Pravda, who was arrested earlier this month after writing about an apartment shootout in Minsk that killed two people — an opposition supporter and an officer of the KGB, Belarus’ state security service. Mazheyka’s report about the shootings in Minsk quoted a friend describing the dead opposition supporter in a positive light. The journalist faces up to 12 years in prison on charges of inciting social strife and insulting authorities. Komsomolskaya Pravda responded to Mazheyka’s arrest by shutting down its branch in Belarus. Russian officials have voiced regret about the situation, but stopped short of criticizing authorities in Belarus, which has close political, economic and military ties with Russia. “In the center of Europe, the authorities here are staging a dark experiment, trying to deprive citizens of access to any independent information,” said Andrei Bastunets, the head of the Belarusian Association of Journalists. “The independent media in Belarus can still exist thanks to the internet, but the authorities have clearly taken North Korea as a model.”",western,1,372,98.06,43.22,25.64,3.96,23.25,34.68,78.49,52.96,43.28,4.57,1.88,0,0,0,0.54,1.08,2.69,15.86,9.95,2.69,17.2,3.23,2.69,5.65,0.27,6.99,5.11,4.03,8.6,0.81,0.27,7.53,7.8,0.27,7.26,1.08,1.08,0.81,1.34,0.27,2.69,0,3.23,0.54,2.69,0.54,0,0.54,0,0.27,0.27,0,8.33,4.3,0.27,0.27,2.15,0,2.69,3.49,0,0,0,0.54,4.57,1.88,2.15,0.54,5.38,0,0.81,4.3,0.27,0,1.34,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.54,0,0,0.81,0.81,0,0,0,0.27,0,3.49,8.87,0.27,0.54,7.26,0.81,0,0,4.3,4.3,1.34,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.52,4.3,5.38,0,0,1.88,2.96

Putin’s statement on Tuesday added to signs of easing tensions over a Russian military buildup near Ukraine and fears of a possible invasion. Hours earlier, Russia announced that some units participating in military exercises would begin returning to their bases. But U.S. President Joe Biden said the U.S. had not verified Russia’s claim and that an invasion was still a distinct possibility. He said the U.S. would give diplomacy “every chance” to prevent a Russian invasion, but he struck a skeptical tone about Moscow’s intentions. Much remains unclear about Russia’s plans and how the crisis will play out. Here’s a look at what is happening where and why: WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH RUSSIAN TROOPS? Russia’s Defense Ministry announced that some units participating in exercises would begin returning to their bases. But it wasn’t immediately clear where exactly these troops were deployed or how many were leaving. The announcement came a day after Western officials said some forces and military hardware were moving toward the Ukrainian border, muddying the picture. Russia denies it has any plans to invade Ukraine, despite placing troops on Ukraine’s borders to the north, south and east and holding major exercises. Biden said 150,000 Russian forces are now massed near Ukraine and in neighboring Belarus, an increase from an earlier U.S. estimate of 130,000 troops. HOW DO OTHERS SEE THAT? Speaking alongside Putin in Moscow, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said: “That we are now hearing that some troops are being withdrawn is in any case a good signal, and we hope that more will follow.” Scholz didn’t say whether Germany had any evidence a troop pullback was in fact happening. Ukraine’s leaders voiced skepticism, and others also were cautious. “Russia constantly makes various statements,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said. “That’s why we have the rule: We won’t believe when we hear, we’ll believe when we see. When we see troops pulling out, we’ll believe in de-escalation.” French government spokesman Gabriel Attal said France was trying to confirm the information about Russian troop movements and he would speak “carefully.” “But if confirmed, that’s obviously a good thing. That would be a sign of de-escalation, which we have been calling for for several weeks. That would also confirm that we were right to reinitiate dialogue,” Attal said. French President Emmanuel Macron met with Putin in Moscow last week and spoke with Biden on Tuesday. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that “so far, we have not seen any de-escalation on the ground, not seen any signs of reduced Russian military presence on the borders of Ukraine.” Stoltenberg said Russia has in the past moved into areas, like Belarus, with troops and equipment, then pulled back while leaving military material in place for rapid use later. He said that NATO wants to see a “significant and enduring withdrawal of forces, troops, and not least the heavy equipment.” However, Stoltenberg said there are “some grounds for cautious optimism” for diplomatic efforts given the signals coming from Moscow. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Russia was sending “mixed signals.” “We are seeing Russian openness to conversations,” Johnson said after a meeting of his government’s COBRA crisis committee. “On the other hand, the intelligence we are seeing today is still not encouraging.” He said Russia continued to build field hospitals in Belarus near the Ukrainian border, which “can only be construed as preparation for an invasion.” WHAT IS PUTIN SAYING? Putin noted after his talks with Germany’s Scholz that the U.S. and NATO rejected Moscow’s demand to keep Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations out of NATO, halt weapons deployments near Russian borders and to roll back alliance forces from Eastern Europe. But the U.S. and NATO agreed to discuss a range of security measures that Russia had previously proposed. Putin said Russia was ready to engage in talks on limiting the deployment of intermediate range missiles in Europe, transparency of drills and other confidence-building measures. But he reemphasized the need for the West to heed Russia’s main demands. WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING ON THE DIPLOMATIC FRONT? Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau of Poland, currently the chair of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, met Lavrov in Moscow. Rau said the OSCE has offered multilateral talks aimed at easing tensions. Ukraine’s foreign minister hosted his Italian counterpart. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said he conveyed to Zelenskyy during a phone call Japan’s strong support for diplomatic efforts and sanctions against Russia in case of aggression. WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE LATEST CYBERATTACKS? A series of cyberattacks on Tuesday knocked the websites of the Ukrainian army, the defense ministry and major banks offline, Ukrainian authorities said. Still, there was no indication the relatively low-level distributed-denial-of-service attacks might be a smokescreen for more serious and damaging cyber mischief. At least 10 Ukrainian websites were unreachable, including those of the Defense Ministry, the Foreign Ministry, the Culture Ministry and Ukraine’s two largest state banks. The Ukrainian Information Ministry’s Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security suggested Russia could be behind the attacks. But quick attribution in cyberattacks is typically difficult, as aggressors often try to hide their tracks. Ukraine has been subject to a steady diet of Russian aggression in cyberspace. WHAT DOES THE U.S. SENATE HAVE TO SAY? In a rare bipartisan accord, Senate leaders issued a joint statement Tuesday signaling solidarity with an independent Ukraine and issuing a stern warning that Russia would pay a “severe price” of sanctions if it invades. Senators of both parties have been eager to show a unified front from the U.S. But they shelved for now their own sanctions legislation, unable to resolve differences over the scope and timing and deferring to the White House strategy for edging Russia away from the crisis. “In this dark hour,” the 12 Democratic and Republican senators declared, they wanted to make sure the strong U.S. position was clear to the people of Ukraine and to Putin. WHAT DO RUSSIAN LAWMAKERS WANT? Russian lawmakers called on Putin to recognize rebel-held areas in eastern Ukraine, the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics, as independent states. The State Duma, Russia’s lower house of parliament, voted Tuesday to submit an appeal to Putin to that effect, put forward earlier by Russia’s Communist Party. Kyiv isn’t fulfilling the Minsk agreements, mediated by Germany and France in an effort to bring peace to eastern Ukraine, and “our citizens and compatriots that live in Donbas need help and support,” State Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin said on the Telegram messaging app. Volodin said the document will be submitted to Putin “immediately.” Putin said the motion reflects the Russian public’s concern about people living in eastern Ukraine. He noted, however, that Russia continues to believe that a 2015 peace deal brokered by France and Germany should serve as the main vehicle for resolving disputes over eastern Ukraine. Scholz said a process to shore up that agreement “should be supported by everyone and held up by no one.” “Of course, if the resolution the (Russian) parliament agreed to today became reality, that would mean flouting the Minsk agreement,” Scholz added. “I think all involved know that … then the process would be broken off and ended, and that would be a political catastrophe.” WHAT’S THE FEELING IN MOSCOW? While the U.S. has warned that Russia could invade Ukraine any day, the drumbeat of war is  all but unheard in Moscow, where pundits and ordinary people alike don’t expect Putin to attack Russia’s ex-Soviet neighbor. The Kremlin has cast the U.S. warnings of an imminent attack as “hysteria” and “absurdity,” and many Russians believe that Washington is deliberately stoking panic and fomenting tensions to trigger a conflict for domestic reasons. Putin’s angry rhetoric about NATO’s plans to expand to Russia’s “doorstep” and its refusal to hear Moscow’s concerns has struck a chord with the public, tapping into a sense of betrayal by the West after the end of the Cold War and widespread suspicion about Western designs. ___ Dasha Litvinova in Moscow, Yuras Karmanau in Kyiv, Ukraine, Sylvie Corbet in Paris, Lorne Cook in Brussels, Jill Lawless in London and Lolita C.

The Feb. 3-8 exercises were to be held 240 kilometers (150 miles) off southwestern Ireland — in international waters but within Ireland’s exclusive economic zone. Ireland is a member of the 27-nation European Union but not a member of NATO. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney this week objected to the war games, saying “This isn’t a time to increase military activity and tension in the context of what’s happening with and in Ukraine. The fact that they are choosing to do it on the western borders, if you like, of the EU, off the Irish coast, is something that in our view is simply not welcome.” Russia’s embassy in Ireland on Saturday posted a letter on Facebook from Ambassador Yuriy Filatov saying the exercises would be relocated outside of the Irish economic zone ”with the aim not to hinder fishing activities.” The decision was a rare concession amid the escalating tensions surrounding Russia’s massing of an estimated 100,000 troops near the border with Ukraine and its demands that NATO promise never to allow Ukraine to join the alliance, stop the deployment of NATO weapons near Russian borders and roll back its forces from Eastern Europe. The U.S. and NATO formally rejected those demands this week, although Washington outlined areas where discussions are possible, offering hope that there could be a way to avoid war. Russian President Vladimir Putin has made no public remarks about the Western response. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said it leaves little chance for reaching agreement, though he also says Russia does not want war. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Friday that Putin could use any portion of his force to seize Ukrainian cities and “significant territories” or to carry out “coercive acts or provocative political acts” like the recognition of breakaway territories inside Ukraine. Two territories in eastern Ukraine have been under the control of Russia-backed rebels since 2014, after Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine. A Russian lawmaker is encouraging residents of those areas of Ukraine to join the Russian army, a sign that Moscow is continuing to try to integrate those territories as much as possible. Viktor Vodolatsky said Saturday that residents in rebels-held areas in eastern Ukraine fear assaults by Ukrainian forces and that those who hold Russian passports would be welcomed in the Russian military. “If Russian citizens residing in the (territories) want to join the Russian Armed Forces, the Rostov regional military commissariat will register and draft them,” Vodolatsky, deputy chairman of parliament committee on relations with neighbors, told the state news agency Tass. Russia has granted passports to more than 500,000 people in the rebel-held territories. Vodolatsky said the recruits would serve in Russia — but that leaves open the option that they could join any future invasion force. A senior official in President Joe Biden’s administration said the U.S. welcomed Lavrov’s comments that Russia does not want war, “but this needs to be backed up with action. We need to see Russia pulling some of the troops that they have deployed away from the Ukrainian border and taking other de-escalatory steps.” The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk publicly. Lavrov has said the U.S. suggested the two sides could talk about limits on the deployment of intermediate-range missiles, restrictions on military drills and rules to prevent accidents between warships and aircraft. He said the Russians proposed discussing those issues years ago, but Washington and its allies never took them up on it. He also said those issues are secondary to Russia’s main concerns about NATO. He said international agreements say the security of one nation must not come at the expense of others, and said he would send letters to his Western counterparts asking them to explain their failure to respect that pledge. Washington has warned Moscow of devastating sanctions if it invades Ukraine, including penalties targeting top Russian officials and key economic sectors. Lavrov said Moscow had warned Washington that sanctions would amount to a complete severing of ties. NATO, meanwhile, said it was bolstering its deterrence in the Baltic Sea region. Russia has launched military drills involving motorized infantry and artillery units in southwestern Russia, warplanes in Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea, and dozens of warships in the Black Sea and the Arctic. Russian troops are also in Belarus for joint drills, raising Western fears that Moscow could stage an attack on Ukraine from the north from Belarus. The Ukrainian capital is only 75 kilometers (46 miles) from the border with Belarus.",western,1,794,91.6,44.53,23.32,11.29,25.61,29.72,79.35,56.55,44.46,7.43,2.52,0,0.25,0.13,1.01,1.01,4.91,13.6,7.93,1.64,15.62,5.92,2.14,5.04,1.39,12.59,4.28,2.64,9.45,2.52,0.38,6.42,9.19,0.38,8.69,0.63,1.39,2.27,1.76,0.25,3.27,0,3.65,1.39,2.27,0.5,0.13,0.38,0.38,0,0,0,11.71,6.8,0.63,0.38,0.76,0,3.9,5.04,0,0,0,1.01,7.68,5.42,2.27,0,2.02,0.13,0.38,1.01,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.38,0.5,0.25,0,0.13,0,0,0.63,0,2.64,12.22,0.25,1.26,10.2,0.38,0,0.38,2.02,3.53,2.9,0.76,0,0,0,0,0,12.72,4.91,3.4,0,0,1.01,3.4
760,apnews.com,2022-02-11 08:00:00,https://apnews.com/4d1e75eb68e1396bef885425c65039fb,UK defense secretary in Moscow amid Ukraine tensions,English,United States,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration on Friday escalated dire warnings of a possibly imminent Russian invasion of Ukraine, saying  it could happen at any moment,  even as emergency diplomatic efforts continued. U.S. officials said the United States is preparing to evacuate its embassy in Kyiv, and Americans in Ukraine are being told to leave within the next 48 hours. Adding to the sense of crisis, the Pentagon ordered an additional 3,000 U.S. troops to Poland to reassure allies. As diplomatic options for averting war in Ukraine appeared to narrow, the White House said President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin would discuss the crisis by phone on Saturday. Biden has said the U.S. military will not enter a war in Ukraine, but he has promised severe economic sanctions against Moscow, in concert with international allies. Timing of possible Russian military action remains a key question. The U.S. picked up intelligence that Russia is looking at Wednesday as a target date, according to a U.S. official familiar with the findings. The official, who was not authorized to speak publicly and did so only on condition of anonymity, would not say how definitive the intelligence was, and the White House publicly underscored that the U.S. does not know with certainty whether Putin is committed to invasion. However, U.S. officials said anew that Russia’s buildup of offensive air, land and sea firepower near Ukraine has reached the point where it could invade on short notice. U.S. officials told The Associated Press late Friday that the State Department plans to announce early Saturday that virtually all American staff at the Kyiv embassy will be required to leave. The State Department would not comment. The department had earlier ordered families of U.S. embassy staffers in Kyiv to leave. But it had left it to the discretion of nonessential personnel if they wanted to depart. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, said a small number of officials may remain in Kyiv but the vast majority of the almost 200 Americans will be sent out or relocated to Ukraine’s far west, near the Polish border, so the U.S. can retain a diplomatic presence in the country. Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, urged all Americans in Ukraine to leave, emphasizing that they should not expect the U.S. military to rescue them in the event that air and rail transportation is severed after a Russian invasion. Several NATO allies including Britain, Canada, Norway and Denmark also are asking their citizens to leave Ukraine, as is non-NATO ally New Zealand. Sullivan said Russian military action could start with missile and air attacks, followed by a ground offensive. “Yes, it is an urgent message because we are in an urgent situation,” he told reporters at the White House. “Russia has all the forces it needs to conduct a major military action,” Sullivan said, adding, “Russia could choose, in very short order, to commence a major military action against Ukraine.” He said the scale of such an invasion could range from a limited incursion to a strike on Kyiv, the capital. Russia scoffed at the U.S. talk of urgency. “The hysteria of the White House is more indicative than ever,” said Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova. “The Anglo-Saxons need a war. At any cost. Provocations, misinformation and threats are a favorite method of solving their own problems.” In addition to the more than 100,000 ground troops that U.S. officials say Russia has assembled along Ukraine’s eastern and southern borders, the Russians have deployed missile, air, naval and special operations forces, as well as supplies to sustain a war. This week Russia moved six amphibious assault ships into the Black Sea, augmenting its capability to land marines on the coast. Sullivan’s stark warning accelerated the projected timeframe for a potential invasion, which many analysts have believed was unlikely until after the Winter Olympics in China end  on Feb. 20. Sullivan said the combination of a further Russian troop buildup on Ukraine’s borders and unspecified intelligence indicators have prompted the administration to warn that war could begin any time. “We can’t pinpoint the day at this point, and we can’t pinpoint the hour, but that is a very, very distinct possibility,” Sullivan said. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin conferred by phone with several of his NATO counterparts. Echoing Sullivan’s public remarks, Austin told them a Russian invasion of Ukraine “could begin at any time,” Kirby said. Biden has said U.S. troops will not enter Ukraine to contest any Russian invasion, but he has bolstered the U.S. military presence in Europe as reassurance to allies on NATO’s eastern flank. On Friday the Pentagon said Biden ordered a further 3,000 soldiers to Poland, on top of 1,700 who are on their way there. Together they form an infantry brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division. The U.S. Army also is shifting 1,000 soldiers from Germany to Romania, which like Poland shares a border with Ukraine. Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke by phone Friday with his Russian counterpart, Gen. Valery Gerasimov. Milley’s office provided no details beyond saying the two men discussed “several security-related issues of concern.” Milley also had phone calls with several of his counterparts from NATO countries, including Canada, France, Germany, Britain, Italy, Poland and Romania. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who was traveling in Australia, was the first senior U.S. official to say publicly that an invasion could come before the end of the Olympics. Sullivan would not discuss the intelligence details behind the U.S. assessment and denied a report that American officials believe Putin has made the decision to invade. But he said U.S. officials believe there is “a strong possibility” of an invasion. “We believe he very well may give the final go order,” Sullivan said. “It may well happen soon.” Biden spoke to a number of European leaders on Friday to underscore the concerns raised by U.S. intelligence about the potential imminence of a Russian invasion. Sullivan said the Western leaders were completely united and would respond harshly to a Russian invasion with devastating economic and trade sanctions. Britain’s defense secretary, Ben Wallace, visited Moscow a day after British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss held frosty talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and urged him to pull back Russia’s troops near Ukraine. Lavrov characterized that meeting as a “conversation between deaf and dumb.” Russia opened massive war games in Belarus on Thursday that are due to run through next weekend but says it has no plans to invade Ukraine. The Russians are insisting that the West keep Ukraine and other former Soviet countries out of NATO. It also wants NATO to refrain from deploying weapons near its border and to roll back alliance forces from Eastern Europe — demands flatly rejected by the West. Speaking at the start of his talks with Britain’s Wallace, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said “the military-political situation in Europe is growing increasingly tense, and it’s not our fault.” Shoigu said shipments of weapons to Ukraine by the U.S., Britain and other allies have contributed to the tensions and pointed to the recent deployment of British soldiers to Ukraine, asking why they were sent and how long they would stay. Speaking to reporters after the talks, Wallace said the anti-tank missiles that Britain sent to Ukraine were defensive tactical weapons that do not pose a threat to any neighbor unless it invades. He described the talks as “constructive and frank” and noted his Russian counterpart’s assurances that Moscow has no intention to attack Ukraine. But he also emphasized that the concentration of Russian troops near Ukrainian territory is clearly “beyond normal exercising.” Russia’s troop concentration includes forces deployed on the territory of its ally Belarus for massive joint drills involving firing live ammunition. Those exercises entered a decisive phase Thursday and will run through Feb. 20. The Ukrainian capital is about 75 kilometers (47 miles) south of the Belarus border. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg visited a military base in Romania, hailing the deployment of additional U.S. troops as “a powerful demonstration of trans-Atlantic unity.” Separately, the U.S. Agency for International Development notified Congress on Friday of a new $73 million aid package to Georgia, another former Soviet republic that has faced aggression from Moscow and fought a war with Russia in 2008. The assistance includes almost $46 million in money to help Georgia combat “transnational threats and crime,” notably to “decrease dependence on Russia,” according to the congressional notification that was obtained by the AP. Russia and Ukraine have been locked in a bitter conflict since 2014, when Ukraine’s Kremlin-friendly leader was driven from office by a popular uprising. Moscow responded by annexing Crimea and then backing a separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine, where fighting has killed over 14,000 people.

The White House in recent weeks publicized what it said was a developing Russian “false-flag” operation to create pretext for an invasion. Britain named specific Ukrainians it accused of having ties to Russian intelligence officers plotting to overthrow President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The U.S. also released a map of Russian military positions and detailed how officials believe Russia will try to attack Ukraine with as many as 175,000 troops. Experts credit the White House for declassifying intelligence and moving to rebut false claims before they’re made — a so-called “prebuttal” that undercuts their effectiveness better than an after-the-fact explanation. But the release of information isn’t without risks. Intelligence assessments carry varying degrees of certainty, and beyond offering photos of troop movements, the U.S. and its allies have provided little other proof. Moscow has dismissed Washington’s claims as hysteria and invoked past American intelligence failures, including false information put forward about Iraq’s weapons programs. There are no clear signs of change so far from Russia, which continues to move forces toward Ukraine and into Belarus, an ally to Ukraine’s north. There is growing pessimism in Washington and London about ongoing diplomatic efforts and a belief that Putin will likely mount some sort of invasion in the next several weeks. Russia is known for using disinformation as a tactic to sow confusion and discord as part of its overall conflict strategy. When Russia invaded Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014, it mounted a campaign to sway ethnic Russian residents of the territory. State media and social media accounts linked to Russia promoted allegations that the West was manipulating protests in Kyiv and false or unconfirmed tales of lurid crimes committed by Ukrainian forces. This time, the U.S. and allies say, Russia is trying to portray Ukrainian leaders as aggressors and to persuade its own citizens to support military action. At the same time, the U.S. and its allies allege, Russia has positioned operatives in eastern Ukraine who could use explosives to carry out acts of sabotage against Russia’s own proxy forces and then blame Kyiv. The White House has repeatedly highlighted what it sees as disinformation and is privately sharing additional intelligence with allies including Ukraine. The State Department recently published a fact sheet listing and rejecting several Russian claims. And the Treasury Department sanctioned  four men accused of ties to influence operations intended to set the pretext in Ukraine for a new invasion. White House press secretary Jen Psaki described a “strategic decision to call out disinformation when we see it.” “We are much more cognizant of the Russian disinformation machine than we were in 2014,” she said Wednesday, adding, “We need to be very clear with the global community and the U.S. public what they’re trying to do and why.” A European Union official told reporters Friday that Moscow-aligned outlets are promoting justifications for conflict in a similar manner to eight years ago. One narrative those outlets are promoting — in apparent response to the recent American allegations — is the U.S. may be planning its own false-flag operation to trigger a confrontation in eastern Ukraine. Moscow continues to make demands that NATO not accept Ukraine or further expand to any other countries. And after British intelligence accused him of being a possible Russia-backed candidate for president, Ukrainian politician Yevheniy Murayev denied the claim and told the AP that it “looks ridiculous and funny.” Meanwhile, Washington and Moscow go back and forth online. Kremlin-backed RT.com on Dec. 21 posted a video alleging “US private military companies are amassing CHEMICAL COMPONENTS in Eastern Ukraine.” The State Department rejected that claim in its fact sheet on Russian propaganda. Russia’s Foreign Ministry then responded with tweets “debunking @StateDept ‘facts’ on Russian disinformation on Ukraine.” Washington’s efforts have raised questions in Kyiv, where Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has taken a different public approach of trying to tamp down public fears of an expanded war even as many Ukrainians prepare for possible combat. Ukrainian officials privately question why the Biden administration is warning about an impending invasion but not imposing preemptive sanctions or taking action against the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which has been criticized for giving Moscow more leverage over Ukraine and Western Europe. The Biden administration lobbied Democrats in Congress to oppose a Republican-sponsored bill that would have required the imposition of sanctions against the pipeline, which has not yet gone into operation. The White House has threatened tough sanctions if Russia does invade and is preparing to move forces to NATO’s eastern flank in the event of an invasion. The U.S. and Western allies are also sending weapons and missile systems to Ukraine. Molly McKew, a writer and lecturer on Russian influence, said the administration’s moves to counter Russia’s influence efforts needed to be accompanied by a clearer statement of American goals and plans to repel any invasion. Publicly identifying Russia’s actions alone will not stop Russia from carrying them out, said McKew, a former adviser to President Mikhail Saakashvili of Georgia, which fought a war in 2008 with Russia and still is trying to regain control of separatist regions backed by Moscow. “They’re trying to apply disinformation thinking to military domains,” she said. “You absolutely cannot expose away the crisis.” In both the U.S. and Ukraine, experts say, there is far more societal awareness now of state-sponsored disinformation. Russia in the past several years has continued to bombard Ukrainians with text messages and false stories during the ongoing war in eastern Ukraine in which at least 14,000 people have died. And Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election led to several investigations and years of often fractious debates. Bret Schafer, senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund’s Alliance for Securing Democracy, said that while there are risks to elevating false claims in the process of debunking them, “there is a need to head off information threats as opposed to responding to them after they’ve been let out into the wild.” But publicly accusing Russia of misbehavior is ultimately a limited deterrent. “They don’t care about reputational damage,” he said. ___ Associated Press journalists Joshua Boak in Washington, Lorne Cook in Brussels, and Jan M.

Lukashenko made the pledge during a visit to a facility that accommodates migrants at the border. “My task is to help you, people in trouble,” Lukashenko said, addressing thousands of migrants during a visit to a facility accommodating migrants at the Bruzgi warehouse. “We, Belarusians, including myself, will do everything as you wish, even if it is bad for Poles, Latvians and someone else.” “We will work together with you on your dream,” Lukashenko added. Lukashenko’s visit comes after weeks of tensions at the border, where hundreds of people remain stuck. Since Nov. 8, a large group of people, mostly from the Middle East, has been stranded in Belarus at a border crossing with Poland, trapped as forces from the two countries face off against each other. Most are fleeing conflict or a sense of hopelessness at home, and aim to reach Germany or other Western European countries. Lukashenko again called on Germany to accept migrants. German government spokesman Steffen Seibert on Friday strongly denied claims by Lukashenko that Germany had agreed to take in 2,000 migrants currently in Belarus. “It’s not true that Germany agrees to this,” he told reporters in Berlin. Videos and photographs taken by local media outlets show the authoritarian leader of Belarus surveying conditions at the migrants’ crowded quarters. Russia’s state RIA Novosti news agency reported that crowds of migrants applauded Lukashenko on his arrival. Lukashenko said that apart from about 2,000 people at the border facility, another 2,000 to 3,000 more migrants currently remain in Belarus. He promised migrants that the Belarusian authorities would help them return to their home countries — but only if they want to. “In no case will we detain you, tie your hands, load you on airplanes and send you home if you don’t want that,” Lukashenko said. Lukashenko said that about 200 migrants still manage to illegally enter the EU every day. Over 170 people returned to Iraq’s northern Kurdish-run region on Friday with another return flight expected later in the day. Last week, 430 Iraqis returned home after a failed attempt to reach the European Union. The West has accused Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko of luring thousands of migrants to Belarus with the promise of help to get to Western Europe to use them as pawns to destabilize the 27-nation European Union in retaliation for its sanctions on his authoritarian government.

Moscow, Washington, London, Paris, Berlin, Vienna. Sometimes Kyiv. But only sometimes. These Ukrainians are far from the Russian ships headed to a naval exercise off the coast of Ireland, from the American-built fighter jets streaming to the Baltics and from the U.S. aircraft carrier steadily sailing the Mediterranean. As Western-supplied weapons land by the planeload in Kyiv, soldiers and civilians alike wait here with helpless anticipation for  decisions made by people who know little about the lives of those on the eastern front lines — a battle-weary region near where Russia has massed tens of thousands of soldiers in a troop buildup that U.S. President Joe Biden said could mount the largest invasion since World War II. The soldiers in Zolote 4 have been defending against Russian encroachment for years. They are just a few hundred meters from pro-Russia separatist fighters, who are on the other side of a checkpoint that no one can safely cross. The soldiers assume that’s where the snipers are, though they’ve never seen any gunmen. After three days with no shooting, “all of a sudden they opened up with grenade launchers and firearms. One mortar shell flew over and fell in the field behind us. Two more hit between ours and the next position. In 15 minutes, everything was quiet again. Why? What for? Nobody knows. And that’s how it is around here,” said Oleh Surhov, a Ukrainian soldier who fled Crimea in 2014 after the Russians seized the peninsula. He joined the fight soon after he evacuated his wife, children and grandchildren to western Ukraine. Zolote 1 through 5 got their names decades ago during the Soviet era — the name means “Golden” — when they were labeled as units of the local coal mining operation. Now 1 through 4 are in Ukraine and 5 sits less than a kilometer (half-mile) away, across the checkpoint. The sense of waiting for someone else’s decisions has also infected the nearby village of Katerynivka, which bears the scars of eight years of shelling. It has newer trenches, which are heated by rough wood stoves whose warmth draws nearly as many dogs and cats as soldiers. The luckiest trench cats get taken back by soldiers when they rotate off the front. “We joke that hope is the last thing to die. All of us are waiting for peace. Neither our children nor grandkids can visit us,” said Liubov, a local woman who wouldn’t give her last name. “We talk on the phone and that’s enough. Let’s wait until peace comes!” If war comes instead, it is as likely as not to strike first in eastern Ukraine, where the pro-Russia separatists have been in control since 2014. In Russia, across the border, more than 100,000 troops are gathering, and thousands more are going into position for what Russia says are military exercises on Ukraine’s border to the north with Belarus. Moscow denies it is planning an assault, but the United States and  its NATO allies are preparing for a possible war, bolstering their presence in the Baltics and putting 8,500 American troops on higher alert for potential deployment to Europe. Britain and the U.S. have sent multiple planeloads of weapons to Ukraine. Ukrainian officials have accepted the help but found themselves on the sidelines of several rounds of high-stakes diplomacy that so far have not yielded a breakthrough. “Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said early this month after one such meeting. But Ukraine’s president was left to fume on Twitter last week when Biden mused aloud about how to respond to a “minor incursion.” “We want to remind the great powers that there are no minor incursions and small nations. Just as there are no minor casualties and little grief from the loss of loved ones,” President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote. On Monday, the White House summoned European leaders, including NATO’s secretary-general, to a videoconference about Ukraine to discuss U.S. ideas on how to respond to Russia’s demands. “We have shared those ideas with our European allies and partners. We are taking their feedback. We are incorporating that feedback into the written response,” U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said. Ukraine wasn’t invited to the videoconference, but American officials said their feedback was also key. Ukrainian and Russian representatives met Wednesday in Paris to discuss the prospects for a stalled 2015 peace deal brokered by France and Germany to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The meeting went longer than expected and ended with agreement to meet again — in Berlin. If Ukraine sometimes seems to be an afterthought for the powerful countries deciding its fate, the country’s east is even farther from the centers of power. In Vesele, a separatist area in the eastern Donetsk region, little has changed since the fighting in 2014. Signs still warn about minefields. Concrete block buildings have only crumbled further in the years since they were shelled, and no one has come to tow away the cars hastily abandoned under gunfire. “There is practically no one here, because everything is broken. There is light, gas, water supply, but there is no life,” said Vladimir, a local man who refused to give his last name. He estimated Ukrainian troops were about a kilometer (half-mile) away, and he wanted them gone so people could decide their own fates. “If they would completely leave and liberate” the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, “then we could decide. I think nobody wants (to be a part of) Ukraine here,” he said. But he, like most in the east, believed those decisions were in someone else’s hands. ___ Hinnant reported from Paris.",western,1,962,82.85,64.62,74.37,13.54,17.49,23.91,84.1,63.51,50,8.32,4.68,0.1,1.46,0,0.94,1.56,3.64,14.55,8,2.29,16.11,6.34,5.09,6.65,1.77,13.31,6.65,4.47,6.65,3.12,0.1,3.43,11.75,1.87,9.77,2.81,1.56,1.14,1.87,0.1,3.01,0.1,3.85,1.56,2.18,0.52,0.21,0.21,0,0,0.1,0,12.16,4.78,0.52,0,0.83,0,2.6,7.59,0.73,0,0.31,1.14,3.64,1.98,1.35,0.31,2.91,0.1,0.21,2.49,0.21,0,0.52,0.1,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0.21,0,0.42,0.62,0,0.21,0,0,0.62,0.21,3.64,13.51,0.42,1.77,10.81,0.42,0.21,0.42,5.3,4.26,5.09,1.46,0,0,0,0,0,17.88,6.65,5.3,0.21,0.1,1.46,4.16

The dramatic developments put a spotlight on Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko’s iron-fisted rule and suppression of dissent — but it was not clear what effect more sanctions or other measures would have. “Additional sanctions? Will this be sufficient? I absolutely can’t say today,” said French President Emmanuel Macron. But, he added: ”The unacceptable character of what happened … justifies them.” After his detention, opposition journalist Raman Pratasevich was seen in a brief video clip on Belarusian state television late Monday, speaking rapidly to say that he was confessing to some of the charges authorities have leveled against him. The spokesperson for the U.N.’s human rights office, Rupert Colville, said Pratasevich’s appearance likely was not voluntary and that he seemed to have bruising to his face, although it was difficult to tell from the video. Asked about the video, German Chancellor Angela Merkel agreed with Britain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson that it was “worrying and disturbing” and makes the EU demand for his release “all the more urgent.” “And we will use all channels at our disposal to do this,” she added. The 26-year-old journalist and activist was arrested Sunday after Belarusian flight controllers ordered the Ryanair jetliner he was aboard to land, telling the crew that there was a bomb threat against the flight. A Belarusian fighter jet was scrambled to escort the plane to Minsk, just before it was to land in Vilnius, Lithuania, from Athens, Greece. In an unusually swift response to the arrest and flight diversion, EU leaders agreed Monday to ban Belarusian airlines from using the airspace and airports of the 27-nation bloc and impose sanctions on officials linked to the diversion. “The measures of restricting flights in particular … are extremely biting on the Belarus system,” Macron said. The EU demanded Pratasevich’s release and urged the International Civil Aviation Organization to investigate the diversion, while recommending European carriers avoid Belarus’ airspace. Polish carrier LOT and Baltic airlines began bypassing the country, while Air France, KLM, Lufthansa and others said they will follow suit. Belarus has defended its actions. Its Transport Ministry said Tuesday it has invited international aviation, U.S. and EU authorities to investigate the diversion. In the wake of the brazen move, Belarus’ first post-Soviet leader, Stanislav Shushkevich, urged the West to introduce even tougher sanctions. “Belarus has become a ‘black hole’ of Europe with repressions reaching a catastrophic scale and its dictator scrambling fighter jets and threatening the entire world,” Shushkevich told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. “The West must understand that only increasing pressure and really tough sanctions could impact Lukashenko and limit repressions.” EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc will introduce more sanctions targeting “businesses and economic entities that are financing this regime.” Added Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte: “We know that in this country, the major state companies make the money. This is going to hit them and everything is targeted towards making them feel the sting.”. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Lukashenko’s action “is hard to beat in terms of perfidy.” “The lives of more than 170 passengers were endangered here to arrest a journalist. It’s a threefold attack -- an attack on the safety of air traffic, on press freedom and the European citizens on board,” he said. Lukashenko has faced unprecedented pressure at home with months of protests triggered by his reelection to a sixth term in an August 2020 vote that the opposition rejected as rigged. But he has only doubled down on repression, and more than 35,000 people have been arrested since the protests began, with thousands beaten. Some say more sanctions will do little to alleviate the situation and will only push Belarus even closer to its main sponsor and ally, Russia, and reduce the influence of the EU and others. “Lukashenko will become an increasingly easy prey for the Kremlin,” said Alexander Klaskouski, an independent Minsk-based political analyst. “As a pariah country, Belarus will find it much more difficult to fend off the Kremlin demands for the introduction of a single currency, the deployment of air bases and access to lucrative Belarusian economic assets.” Even as the West condemned Belarus, the crackdown continued Tuesday. Pavel Seviarynets, the leader of the opposition Christian-Democratic Party, was sentenced to seven years in prison on charges of organizing mass riots. “Most leaders of Belarus’ political parties have been either jailed or forced to flee the country,” said Ales Bialiatski, head of the Viasna human rights center. “Belarus is facing an acute human rights crisis ... amid unprecedented political repressions.” Pratasevich, who left Belarus in 2019, has become a top foe of Lukashenko with a popular messaging app he ran playing a key role in helping organize the huge protests, and authorities have increasingly tried to limit his influence. The Telegram app’s Nexta channel that he co-founded has been labeled “extremist” by Belarusian authorities. Stsiapan Putsila, another co-founder of Nexta, told AP that he and his colleagues have received “thousands of threats” in the past to blow up their office in Warsaw. Pratasevich had been charged in absentia with staging mass riots and fanning social hatred. Those carry a prison sentence of up to 15 years, and some fear Pratasevich could face more serious charges, including some that carry the death penalty. Colville, the U.N. human rights official, said Pratasevich’s appearance on Belarus state TV “was not reassuring, given the apparent bruising to his face, and the strong likelihood that his appearance was not voluntary and his ‘confession’ to serious crimes was forced.” Pratasevich’s 23-year-old Russian girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, who also was removed from the flight and detained, spoke in a video from custody shown on state TV. In it, she said she had been working as the editor of a Telegram channel that revealed personal data about Belarus’ security officers amid the protests. Her lawyers had said earlier in the day that she has been jailed for two months, pending an investigation. The main opposition candidate in the last election, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who left the country immediately after the vote under official pressure, said she urged the U.S. to move to suspend Belarus’ membership in the ICAO and Interpol. Tsikhanouskaya also pushed for the G-7 to invite a Belarusian opposition delegation to its summit in London next month and thanked Macron for supporting her bid. But Max Blain, a spokesman for the British prime minister, said “the invite list for G-7 is already set” and wasn’t aware of any request from Macron to invite the opposition. The France-based media watchdog group Reporters Without Borders filed a complaint with the prosecutor general’s office in Vilnius against Lukashenko “and any other persons the investigation would identify as liable for instigating or committing the crime.“ It noted that under Lithuanian law, the use of force against a civilian aircraft to force it to change its route “under the false pretext of a bomb threat” constitutes the crime of hijacking. ___ Karmanau reported from Kyiv, Ukraine.

Successive Conservative governments have pledged to introduce legislation making it compulsory to name those owning property via foreign companies in a bid to stamp out money-laundering. Among the revelations: The BBC worked with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), the Guardian, Finance Uncovered and other media outlets to identify in the leaked files the individuals behind overseas companies that owned property in England and Wales. Owning real estate through an offshore firm is legal, and there is no suggestion of wrongdoing in simply using a foreign company to purchase property. However, the UK government recently raised its own assessment of the money laundering risk for the property market from ""medium"" to ""high"". The greatest level of risk is where there are ""difficulties in determining the ultimate beneficial owners"", according to a Home Office report in December 2020. It comes as a number of world leaders - including the King of Jordan and the ruling family of Azerbaijan - have featured in the Pandora Papers leak after buying property in the UK using offshore companies. The wife of retail tycoon Sir Philip Green purchased multi-million-pound prime London real estate as BHS, the department store chain they had owned, headed for collapse. Her identity as the buyer of properties in London was hidden because they were bought through anonymous companies based in the British Virgin Islands, a tax haven. The purchases included a £15m apartment in Mayfair and a new home for their daughter near Buckingham Palace, bought for £10.6m in 2016. The buying spree took place in the months after the Greens sold BHS for a token sum to a one-time bankrupt who had no retail experience. The chain collapsed, leading to the loss of 11,000 jobs and vacant sites in town centres. The downfall also led to an outcry when it emerged the business had left a black hole of up to £571m in its pension fund. Through their lawyers, both Sir Philip and Lady Green declined to answer detailed questions, suggesting that these were private matters. The Pandora Papers leak also reveals the property portfolio of the Qatari ruling family owned through another cross-border network of companies. The royal Al-Thani family purchased two properties on one of the world's most expensive terraces, overlooking Regent's Park in London. They were bought through offshore companies, saving millions of pounds in tax. BBC analysis found numerous other properties owned by members of the family through these structures, estimated to be worth over £650m. The Qatari government did not respond to questions about the BBC's findings. Gennadiy Bogolyubov is a Ukrainian billionaire who is under investigation by the FBI for money laundering. He and his business partner are accused of defrauding the bank they founded of more than £1bn. Court documents included in the Pandora Papers reveal him to be the ultimate owner of a collection of UK properties likely to be worth over £400m, including a building on Trafalgar Square. They are held via a network of companies, some offshore, that hide the identity of the owners. Mr Bogolyubov is the co-founder of PrivatBank, Ukraine's largest lender. The bank was nationalised in 2016 after regulators found a $5.5bn hole in its balance sheets. PrivatBank has been pursuing Mr Bogolyubov and his business partner Igor Kolomoisky through court action in England and the US, trying to reclaim more than $3bn relating to the money lost during their leadership. In 2020 the US Department of Justice sought to seize commercial properties in Texas, Ohio and Kentucky from the pair, suspecting that they were ""acquired using funds misappropriated from Privatbank"". The court cases are ongoing. Mr Bogolyubov's assets are currently subject to a worldwide freeze, secured in court by PrivatBank in 2017. In 2016 he decided to leave the country and settle in Switzerland, partly for ""tax reasons"". Lawyers for Mr Bogolyubov declined to comment as legal action is ongoing. Mikhail Gutseriev is a Russian oligarch who was sanctioned by the UK in August for his close relationship with Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko.  The Pandora Papers reveal that his son owns a multi-million pound office block through a secret offshore company, purchased for more than £40m. Mr Gutseriev is the founder of Safmar Group, a Russian conglomerate with interests in oil, coal, property and retail. Following the crackdown on human rights and democracy in Belarus in 2020, the UK and EU have recently brought in sanctions against President Lukashenko, along with Mr Gutseriev and other close associates. The British government has accused the Belarusian regime of continuing to ""crush democracy and violate human rights"". It described Mr Gutseriev as ""a prominent Russian businessman who is one of the main private investors in Belarus and a longstanding associate of Alexander Lukashenko"". It added that he had ""provided support for the government of Belarus, including through use of his business interests"". Mr Gutseriev is no longer involved in Safmar, which is now part-owned by his son, Said, a British citizen. Said Gutseriev's representatives told the BBC he did not have ""any business links with his father"".His lavish wedding made headlines in 2016 - it featured performances by Jennifer Lopez and Enrique Iglesias and was reported to have cost $1bn. Plans for a register of foreign companies owning UK property were first announced in 2016 by then Prime Minister David Cameron, so that ""corrupt individuals and countries will no longer be able to move, launder and hide illicit funds through London's property market, and will not benefit from our public funds"". Draft legislation was published two years later and ""progress"" on changing the law was promised in the 2019 Queen's Speech. Earlier this year, following the G7 summit, the government reiterated its commitment to create a public register of overseas entities who own UK real estate. However, the law has still not been introduced to Parliament and was not listed as one of the government's legislative priorities at this year's Queen's Speech. Labour MP Margaret Hodge told the BBC that when in government David Cameron and his Chancellor George Osborne ""promised us that they would create a public register of beneficial ownership here in the UK... but we've been waiting since 2016 for that promise to be enacted"". She added: ""It's ready, it's sitting there, it's not complicated... but it has yet to emerge... so it's a scandal that that's not happened."" The government says it is cracking down on money laundering with tougher laws and enforcement, and that it will introduce a register of offshore companies owning UK property when parliamentary time allows. The UK property holdings of the King of Jordan and the ruling family of Azerbaijan were exposed by BBC Panorama on Sunday. Lawyers for King Abdullah said he used his personal wealth to buy the homes and there was nothing improper about him using offshore firms to do so. Other revelations from the Pandora Papers highlight further links between foreign leaders and offshore ownership of UK property. The family of Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta, which has dominated the country's politics since independence, secretly owned offshore companies for decades. One of these firms bought an apartment in central London, according to Land Registry records. The company was set up by Ngina Kenyatta, the president's mother, and her two daughters Kristina and Anna. In 2018, Mr Kenyatta told the BBC Hardtalk programme that his family's wealth was known to the public, and as president he had declared his assets as required by law. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky participated in a network of offshore companies, co-owned with his long-time friends and TV business partners, the Guardian revealed on Sunday. These firms held assets including apartments near London's Regent's Park. A number of world leaders have released statements denying wrongdoing after featuring in the leak. Closer to home, major political donors to the Conservatives have invested in properties through offshore companies. Mohammed Amersi, bought two properties using offshore companies: a Mayfair townhouse and a country home in Gloucestershire. He was revealed by Panorama to have been involved in one of Europe's biggest corruption scandals. He denies any wrongdoing. Lubov Chernukhin has given more than £1.8m to the party since 2012. The Pandora Papers leak revealed the scale of the secret offshore wealth she shares with her husband, a former Russian minister. It includes a house near Regent's Park in London now worth about £38m, and a mansion in Oxfordshire bought for £10m. The properties were secretly acquired through a network of offshore companies. Mrs Chernukhin's lawyers say she is a British citizen and is entitled to do as she wishes with her money Russian businessman Victor Fedotov's companies have given £900,000 to MPs. He purchased a Hampshire manor house through a network of offshore companies. Files in the Pandora Papers suggest he made millions from a project that became mired in allegations of corruption. Mr Fedotov's lawyers said ""there is no evidence whatsoever"" he behaved improperly. The BBC searched for information about donors to all of the political parties among the Pandora Papers documents but the stories that emerged from the files were about Conservative donors. The Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents and files exposing the secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires. The data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington DC and has led to one of the biggest ever global investigations. More than 600 journalists from 117 countries have looked at the hidden fortunes of some of the most powerful people on the planet. BBC Panorama and the Guardian have led the investigation in the UK.

In awarding the Sakharov Prize to Navalny, the European Parliament praised his “immense personal bravery.” The 45-year-old activist fell ill from a nerve agent poisoning last year and recuperated in Germany, then was promptly arrested upon his return to Moscow and later imprisoned. “He has campaigned consistently against the corruption of Vladimir Putin’s regime, and through his social media accounts and political campaigns, Navalny has helped expose abuses and mobilize the support of millions of people across Russia. For this, he was poisoned and thrown in jail,” parliament President David Sassoli in a statement. Sassoli called for the immediate release of Navalny, who is Putin’s biggest domestic foe. There was no immediate reaction to the award from the Kremlin, which denies any involvement in Navalny’s poisoning. Following his imprisonment, authorities unleashed a sweeping crackdown on his groups and associates. In June, a court outlawed Navalny’s Foundation for Fighting Corruption and a network of his regional offices as extremist organizations, a verdict that carries long prison terms for those associated with it. Several top allies have fled Russia, and courts have given suspended sentences and restricted travel to some others who remained. An Interior Ministry wanted notice said Wednesday it is searching for Lyubov Sobol, a top Navalny associate who received a suspended sentence and faced travel restrictions. Her whereabouts are unknown, but Russian news reports suggested she has left the country. The EU recognition of Navalny will further sour relations between the 27-nation bloc and Russia. These ties have been on the decline for years, especially following Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula and its support for a separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine. The impact reverberated beyond the EU as well. Days after Russia suspended its mission at NATO and ordered the closure of the alliance’s office in Moscow in retaliation for NATO’s expulsion of Russian diplomats, the organization’s chief said he embraced the news. “I welcome the fact that a strong voice ... in Russia has been awarded this prize,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said, adding that the prize also was a call for “his unconditional release from prison” and to have an international investigation into it. Stoltenberg recalled that NATO considered the treatment of Navalny as part of a “pattern where we see that Russia has become more oppressive at home and more aggressive abroad.” Russia’s treatment of Navalny has only exacerbated matters. The EU has called for his immediate and unconditional release in what it sees as a politically motivated imprisonment and has said it holds Moscow responsible for his health. The EU imposed sanctions last year on six senior Russian officials for their alleged involvement in the poisoning of Navalny. Amid the standoff between Brussels and Moscow, the move by European lawmakers to award Navalny the prize has returned the issue to the heart of the political debate. “It is an important signal, also to the Kremlin, that the EU will not give in to pressure and blackmail or be fooled by empty promises,” said Sergey Lagodinsky, a Greens/EFA MEP from Germany. Navalny’s top associate Leonid Volkov said the prize showed that hundreds of lawmakers from different countries and parties agree the fight against corruption is an issue for all of Europe and that Navalny is “political prisoner No. 1 in the world and Putin’s personal captive.” “Europe understands that we are fighting to make Russia a normal European country, which it will become, and supports it,” he said in a post on Facebook. Ruslan Shaveddinov, another member of Navalny’s team, told The Associated Press that “Russian authorities may want this to be forgotten as soon as possible, but we see that European politicians believe that this issue is important and send quite a clear message that no one forgot and that they demand Alexei Navalny’s release.” He said Navalny’s associates will do everything possible to win his freedom, and will continue their anti-corruption investigations, political and public campaigns and protests. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borell tweeted the prize is a recognition of Navalny’s “commitment to defending democracy in Russia, at great personal cost.” Awarding the prize to Navalny “will keep his name in the news,” which is a priority for his supporters, said Ben Noble, associate professor of Russian politics at University College London. It’s unlikely to improve his conditions in prison or help his position “as it currently stands,” added Noble, co-author of “Navalny: Putin’s Nemesis, Russia’s Future?” He told AP that one worrying implication is that the award “could have a negative effect — that this adds to Moscow’s narrative of foreign interference, of what they claim is a concerted Western attempt to interfere in the country’s domestic affairs.” The 50,000-euro ($58,200) prize will be presented at the Dec. 15 session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. Other candidates had included a group of Afghan women, and imprisoned Bolivian politician and former interim President Jeanine Anez. The fate of Afghan women has taken center stage since the Taliban took power in the wake of the U.S. military departure from the country in August. Despite initial promises to protect the rights of women, the Taliban have come under criticism, including from the U.N., for not sticking to those commitments. The EU award, named for Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov, was created in 1988 to honor individuals or groups who defend human rights and fundamental freedoms. Sakharov, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, died in 1989. It was the second straight year it has gone to those challenging authoritarian leaders. Last year, it went to the Belarus opposition movement and its leader, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, for their challenge to President Alexander Lukashenko’s rule following a widely disputed election in 2020. —- Associated Press writers Vladimir Isachenkov and Harriet Morris in Moscow, Thomas Adamson in Paris and Sam Petrequin in Brussels contributed. —- This version corrects the euro-dollar conversion rate, with 50,000 euros the equivalent of about $58,200.",western,1,1020,91.17,66.03,11.05,14.82,23.18,33.04,80.49,57.35,43.73,9.02,3.82,0.2,0.29,0.1,2.25,0.49,5.2,15.2,8.73,1.76,13.92,5.29,1.47,5.1,0.49,11.47,6.47,2.45,10.29,1.86,2.65,5.88,6.76,0.59,6.18,1.08,0.78,0.29,0.98,0.2,2.16,0.29,6.96,3.24,3.73,0.2,0,0.2,0.1,0.1,0,0,13.43,6.67,0.88,0.1,1.18,1.18,2.45,6.86,0,0,0.49,2.06,6.18,4.8,1.18,0.2,3.53,0.1,0.2,3.04,0.29,0,1.08,0.59,0,0,0,0,0,0.1,0.1,0,0.2,0.29,0.1,0,0,1.86,0.2,0.39,2.75,8.92,0.39,1.47,6.76,0.49,0.1,0.1,2.25,4.8,3.24,1.27,0.29,0.2,0.1,0,0,17.35,4.8,5.78,0.1,0,2.25,4.41

The rouble firmed by 1.2%, and was set to enjoy its best day in over three weeks despite weakening oil prices. The currency had fallen steeply on Friday amid tensions between Russia and Ukraine that also hurt Russian bonds and stocks. South Africa’s rand firmed around 1%, ahead of domestic inflation data and a monetary policy meeting of the South African Reserve Bank’s (SARB) due on Thursday. The SARB is expected to hold its repo rate at 3.50%. The dollar eased back from near an almost 16-month high versus major peers, as traders await fresh clues on the U.S. economy after soaring inflation numbers led investors to pull forward their Federal Reserve rate hike bets. Turkey’s lira extended losses to a fifth straight session having breached the psychological level of 10 per dollar on Friday. It hit its lowest of 10.04 in early trade on Monday. The Turkish central bank is expected at its next policy meeting on Thursday to cut rates by a further 100 basis points despite soaring inflation, a move that would further pressure the currency. “Turkey is hit by a perfect storm of Fed tightening, a stronger dollar and higher oil prices. We have been very bearish on the lira as we see no policies in place to tackle the economic pressures and, with them also cutting rates again, it is an economic suicide,” said Jakob Christensen, head of EM research at Danske Bank. Turkey’s benchmark stock index surged 3.2% to record highs, led by gains in lender Garanti BBVA, which jumped 10% after Spanish lender BBVA’s 2.25 billion euros ($2.58 billion) offer for a 50.15% stake it does not own. MSCI’s index of EM stocks rose 0.3%, in a sixth straight session of gains - its longest winning streak since early June. Sentiment from upbeat industrial output and retail sales for China were offset by the embattled property sector. Mainland China shares lost but this was outweighed by strong tech gains in Taiwan and South Korea. South African drinks maker Distell Group Holdings dropped over 7% after Heineken’s 40.1 billion rand ($2.62 billion) offer represented a discount to Distell’s last close. Poland’s Central Bank Governor Adam Glapinski said in an interview that rates there were likely to be hiked, prompting a 0.6% jump in the zloty against the euro. It had previously plumbed seven-month lows amid a migrant crisis on its border with Belarus that has increased regional tensions. Argentine markets were also in focus after the ruling Peronists suffered a setback in mid-term elections over the weekend. Telecom Argentina’s Frankfurt listing slid 3.4%.

Hienadz Mazheyka, a Belarusian reporter for Russian daily Komsomolskaya Pravda, was arrested this month after writing about an apartment shootout in Minsk that killed two people — an opposition supporter and an officer of the KGB, Belarus’ state security service. Mazheyka’s report about the shootings in the capital of Belarus, quoted a friend describing the dead opposition supporter in a positive light. The journalist faces up to 12 years in prison on charges of inciting social strife and insulting authorities. Belarusian authorities described the opposition supporter as a “dangerous criminal” and alleged he fatally shot one KGB officer before others fired in return and killed him. The authorities have arrested more than 200 people who posted social media comments about the incident. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said during a visit to Belarus on Thursday that he discussed the Russian media situation in the country and they have a “shared understanding of the need to create maximally comfortable conditions for the Russian media in Belarus and the Belarusian media in Russia,” Lavrov said without elaborating. Komsomolskaya Pravda responded to Mazheyka’s arrest by shutting down its branch in Belarus. Russian officials have voiced regret about the situation, but stopped short of criticizing authorities in Belarus, which has close political, economic and military ties with Russia. Russia has strongly backed Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, who unleashed a fierce crackdown on the opposition and independent media after months of massive protests. More than 35,000 people have been arrested and thousands beaten by police for protesting Lukashenko’s election to a sixth term in an August 2020 vote that the opposition and the West have denounced as a sham. Moscow’s loans and political support have helped Lukashenko shore up his rule amid the demonstrations and Western sanctions. As part of the clampdown, Belarusian authorities have shut down the biggest independent media outlets, blocked access to popular news sites and targeted journalists with raids and detentions. A total of 28 journalists in Belarus, including Mazheyka, are currently behind bars, either already convicted and sentenced or awaiting trial.",western,1,376,98.18,52.76,26.31,1.87,26.86,35.9,80.05,53.99,41.76,4.26,2.39,0,0,0,1.33,0.27,1.86,14.1,10.64,2.39,16.76,3.19,1.86,6.91,0,7.71,5.85,3.99,10.11,1.33,0.53,8.24,6.38,0,5.85,0.53,0.27,0.53,0.53,0,2.93,0,5.05,1.06,3.99,1.06,0.27,0.8,0,0.53,0.27,0,14.1,7.98,0.53,0,2.93,0.27,3.72,5.05,0,0,0,1.33,6.65,2.93,3.19,0.53,3.72,0.27,0.27,2.39,0.53,0.27,1.33,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.06,0.27,0,0,0.53,0,0,0,0.53,0.27,4.79,8.78,0,0.27,8.51,0.27,0,0,4.26,4.79,1.06,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.17,3.72,4.26,0,0,1.6,1.6

In separate written responses delivered to the Russians, the U.S. and NATO held firm to the alliance’s open-door policy for membership, rejected a demand to permanently ban Ukraine from joining, and said allied deployments of troops and military equipment in Eastern Europe are nonnegotiable. “There is no change, there will be no change,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. Also not up for negotiation will be the U.S. and European response to any Russian invasion of Ukraine, he said, repeating the mantra that any such incursion would be met with massive consequences and severe economic costs. The responses were not unexpected and mirrored what senior U.S. and NATO officials have been saying for weeks. Nonetheless, they and the eventual Russian reaction to them could determine whether Europe will again be plunged into war. There was no immediate response from Russia but Russian officials have warned that Moscow would quickly take “retaliatory measures” if the U.S. and its allies reject its demands. Seeking possible off-ramps that would allow Russia to withdraw the estimated 100,000 troops it has deployed near Ukraine’s border without appearing to have lost a battle of wills, the U.S. response did outline areas in which some of Russia’s concerns might be addressed, provided it de-escalates tensions with Ukraine. Speaking to reporters in Washington, Blinken said Russia would not be surprised by the contents of the several-page American document that U.S. Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan delivered Wednesday to the Russian Foreign Ministry. “All told it sets out a serious diplomatic path forward. should Russia choose it,” he said. “The document we’ve delivered includes concerns of the United States and our allies and partners about Russia’s actions that undermine security, a principled and pragmatic evaluation of the concerns that Russia has raised, and our own proposals for areas where we may be able to find common ground.” Blinken said he hoped to speak with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov about the response in the coming days. But he stressed the decision about pursuing diplomacy or conflict rests with Russia and, more specifically, with Russian President Vladimir Putin. “We’ll see how they respond,” he said. “But there’s no doubt in my mind that if Russia were to approach this seriously and in a spirit of reciprocity with a determination to enhance collective security for all of us, there are very positive things in this in this document that could be pursued. We can’t make that decision for President Putin.” Shortly after Blinken spoke, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in Brussels that the alliance had sent a separate reply to Russia with an offer to improve communications, examine ways to avoid military incidents or accidents, and discuss arms control. But, like Blinken, he rejected any attempt to halt membership. “We cannot and will not compromise on the principles on which the security of our alliance, and security in Europe and North America rest,” Stoltenberg said. “This is about respecting nations and their right to choose their own path.” “Russia should refrain from coercive force posturing, aggressive rhetoric and malign activities directed against allies and other nations. Russia should also withdraw its forces from Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova, where they are deployed without these countries’ consent,” he said. While flatly refusing to consider any changes to NATO’s open-door policy, its relationship with non-ally Ukraine, or allied troop and military deployments in Eastern Europe, Blinken said the U.S. is open to other ideas to ease Russia’s stated concerns. The U.S. proposals, echoed in the NATO document, include the potential for negotiations over offensive missile placements and military exercises in Eastern Europe as well as broad arms control agreements as long as Russia withdraws its troops from the Ukrainian border and agrees to halt inflammatory rhetoric designed to deepen divisions and discord among the allies and within Ukraine itself. Moscow has demanded guarantees that NATO will never admit Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations as members and that the alliance will roll back troop deployments in former Soviet bloc nations. Some of these, like the membership pledge, are nonstarters for the U.S. and its allies, creating a seemingly intractable stalemate that many fear can only end in a war. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied it has plans to attack Ukraine, but the U.S. and NATO are worried about Russia massing its troops near Ukraine and conducting a series of sweeping military maneuvers. As part of the drills, motorized infantry and artillery units in southwestern Russia practiced firing live ammunition, warplanes in Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea performed bombing runs, dozens of warships sailed for training exercises in the Black Sea and the Arctic, and Russian fighter jets and paratroopers arrived in Belarus for joint war games. Speaking to Russian lawmakers Wednesday before the U.S. and NATO responses were delivered, Lavrov said he and other top officials will advise Putin on the next steps. “If the West continues its aggressive course, Moscow will take the necessary retaliatory measures,” Lavrov said. But he indicated Russia wouldn’t wait forever. “We won’t allow our proposals to be drowned in endless discussions,” he said. Amid the tensions, the U.S., Britain, Australia, Germany and Canada have moved to withdraw some of their diplomats and dependents from Kyiv, a move President Volodymyr Zelenskyy sought to play down Tuesday as part of a “complex diplomatic game.” On Wednesday, the U.S. urged Americans in Ukraine to consider leaving, saying the security situation “continues to be unpredictable due to the increased threat of Russian military action and can deteriorate with little notice.” In 2014, following the ouster of a Kremlin-friendly president in Kyiv, Moscow annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula and threw its weight behind a separatist insurgency in the country’s eastern industrial heartland. Fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed rebels has killed over 14,000 people, and efforts to reach a settlement have stalled. Envoys from Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany met Wednesday for more than eight hours in Paris on the separatist conflict. Although there was no breakthrough, they promised to meet for new talks in two weeks in Berlin. The French president’s office said afterward in a statement that the parties support “unconditional respect” for a cease-fire in eastern Ukraine. The talks focused on the 2015 Minsk peace agreement aimed at ending the conflict, and the statement didn’t address the current concerns about a Russian invasion of Ukraine. “Those are different issues, and we didn’t discuss it,” said Kremlin envoy Dmitry Kozak. The Ukrainian representative, Andriy Yermak, was cautiously optimistic about Wednesday’s talks, which he said marked the first major advance since December 2019. He also acknowledged they did not directly address current tensions at the border or resolve past differences. “Of course, I wouldn’t be honest if I said that we all want faster and bigger results,” Yermak said. “And of course there is nothing bigger than the desire of Ukrainian people to stop the war, to bring back our territories and our people.” Yermak also said the Ukrainians repeatedly raised the issue of troops now massed on the border. “This is the real threat,” he said. “I have clearly said today that we expect de-escalation not only around occupied territories but also in general de-escalation around Ukrainian borders.” Kozak said varying interpretations of the Minsk agreement have remained a major stumbling block. He said the the four parties will make another attempt to reach consensus on the issue in two weeks. Kozak reaffirmed that Russia isn’t a party to the conflict and emphasized that Ukraine is reluctant to engage in talks with separatists as stipulated in the Minsk document. He said there has been no progress on key aspects of the agreement that Ukraine must grant special status to the rebel regions, followed by elections. ___ Isachenkov reported from Moscow.

REUTERS/Yves Herman LONDON, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Eastern and central Europe's normally predictable financial markets are suddenly alive with the most diverse geopolitical and economic risks the region has faced in decades, and international investors are starting to pay attention. The list makes worrying reading. The European Union faces a migrant crisis on its eastern borders the bloc says is being fomented by Belarus, tensions between Ukraine and Russia have flared up again, Brussels is locked in a dispute with the Polish and Hungarian governments over rule of law and democracy, and Romania has no government. Money managers have long viewed the region as a sort of hybrid - part euro zone satellite bloc with ultra-low interest rates to boot, but also not fully out of Russia's orbit especially at the fringes. The latest series of events though, which importantly for market watchers comes against a backdrop of one of the strongest inflation surges since the end of the Cold War and rising COVID-19 cases, has been impossible to compartmentalise. Hungary's forint , a 12-year low Polish zloty , Romania's leu  and Russia  and Belarus' roubles  are five of the eight worst performing world currencies this month and eastern European stocks (.MIME00000PUS) are having their worst one in over a year. Government bonds have been suffering as rising inflation  crushes the real-term income they provide. Polish, Hungarian and Romanian bonds now have some of the most negative 'real yields' -- the interest rate once inflation is factored in -- anywhere in the emerging world, even lower than Turkey. Ukraine's bonds  have slumped 10% as Russian tanks have neared its borders again, while the threat that Western governments might ban banks and funds from owning Russian sovereign debt altogether has hit Moscow's market. ""Welcome back to emerging markets,"" JPMorgan headlined a report on Wednesday on the growing pressures in the region after the years of relative calm. This week's flash points saw the EU toughen sanctions on Belarus for encouraging thousands of people fleeing war-torn countries to try to cross into EU nations like Poland, an accusation Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko denies.  read more Meanwhile NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned Russia on Monday the western military alliance was standing by Ukraine amid what he called a ""significant"" build-up of Russian troops near the border.  read more Romania is still trying to cobble together a government while calls for separatism in Bosnia have brought warnings of a return to the ethnic conflicts in the Balkans.  read more ""We have seen an effect across most assets,"" said Viktor Szabo, a portfolio manager at investment firm abrdn, citing the drops in Ukraine's hryvnia currency, Russia's rouble and some of the region's government bonds. SHARP DETERIORATION While the geopolitical tensions have dominated the headlines, UBS's head of emerging market strategy Manik Narain warns about a sharp deterioration of broader economic fundamentals in CEE. A rise in imports and supply chain issues in key export sectors like car manufacturing are likely to result in Poland's first negative trade balance since 2012, Narain said. A long-running row with Brussels about Warsaw overriding parts of EU law could be costly too if it isn't resolved. The EU is currently withholding Poland's 36 billion euro- share ($40.7 billion) of its Covid-19 recovery fund, equivalent to roughly 1% of the country's GDP. That could jump to 4-4.5% of GDP though if traditional EU development funding, worth more than 120 billion euros over the next six years, is also stopped. JPMorgan estimates the deterioration in current account positions implies a GDP deficit of 2.3% in Poland, of 1.8% in the Czech Republic and 2.9% in Hungary. That could see currencies weakening further and together with this year's 300% surge in gas prices fuel inflation and force central banks to keep raising rates. ""If balance of payments deterioration proves more permanent, we expect higher FX volatility in the region,"" JPMorgan said. Every 1% of GDP current account deterioration requires interest rates to be 50 basis points higher than they otherwise would have been, calculates JPMorgan. Borrowing costs would have to rise too. Inflation for big three CEE economies - Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary -  currently averages around 6.5%. If it ends up settling between 3-5%, 10-year bond yields in the region would hit 3.9%-5.2% - far higher than in recent years. Lyubka Dushanova, an emerging market specialist at State Street Global Advisors, reckons that CEE central banks being behind the curve and losing inflation-fighting credibility causes market weakness. ""It is difficult to distil the geopolitical tensions from the macroeconomic backdrop,"" Dushanova said. ""We are probably going to see some rocky times in the region.""

Putin’s move follows days of heightened tensions in Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland, where Ukrainian forces are locked in a nearly eight-year conflict with Russia-backed separatists that has left more than 14,000 people dead. Here is a look at the rebel-controlled territories in eastern Ukraine: SEPARATIST REBELLION IN THE EAST When Ukraine’s Moscow-friendly president was driven from office by mass protests in February 2014, Russia responded by annexing Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula. It then threw its weight behind an insurgency in the mostly Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine region known as Donbas. In April 2014, Russia-backed rebels seized government buildings in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, proclaimed the creation of “people’s republics” and battled Ukrainian troops and volunteer battalions. The following month, the separatist regions held a popular vote to declare independence and make a bid to become part of Russia. Moscow hasn’t accepted the motion, just used the regions as a tool to keep Ukraine in its orbit and prevent it from joining NATO. Ukraine and the West accused Russia of backing the rebels with troops and weapons. Moscow denied that, saying any Russians who fought there were volunteers. Amid ferocious battles involving tanks, heavy artillery and warplanes, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014, killing all 298 people aboard. An international probe concluded that the passenger jet was downed by a Russia-supplied missile from the rebel-controlled territory in Ukraine. Moscow still denied any involvement. PEACE AGREEMENTS FOR EASTERN UKRAINE After a massive defeat of Ukrainian troops in August 2014, envoys from Kyiv, the rebels and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe signed a truce in the Belarusian capital of Minsk in September 2014. The document envisaged an OSCE-observed cease-fire, a pullback of all foreign fighters, an exchange of prisoners and hostages, an amnesty for the rebels and a promise that separatist regions could have a degree of self-rule. The deal quickly collapsed and large-scale fighting resumed, leading to another major defeat for Ukrainian forces at Debaltseve in January-February of 2015. France and Germany brokered another peace agreement, which was signed in Minsk in February 2015 by representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the rebels. It envisaged a new cease-fire, a pullback of heavy weapons and a series of moves toward a political settlement. A declaration backing the deal was signed by the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany. A FROZEN CONFLICT IN UKRAINE The 2015 peace deal was a major diplomatic coup for the Kremlin, obliging Ukraine to grant special status to the separatist regions, allowing them to create their own police force and have a say in appointing local prosecutors and judges. It also envisaged that Ukraine could only regain control over the roughly 200-kilometer (125-mile) border with Russia in rebel regions after they get self-rule and hold OSCE-monitored local elections — balloting that would almost certainly keep pro-Moscow rebels in power there. Many Ukrainians see it as a betrayal of national interests and its implementation has stalled. The Minsk document helped end full-scale fighting, but the situation has remained tense and regular skirmishes have continued. With the Minsk deal stalled, Moscow’s hope to use rebel regions to directly influence Ukraine’s politics has failed but the frozen conflict has drained Kyiv’s resources and effectively stymied its goal of joining NATO — which is enshrined in the Ukrainian constitution. Moscow also has worked to secure its hold on the rebel regions by handing out more than 720,000 Russian passports to roughly one-fifth of their population of about 3.6 million. It has provided economic and financial assistance to the separatist territories, but the aid has been insufficient to alleviate the massive damage from fighting and shore up the economy. The Donbas region accounted for about 16% of Ukraine’s GDP before the conflict. EFFORTS TO REVIVE PEACE DEAL Amid soaring tensions over the Russian troop concentration near Ukraine, France and Germany embarked on renewed efforts to encourage compliance with the 2015 deal, in hopes that it could help defuse the current standoff. Facing calls from Berlin and Paris for its implementation, Ukrainian officials have strengthened their criticism of the Minsk deal and warned that it could lead to the country’s demise. Two rounds of talks in Paris and Berlin between presidential envoys from Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany have yielded no progress. The lower house of the Russian parliament, meanwhile, urged Putin last week to recognize the independence of Ukraine’s rebel regions. PUTIN RECOGNIZES REBEL REGIONS’ INDEPENDENCE Putin’s recognition of the rebel-held territories’ independence effectively shatters the Minsk peace agreements and will further fuel tensions with the West. He said that Moscow would sign friendship treaties with the rebel territories, a move that could pave the way for Russia to openly support them with troops and weapons. The move follows several days of shelling that erupted along the line of contact in Donetsk and Luhansk. Ukraine and the West accused Moscow of fomenting the tensions to create a pretext for an invasion. Russia, in turn, accused Ukraine of trying to reclaim the rebel-held territories by force, the claim that Kyiv strongly rejected. On Friday, separatist leaders released video statements announcing the evacuation of civilians in the face of what they described as a Ukrainian “aggression.” The data embedded in the video indicated that their statements had been pre-recorded two days earlier when the situation was still relatively calm, suggesting a deliberate plan to try to sever the regions from Ukraine. The rebel chiefs put out new video statements Monday urging Putin to recognize their regions’ independence and the Russian leader responded quickly by convening a carefully orchestrated meeting of his Security Council and then signing the recognition decrees in a televised ceremony. ___ Yuras Karmanau in Kyiv, Ukraine and Edith M.

REUTERS/Alexander Ermochenko Dec 6 (Reuters) - The United States has warned Russia not to invade Ukraine and urged both countries to return to a set of agreements designed to end a separatist war by Russian-speakers in eastern Ukraine.  read more Here is a look at the agreements, which were signed in Minsk in 2014 and 2015. Ukraine and the Russian-backed separatists agreed a 12-point ceasefire deal in the capital of Belarus in September 2014. Its provisions included prisoner exchanges, deliveries of humanitarian aid and the withdrawal of heavy weapons, five months into a conflict that by that point had killed more than 2,600 people - a toll that has risen to more than 14,000 now, according to the Ukrainian government. The agreement quickly broke down, with violations by both sides. Representatives of Russia, Ukraine, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the leaders of two pro-Russian separatist regions signed a 13-point agreement in February 2015 in Minsk. The leaders of France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine gathered there at the same time and issued a declaration of support for the deal. The deal set out a series of military and political steps that remain unimplemented. A major blockage has been Russia's insistence that it is not a party to the conflict and therefore is not bound by its terms. Point 10, for example, calls for the withdrawal of all foreign armed formations and military equipment from the two disputed regions, Donetsk and Luhansk: Ukraine says this refers to forces from Russia, but Moscow denies it has any there. The 13 points were, in brief: 1. An immediate and comprehensive ceasefire 2. Withdrawal of all heavy weapons by both sides 3. Monitoring and verification by the OSCE 4. To start a dialogue on interim self-government for the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, in accordance with Ukrainian law, and acknowledge their special status by a resolution of parliament. 5. A pardon and amnesty for people involved in the fighting 6. An exchange of hostages and prisoners. 7. Provision of humanitarian assistance. 8. Resumption of socio-economic ties, including pensions. 9. Restore full control of the state border by the government of Ukraine. 10. Withdrawal of all foreign armed formations, military equipment and mercenaries. 11. Constitutional reform in Ukraine including decentralisation, with specific mention of Donetsk and Luhansk. 12.

362,apnews.com,2021-12-06 08:00:00,https://apnews.com/5e7fe3c53de64ad73abbcc7a163f199b,"Belarus bans Western imports , airlines from EU and united kingdom ",English,United States,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Belarus on Monday announced retaliatory restrictions on airlines from the European Union and the U.K., as well as a ban on imports of Western goods from countries that have introduced sanctions against the former Soviet nation. The import ban comes in response to the “illegal external sanctions pressure aimed at undermining the sovereignty of Belarus and deterioration of the well-being of Belarusian citizens,” Belarus’ Foreign Ministry said in a statement. The Belarus government has not yet published the list of prohibited Western goods. Last week, the United States, EU, Britain and Canada slapped simultaneous sanctions on dozens of Belarussian officials, organizations and companies, with the EU targeting those accused of participating in a “hybrid attack” on the bloc using migrants as pawns on the borders of Poland, Lithuania and Latvia. The EU has also imposed travel bans and asset freezes on 17 more people from Belarus, including senior border guards and military officials, government representatives and judges. The measures also hit airlines — including state carrier Belavia — and travel groups accused by the EU of helping to bring migrants to Belarus with the aim of helping them cross into the 27-country bloc. Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko said Monday the sanctions will not do any tangible harm. “Of course, there is nothing good in this,” Lukashenko said at a meeting in Minsk. “But to lie down today, fold your arms over your chest and die, there is no reason for that.” Lukashenko said Belarus has managed to maintain economic growth. The economy contracted 0.9% last year, but according to October forecasts, the World Bank expects GDP to grow by 1.2% in 2021. Analysts say Russia is throwing a lifeline to the Belarusian economy by providing loans, selling oil and gas to the country at domestic prices and opening the Russian market to Belarusian goods. Russian President Vladimir Putin backed Lukashenko during the massive anti-government protests last year following a presidential election in August 2020 that the opposition and the West said was rigged. Putin offered Belarus a $1.5 billion loan and pledged military aid. “Lukashenko is ready to intensify confrontation with the West and be at the forefront of Kremlin’s plans, since Moscow still pays for Minsk’s anti-Western rhetoric,” independent analyst Valery Karbalevich told The Associated Press. “Western sanctions will hurt sensitive sectors of the Belarusian economy, but they will be compensated for Belarusians out of Russian pockets.” ___ Follow all AP stories on developments in Belarus at https://apnews.com/hub/Belarus.",western,1,415,98.29,42.89,21.3,8.85,24.41,33.73,77.35,50.36,40.24,2.41,1.2,0,0,0.72,0,0.48,1.2,12.29,9.16,2.17,16.87,3.61,1.69,5.78,0.96,9.16,3.13,1.93,6.99,0.72,0.72,5.54,5.3,0.72,4.58,0.48,0.96,0.24,0.48,0.48,1.93,0,4.1,1.45,2.65,1.2,0.48,0.72,0,0.24,0,0,8.92,6.02,0.96,0,1.69,0.72,2.65,2.65,0,0,0,0,8.19,5.54,2.41,0.24,5.06,0,0,1.93,3.37,0,1.45,0.24,0,0.24,0,0,0,0,0.24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.24,0.24,0,3.13,8.67,0,1.2,7.23,0,0,0.48,3.13,3.37,2.17,1.69,0.72,0.72,0.24,0,0,17.83,5.54,5.06,0,0,0.72,6.51

Lukashenko also warned that his country will stand squarely behind its ally Russia if the Ukrainian authorities launch an offensive against Moscow-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine. He tried to cast the tensions over migrants as part of a purported Western plot against Belarus and Russia. Lukashenko said at a meeting with his top military brass that Belarusian border guards found the bodies of two migrants left on the border over the weekend. “They put a dead body, or, probably, a person who is still alive, in a sleeping bag and toss it on the border,” Lukashenko exclaimed. “What an abomination!” Lithuania’s State Border Guard Service rejected the Belarusian claim, saying that Belarusian authorities have repeatedly tried to stage and direct beatings, the crippling or even deaths of migrants, while blaming Lithuania for such “inhumane treatment.” Lukashenko also charged Monday that Belarusian border guards also found several other freezing migrants who were barely alive at an abandoned farmhouse near the border with Lithuania. The EU has accused Lukashenko of waging a “hybrid attack” against the bloc, using desperate migrants as pawns and tricking them into trying to cross into EU members Poland and Lithuania to destabilize the entire bloc. The EU says that is Lukashenko’s revenge for EU sanctions imposed on Belarus after its brutal crackdown on democracy protesters. Belarusian authorities have denied the accusations and shot back at the EU, accusing it of failing to offer safe passage to migrants. Since Nov. 8, a large group of migrants, mostly Iraqi Kurds, has been stranded in Belarus at a border crossing with Poland, trapped amid freezing temperatures as forces from the two countries face off. Most of the migrants are fleeing conflict or hopelessness at home, and aim to reach Germany or other Western European countries. On Monday, Lukashenko had a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin in which they talked about the situation on Belarus’ border with Poland, according to the Kremlin. The Belarusian leader also ordered military officials Monday to raise troop readiness in view of NATO maneuvers near Belarusian borders. Lukashenko dismissed Western concerns about alleged Russian plans to invade Ukraine, which also borders Belarus, saying that Moscow would have let him know about it if it had such intentions. But echoing statements from the Kremlin, he warned Ukrainian authorities that if they try to use force to reclaim areas controlled by Russia-backed separatists in Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland known as Donbas, Belarus would stand squarely with Russia. “If they try to launch a small war in Donbas or somewhere on the border with Russia, Belarus will not stay aside, and it’s clear whose side it will take,” he said. Belarusian Defense Minister Lt. Gen. Viktor Khrenin said in the “medium term” Belarus and Russia will conduct joint drills to protect Belarus’ border with Ukraine. Ukrainian authorities have voiced concerns that Russian troops could use Belarusian territory to invade Ukraine. The Kremlin has denied plans to launch such attack and accused Ukrainian authorities and their Western backers of making the claims to cover up their own allegedly aggressive designs. ___ Liudas Dapkus in Vilnius, Lithuania, and Yuras Karmanau in Kyiv, Ukraine, contributed to this report.",western,1,566,94.39,45.29,35.53,1,22.64,32.16,78.45,51.77,42.05,6.54,2.83,0,0,0,1.06,1.24,3.71,12.01,7.42,0.71,16.25,3.89,2.47,6.18,0.18,9.54,4.42,1.59,8.66,0.88,1.59,6.18,8.48,0,8.48,1.06,1.59,1.06,2.65,0,3.53,0,4.42,0.18,4.24,0.88,0,0.88,0,0.53,0.18,0,11.48,6.89,0.35,0,3.36,1.41,2.3,4.59,0,0.18,0,1.06,7.24,2.12,5.12,0,1.41,0.18,0.35,0.88,0,0,1.41,0.35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.35,0.18,0,0.35,0,0,0,0,0.88,0,2.12,12.72,0.35,1.59,10.25,0.18,0.18,0.35,1.77,3.18,1.41,1.06,0,0,0,0,0,13.78,4.24,4.95,0,0.18,1.06,3.36
780,apnews.com,2022-02-12 08:00:00,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-joe-biden-emmanuel-macron-europe-moscow-1f353699f0be1609da5435c98cfc8022,"Putin , Biden plan high - stakes phone call in Ukraine crisis",English,United States,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden told Russia’s Vladimir Putin that invading Ukraine would cause “widespread human suffering” and that the West was committed to diplomacy to end the crisis but “equally prepared for other scenarios,” the White House said Saturday. It offered no suggestion that the hourlong call diminished the threat of an imminent war in Europe. Biden also said the United States and its allies would respond “decisively and impose swift and severe costs” if the Kremlin attacked its neighbor, according to the White House. The two presidents spoke a day after Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, warned that U.S. intelligence shows a Russian invasion could begin within days and before the Winter Olympics in Beijing end on Feb. 20. Russia denies it intends to invade but has massed well over 100,000 troops near the Ukrainian border and has sent troops to exercises in neighboring Belarus, encircling Ukraine on three sides. U.S. officials say Russia’s buildup of firepower has reached the point where it could invade on short notice. The conversation came at a critical moment for what has become the biggest security crisis between Russia and the West since the Cold War. U.S. officials believe they have mere days to prevent an invasion and enormous bloodshed in Ukraine. And while the U.S. and its NATO allies have no plans to send troops to Ukraine to fight Russia, an invasion and resulting punishing sanctions could reverberate far beyond the former Soviet republic, affecting energy supplies, global markets and the power balance in Europe. “President Biden was clear with President Putin that while the United States remains prepared to engage in diplomacy, in full coordination with our Allies and partners, we are equally prepared for other scenarios,” the White House statement said. The call was “professional and substantive” but produced “no fundamental change in the dynamic that has been unfolding now for several weeks,” according to a senior administration official who briefed reporters following the call on condition of anonymity. The official added that it remains unclear whether Putin has made a final decision to move forward with military action. Yuri Ushakov, Putin’s top foreign policy aide, said that while tensions have been escalating for months, in recent days “the situation has simply been brought to the point of absurdity.” He said Biden mentioned the possible sanctions that could be imposed on Russia, but “this issue was not the focus during a fairly long conversation with the Russian leader.” Before talking to Biden, Putin had a telephone call with French President Emmanuel Macron, who met with him in Moscow earlier in the week to try to resolve the crisis. A Kremlin summary of the call suggested that little progress was made toward cooling down the tensions. Putin complained in the call that the United States and NATO have not responded satisfactorily to Russian demands that Ukraine be prohibited from joining the military alliance and that NATO pull back forces from Eastern Europe. In a sign that American officials are getting ready for a worst-case scenario, the United States announced plans to evacuate most of its staff from the embassy in the Ukrainian capital. Britain joined other European nations in urging its citizens to leave Ukraine. Canada has shuttered its embassy in Kyiv and relocated its diplomatic staff to a temporary office in Lviv, located in the western part of the country, Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly said Saturday. Lviv is home to a Ukrainian military base that has served as the main hub for Canada’s 200-soldier training mission in the former Soviet country. The timing of any possible Russian military action remained a key question. The U.S. picked up intelligence that Russia is looking at Wednesday as a target date, according to a U.S. official familiar with the findings. The official, who was not authorized to speak publicly and did so only on condition of anonymity, would not say how definitive the intelligence was. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he told his Russian counterpart Saturday that “further Russian aggression would be met with a resolute, massive and united trans-Atlantic response.” Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy tried to project calm as he observed military exercises Saturday near Crimea, the peninsula that Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014. “We are not afraid, we’re without panic, all is under control,” he said. Ukrainian armed forces chief commander Lt. Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhny and Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov issued a more defiant joint statement. “We are ready to meet the enemy, and not with flowers, but with Stingers, Javelins and NLAWs” — anti-tank and -aircraft weapons, they said. “Welcome to hell!” U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu, also held telephone discussions on Saturday. Further U.S.-Russia tensions arose on Saturday when the Defense Ministry summoned the U.S. Embassy’s military attache after it said the navy detected an American submarine in Russian waters near the Kuril Islands in the Pacific. The submarine declined orders to leave, but departed after the navy used unspecified “appropriate means,” the ministry said. Adding to the sense of crisis, the Pentagon ordered an additional 3,000 U.S. troops to Poland to reassure allies. The U.S. has urged all American citizens in Ukraine to leave the country immediately, and Sullivan said those who remain should not expect the U.S. military to rescue them in the event that air and rail transportation is severed after a Russian invasion. The Biden administration has been warning for weeks that Russia could invade Ukraine soon, but U.S. officials had previously said the Kremlin would likely wait until after the Winter Games ended so as not to antagonize China. Sullivan told reporters on Friday that U.S. intelligence shows that Russia could take invade during the Olympics. He said military action could start with missile and air attacks, followed by a ground offensive. “Russia has all the forces it needs to conduct a major military action,” Sullivan said, adding that “Russia could choose, in very short order, to commence a major military action against Ukraine.” He said the scale of such an invasion could range from a limited incursion to a strike on Kyiv, the capital. Russia scoffed at the U.S. talk of urgency. “The hysteria of the White House is more indicative than ever,” said Maria Zakharova, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman. “The Anglo-Saxons need a war. At any cost. Provocations, misinformation and threats are a favorite method of solving their own problems.” Zakharova said her country had “optimized” staffing at its own embassy in Kyiv in response to concerns about possible military actions from the Ukrainian side. In addition to the more than 100,000 ground troops that U.S. officials say Russia has assembled along Ukraine’s eastern and southern borders, the Russians have deployed missile, air, naval and special operations forces, as well as supplies to sustain a war. This week, Russia moved six amphibious assault ships into the Black Sea, augmenting its capability to land marines on the coast. Biden has bolstered the U.S. military presence in Europe as reassurance to allies on NATO’s eastern flank. The 3,000 additional soldiers ordered to Poland come on top of 1,700 who are on their way there. The U.S. Army also is shifting 1,000 soldiers from Germany to Romania, which like Poland shares a border with Ukraine. Russia is demanding that the West keep former Soviet countries out of NATO. It also wants NATO to refrain from deploying weapons near its border and to roll back alliance forces from Eastern Europe — demands flatly rejected by the West. Russia and Ukraine have been locked in a bitter conflict since 2014, when Ukraine’s Kremlin-friendly leader was driven from office by a popular uprising. Moscow responded by annexing the Crimean Peninsula and then backing a separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine, where fighting has killed over 14,000 people. A 2015 peace deal brokered by France and Germany helped halt large-scale battles, but regular skirmishes have continued, and efforts to reach a political settlement have stalled. ___ Heintz reported from Moscow.

While that serves his purpose, it is also a fiction. Ukraine has its own thousand-year history. What is now Ukraine was a contested region of shifting borders for centuries that did not come completely under Moscow’s rule until late in the 18th century during the reign of Catherine the Great, and even then the Russian Empire was never able to swallow it easily or completely. In his present-day effort to bring an independent, Western-looking Ukraine back into Russia’s orbit, Putin is following a well-trod path of many of Russia’s rulers before him — from Peter the Great to Josef Stalin. For the West, the question is whether it can limit Putin’s revanchist ambitions through diplomacy, sanctions and Ukrainian military resistance. The recognition of the two breakaway regions by Putin, and the sending in of Russian troops already threatening the country, could easily be the trigger for a wider war for all of Ukraine. “I consider it necessary to take a long-overdue decision: To immediately recognize the independence and sovereignty of Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic,” Putin said, referring to two pro-Russian parts of Ukraine in the Donbas region that since 2014 have been engaged in a war with the Kyiv government that has claimed an estimated 14,000 lives already. Every modern state, especially in Europe, has had centuries of changing borders, and the emotional tug of nationalism can lead to demands, ultimatums and often war for territory, power and influence. In his speech to the Russian public on Monday night, a sometimes sullen, sometimes angry-sounding Putin was dismissive of modern-day Ukraine, arguing that its creation as a sovereign state was a tragedy and an accident of communist leaders in the 20th century. Acting as though there had never been a historical Ukraine until Soviet times, Putin blamed at times Vladimir Lenin, at times Stalin and at one point he saved scorn for the decision of Nikita Khrushchev to take Crimea from Russia in 1954 and award it to Ukraine. As with all historical narratives, there were elements of truth in what Putin was saying. Ukrainians and Russians are related eastern Slavic peoples whose destinies have been both intertwined and separated throughout history. But he preferred to focus on the time of Russia’s maximum dominance over Ukraine — neatly forgetting that it has been a separate state recognized by international treaties and explicitly by Russia over the last 30 years. Instead, he painted today’s Ukraine as a corrupt, barely functioning puppet of the United States that threatens Russia’s security and, in his view, has no real reason to exist except in union with Russia. Both Ukraine and Russia trace themselves to Kievan Rus, a trading center set up by Vikings along the Dnieper River more than 1,000 years ago, before Moscow even existed, that was originally pagan and later embraced Orthodox Christianity. Kievan Rus fell afterward to the early 13th century Mongol invasions of Europe. Muscovy did not emerge from being a vassal state until the late 15th century. Instead of being connected to Russian Moscow, all of what is now Ukraine instead for centuries was part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from the 1300s, and later of the Union of Poland and Lithuania, a vast multilingual, multiethnic state whose territory encompassed almost all of what is now Poland, Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine (and parts of what is now Russia.) In its eastern and southeastern regions, the union’s dominant languages were Polish and Ruthenian, the predecessor to modern-day Ukrainian and Belarusian. The population included Ukrainians, Poles, Belarusians, Lithuanians, Jews and Tartars. Uprisings by an army of Ukrainian Cossacks against Polish lords and landowners in the middle 1600s led to a Cossack alliance with Moscow and eastern Ukraine breaking off from the Polish-Lithuanian Union and pledging loyalty to the czar in 1654. Western Ukraine remained part of the Polish-Lithuanian Union for another 150 years, until Poland was partitioned for the final time in 1795 and erased from the map of Europe. Poland rose again after World War I and fought a territorial war with Soviet Russia between 1919 and 1922, winning back much of Ukraine. Those lands returned to Soviet control a generation later during and after World War II, but after the war Ukrainian nationalist partisans fought on against the Soviets in a guerrilla resistance for several years. The “great famine” or Holodomor imposed on Ukraine by Stalin in the early 1930s had led to millions of deaths and seeded lingering Ukrainian bitterness toward Soviet Russian rule. That the Bolsheviks recognized Ukraine as a separate socialist republic when the Soviet Union was created was no accident. It addressed the reality of Ukraine’s separate history and identity, poised somewhere between Moscow and the West for most of its existence, but never given the chance to rule itself until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Contrary to Putin, most Ukrainians do not clamor to be part of Russia today, and anti-Russian sentiment in most of the country has only increased since Russia’s 2014 seizure of Crimea and the taking of the Donbas region by pro-Moscow separatists. Now with Russian troops marching into the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine again, it looks as though the millennial-long tug of war for dominance in the area, with the use of force of arms or diplomacy as needed, is about to renew again. ___ EDITOR’S NOTE — John Daniszewski, an AP vice president and former correspondent in Eastern Europe, has written about European affairs since the 1980s.",western,1,934,94.19,27.76,75.65,13.37,30.13,28.8,80.62,58.03,48.72,4.71,1.5,0.21,0,0,0.96,0.11,3.21,13.28,8.67,2.78,18.31,5.14,4.39,7.71,0.86,8.46,4.39,4.82,6.64,1.28,0.86,4.6,9.85,1.18,8.57,1.18,1.71,0.54,1.28,0.43,3.75,0.11,3,1.07,1.71,0.64,0,0.43,0,0.21,0.11,0,4.93,2.14,0.21,0,0.54,0.21,0.75,2.57,0,0,0,1.07,5.46,2.89,2.57,0,1.18,0,0,0.75,0.11,0.43,0.54,0.11,0.11,0,0,0,0,0.11,0.11,0.21,0,0.32,0.11,0,0,0.21,0.43,0.21,2.68,10.06,0.11,0.86,9.21,0.21,0,0,8.24,5.14,3.1,0.21,0,0,0,0,0,13.6,3.32,6,0,0,1.5,2.78

Despite Russian warning , Ukraine talks go on",English,United States,"MOSCOW (AP) — When the U.S. and NATO rejected the Kremlin’s security demands over Ukraine last week, fears of an imminent Russian attack against its neighbor soared. But instead of sending armored armadas across the Ukrainian border as the U.S. and its allies worried, Moscow bombarded Western capitals with diplomatic letters about an international agreement that the Kremlin sees as a strong argument for its position in the standoff. Even though President Vladimir Putin said a month ago that he wanted a quick answer to the Russian demands and warned that Moscow would not accept “idle talk,” earlier this week he signaled an apparent readiness for more talks with Washington and NATO. And that offers a glimmer of hope. Although more than 100,000 Russian troops still hover near Ukraine and weeks of talks have led to no major concessions by either side, at least Russia and the West keep talking, and for some experts that’s a reason for cautious optimism. “On the one hand Putin did fire rhetorical barbs against the West and emphasized perceived slights; on the other hand he also did leave open the possibility of talking in more detail about at least some of the issues where the West has been willing to engage,” said Jeff Rathke, a former U.S. diplomat and president of the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies at Johns Hopkins University. “We’re kind of where we were a few weeks ago,” Rathke said. “Putin has kept his options open. He’s not ruled out talks but also not reduced his strident rhetoric.” Russia and the West remain far apart on the most critical issues and it’s unclear how a compromise could be reached. But the Kremlin’s recent emphasis on diplomacy appears to reflect Putin’s hope to achieve his goals through negotiations while using the deployment of the troops near Ukraine as leverage. “Russia will maintain a tough stand while indicating that it’s not shutting the door to talks,” said Fyodor Lukyanov, who heads the Moscow-based Council for Foreign and Defense Policies and closely follows the Kremlin thinking. “Such complex agreements aren’t reached in a relaxing atmosphere over a cup of tea, so all methods of persuasion are being used, including the demonstration of force.” Russia maintains it has no intention to attack its neighbor, but it demands that NATO bar membership to Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations and pledge not to deploy weapons there. It also wants NATO deployments in Eastern Europe rolled back. The U.S. and its allies flatly rejected those demands as “nonstarters” during a series of talks last month, but Moscow demanded a written reply, fueling suspicions that it wanted a formal rejection of its demands to use as an argument for sending troops into Ukraine. The U.S. and NATO handed their response to Moscow on Jan. 26, ruling out any concessions on Russia’s main demands but holding the door open for talks on other issues, including limits on offensive missile deployments, greater transparency of military drills and other confidence-building measures. Putin has yet to formulate his response to the Western proposals, but his diplomats have warned it will be difficult to achieve any progress on those issues if the West continues to stonewall Moscow’s main demands. The deadlock has fueled fears of imminent hostilities, and in a phone call last week U.S. President Joe Biden warned Ukraine’s president that there is a “distinct possibility” Russia will invade in February. Moscow appears to have opted for a diplomatic track for now and U.S. officials in recent days have toned down their rhetoric about “imminence.” But the U.S. has not backed away from the urgency of its concerns. A week ago, Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov sent new letters to his Western counterparts, countering NATO’s argument that every country has the right to choose alliances. He charged that the alliance’s expansion contradicts its obligation not to strengthen its security at Russia’s expense. Lavrov said the U.S, and its allies have pledged to respect the “indivisibility of security” in documents signed at summits of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the main trans-Atlantic security grouping. “There must be security for all or there will be no security for anyone,” Lavrov wrote, noting that his ministry would now wait for formal replies to his letter before advising Putin on next moves. The exchange of letters could set the stage for a long series of arcane arguments about conflicting interpretations of the OSCE documents, and Putin expressed readiness for such discussions. In his first public remarks on the standoff since late December, the Russian leader noted Tuesday that while the West rejects Russia’s key demands, diplomatic efforts should continue. “I hope that we will eventually find a solution, although we realize that it’s not going to be easy,” Putin said. The patient stand contrasted with Putin’s statement in December that he wants a quick Western reply and could order unspecified “military-technical measures” if the U.S. and its allies continue to ignore Moscow’s concerns. Putin made no mention of any such measures in his comments this week, saying that “we need to find a way to ensure interests and security of all parties, including Ukraine, European nations and Russia.” Along with the talks with the U.S. and NATO, Russia also engaged in separate negotiations on a stalled 2015 peace deal for eastern Ukraine. A four-way meeting in Paris between presidential envoys from Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany didn’t produce immediate progress, but they will meet again in Berlin this month. French President Emmanuel Macron, who has spoken to Putin three times since last Friday, will visit Moscow and Kyiv on Monday and Tuesday in a bid to help defuse tensions, and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will also travel to both Ukraine and Russia on Feb. 14-15. Lukyanov said Russia will likely keep flexing its military muscle to demonstrate its resolve. He noted that Russia could easily afford keeping troops near Ukraine for a long time and will continue a series of drills to maintain pressure on the West. “Troops may come and go,” Lukyanov said. “It’s relatively cheap and within the funds already earmarked for combat training.” The drills include sweeping joint war games with Russia’s ally Belarus, which borders Ukraine to the north, and Lukyanov predicted that Russia could further beef up its defense ties with the country. Belarus’ authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko, who has edged closer to Moscow after being hit with Western sanctions over his crackdown on dissent, already has offered to host Russian nuclear weapons. “Belarus will be an important element in the game,” Lukyanov said. ___ Lee reported from Washington.",western,1,1100,88.09,44.91,38.74,15.18,25.58,28.55,81.36,59.18,46.18,7.27,2.82,0.09,0.45,0.09,1.64,0.27,4.45,15.45,7.82,0.64,14.91,5.36,3.09,6.73,1.27,11.73,6.82,3.18,7.36,2.27,0.73,4.45,11,0.91,10,1.45,1.27,1.73,1.91,0.27,3.82,0,4.82,2.18,2.64,1.36,0.45,0.91,0.27,0.55,0,0,12.82,7.73,1.18,0.27,1.45,0.09,4.27,5.45,0,0.09,0,1.73,4.55,3.36,1,0.18,2.64,0.36,0.27,1.55,0.27,0.18,0.55,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.18,0,0.27,0.64,0.09,0,0,0,0.09,1.09,0.09,3.45,10.18,0.73,0.82,8,0.64,0,0.09,5.73,3.55,3.36,2.27,0.09,0.09,0,0,0,16.64,5.82,4.36,0,0,2.18,4.27

Diplomats and government leaders, meanwhile, struggled ever more to jumpstart moribund talks to stave off full-out war. Here’s a look at what is happening where and why: STARK WARNINGS FROM THE WHITE HOUSE The White House said it still didn’t know if Russian President Vladimir Putin had made a decision to invade, but it said Putin has assembled all the elements to do so quickly. The United States is set to evacuate its embassy in Kyiv and has told Americans in Ukraine to leave within the next 48 hours. Many analysts have believed that any invasion was unlikely to start until after the Winter Olympics in China end on Feb. 20. The heightened U.S. rhetoric followed new intelligence that showed another increase in Russian troops near the Ukrainian border. “We can’t pinpoint the day at this point, and we can’t pinpoint the hour, but that is a very, very distinct possibility,” President Joe Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan said. The U.S. picked up intelligence that Russia is looking at Wednesday as a target date, according to a U.S. official familiar with the findings. The official, who was not authorized to speak publicly and did so only on condition of anonymity, would not say how definitive the intelligence was. U.S. officials said late Friday that the State Department planned to announce early Saturday that virtually American staff at the Kyiv embassy will be required to leave. A small number of officials may remain in Kyiv but the vast majority of the almost 200 Americans at the embassy will be sent out or relocated to Ukraine’s far west. The State Department would not comment. Those officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. In a demonstration of American commitment to NATO allies, the Pentagon is sending 3,000 more combat troops to Poland  to join 1,700 already assembling there, a senior U.S. defense official said Friday. The official provided the information under ground rules set by the Pentagon. The White House said Biden and Putin will discuss the crisis by phone on Saturday. Several NATO allies, including Britain, Norway and Denmark, are also asking their citizens to leave Ukraine. — Aamer Madhani, Nomaan Merchant, Matthew Lee, Lolita C. Baldor and Robert Burns in Washington PREPPING AND POSTURING In Romania’s Black Sea port of Constanta, the rumble of U.S. heavy military materiel was breaking the dawn quiet, signs that reinforcements and 1,000 more troops were coming into an airbase there. It was yet another indication that hardware was being beefed up around the strategic Black Sea where Russia, Ukraine and three NATO allies have bases. “From here in the Black Sea region, all the way to the Baltic, allies are stepping up to reinforce NATO’s presence at this critical time,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said from Constanta. Romania’s neighbor Bulgaria will also welcome Spanish jets to increase the potent presence of the alliance. In Black Sea waters, warships of Russia’s Baltic and Northern fleets arrived in Sevastopol Bay on the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014. The ships join several similar vessels that are part of Russia’s Black Sea fleet, augmenting its amphibious landing capability. Moscow has announced sweeping drills in the Black and Azov Seas in the coming days and closed large areas for commercial shipping, drawing a strong protest from Ukraine. Off Ukraine’s northern border, Russia and its ally Belarus are starting 10 days of war games, involving massive drills with live ammunition. “There is a risk for a full-fledged invasion,” warned Stoltenberg, but he added other threats were lurking too, “including attempts to topple the government in Kyiv.” TANKS TRUMP TALKS FOR NOW Despite the flurry of flights crisscrossing Europe to bring leaders together around the tables of diplomacy over the past weeks, the results have been far less spectacular as both sides continue to wait to see who will blink first over the issue. The only slightly positive news Friday seemed to come out of Moscow, where British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said he had had a “constructive, frank” discussion with Russian counterpart Sergei Shoigu. “I heard clearly from the Russian government that they had no intention of invading Ukraine,” Wallace told reporters in Moscow. He added: “We will judge that statement on the evidence.” Talks in Berlin between Ukraine and Russia, joined by France and Germany, at first held hope for some progress as they lasted into Friday morning, but at the end, nothing palpable emerged. “Unfortunately, almost nine hours of talks have ended without any significant results,” Russian deputy chief of staff Dmitry Kozak said. It remained unclear when and how the next attempt at a breakthrough would be made. A 2015 peace deal brokered by France and Germany in a similar so-called Normandy format helped halt large-scale battles in eastern Ukraine between government forces and Russia-backed rebels, but regular skirmishes have continued. The Kremlin has accused Kyiv of sabotaging the agreement, and Ukrainian officials argued in recent weeks that implementing it would hurt their country. Across the world in Melbourne, Australia, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was downbeat. “We’ve made every possible effort to engage Russia, to look at the concerns that it’s raised, to share concerns that we have, that European partners and allies have,” he said. But the gap with Moscow remains yawning. “Simply put, we continue to see very troubling signs of Russian escalation, including new forces arriving at the Ukrainian border. And as we said before, we’re in a window when an invasion could begin at any time,” Blinken said. Later Friday, Biden spoke to a number of European leaders to underscore the concerns raised by U.S. intelligence about the potential imminence of a Russian invasion. Sullivan said Western leaders were completely united and would respond harshly to a Russian invasion with devastating economic and trade sanctions.",western,1,1018,91.41,49.41,46.82,15.81,23.14,28.98,79.76,58.64,44.2,5.21,1.96,0.1,0.79,0,0.39,0.49,3.24,12.77,8.15,1.28,14.93,6.29,4.32,4.91,0.88,13.16,6.78,4.03,8.06,2.85,0.59,4.72,8.25,0.79,7.47,0.98,1.28,1.08,1.57,0.49,2.55,0,3.34,1.47,1.87,0.39,0.1,0.29,0.1,0.1,0,0,9.43,5.7,0.88,0.1,0.79,0.2,3.63,4.32,0,0.1,0,0.39,5.3,3.34,1.77,0.2,3.54,0.2,0.59,2.46,0.49,0.1,0.29,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.39,0.1,0.1,0,0,0.1,0,0.79,0,3.14,12.28,0.59,1.77,8.35,1.47,0.29,0.29,5.4,6.19,2.36,1.08,0,0,0,0,0,16.5,6.09,5.99,0,0,1.47,2.95
844,apnews.com,2022-02-14 08:00:00,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-olaf-scholz-moscow-vladimir-putin-europe-ddf76e8b58bfa88a1022fef99bbaf3be,German leader in Ukraine as fears of Russian invasion grow,English,United States,"MOSCOW (AP) — The Kremlin signaled Monday it is ready to keep talking with the West about security grievances that led to the current Ukraine crisis, offering hope that Russia might not invade its beleaguered neighbor within days as the U.S. and European allies increasingly fear. Questions remain about Russian President Vladimir Putin’s intentions, however. And countries are  evacuating diplomats and on alert for possible imminent war amid the worst East-West tensions since the Cold War. On a last-ditch diplomatic trip, Germany’s chancellor said there are “no sensible reasons” for the buildup of more than 130,000 Russian troops on Ukraine’s borders to the north, south and east, and he urged more dialogue. Britain’s prime minister said Europe is “on the edge of a precipice” — but added, “there is still time for President Putin to step back.” France’s foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, told French television that “all elements” were in place for a strong Russian offensive, but “nothing shows today” that Putin has decided to launch one. Despite warnings from Washington, London and elsewhere that Russian troops could move on Ukraine as soon as Wednesday, Monday’s meeting between Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov suggested otherwise. At the session with Putin, Lavrov argued that Moscow should hold more talks with the U.S. and its allies despite their refusal to consider Russia’s main security demands. Moscow, which denies it has any plans to invade Ukraine, wants Western guarantees that NATO won’t allow Ukraine and other former Soviet countries to join as members. It also wants the alliance to halt weapons deployments to Ukraine and roll back its forces from Eastern Europe — demands flatly rejected by the West. The talks “can’t go on indefinitely, but I would suggest to continue and expand them at this stage,” Lavrov said, noting that Washington has offered to conduct dialogue on limits for missile deployments in Europe, restrictions on military drills and other confidence-building measures. Lavrov said possibilities for talks “are far from being exhausted.” His comments, at an appearance orchestrated for TV cameras, seemed designed to send a message to the world about Putin’s own position: namely, that hopes for a diplomatic solution aren’t yet dead. Putin noted the West could try to draw Russia into “endless talks” and questioned whether there is still a chance to reach agreement. Lavrov replied that his ministry wouldn’t allow the U.S. and its allies to stonewall Russia’s main requests. The U.S. reacted coolly to Lavrov’s comments. “The path for diplomacy remains available if Russia chooses to engage constructively,” White House principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. “However, we are clear-eyed about the prospects of that, given the steps Russia is taking on the ground in plain sight.” U.S. officials said the Russian military continued apparent attack preparations along Ukraine’s borders. A U.S. defense official said small numbers of Russian ground units have been moving out of larger assembly areas for several days, taking up positions closer to the Ukrainian border at what would be departure points if Putin launched an invasion. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss information not publicly released. CBS News was first to report on the movement of the units. Satellite images taken over the last 48 hours show increased Russian military activity in Belarus, Crimea and western Russia, including the arrival of helicopters, ground-attack aircraft and fighter-bomber jets at forward locations. The photos also show ground forces leaving their garrisons and combat units moving into convoy formation, according to Maxar Technologies, a commercial satellite imagery company that has been monitoring the Russian buildup. Ukrainian security and defense council chief Oleksiy Danilov downplayed the threat of invasion but warned of the risk of “internal destabilization” by unspecified forces. “Today we do not see that a large-scale offensive by the Russian Federation can take place either on (Feb.) 16th or the 17th,” he told reporters after meeting lawmakers. “We are aware of the risks that exist in the territory of our country. But the situation is absolutely under control.” As if to show defiance, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday would be a “day of national unity,” calling on the country to display the blue-and-yellow flags and sing the national anthem in the face of “hybrid threats.” “Our country today is as strong as ever. It is not the first threat the strong Ukrainian people have faced,” Zelenskyy said Monday evening in a video address to the nation. “We’re calm. We’re strong. We’re together. A great nation in a great country.” The country is preparing nonetheless. Kyiv residents received letters from the mayor urging them “to defend your city,” and signs appeared in apartment buildings indicating the nearest bomb shelter. The mayor says the capital has about 4,500 such sites, including underground parking garages, subway stations and basements. Dr. Tamara Ugrich said she stocked up on grains and canned food, and prepared an emergency suitcase. “I don’t believe in war, but on TV the tension is growing every day and it’s getting harder and harder to keep calm. The more we are told not to panic, the more nervous people become,” she said. Others heeded the advice of Ukraine’s leaders not to panic. Street music flooded central Maidan Square on Sunday night and crowds danced. “I feel calm. You should always be ready for everything, and then you will have nothing to be afraid of,” said Alona Buznitskaya, a model. During what could be a crucial week for Europe’s security, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visited Ukraine on Monday before heading to Moscow for talks with Putin on a high-stakes diplomatic foray. After meeting Zelenskyy, Scholz urged Russia to show signs of de-escalation, and reiterated unspecified threats to Russia’s financial standing if it invades. “There are no sensible reasons for such a military deployment,” Scholz said. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres held talks with Lavrov and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and said in a statement that “abandoning diplomacy for confrontation is not a step over a line, it is a dive over a cliff.” U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday spoke by phone with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. According to a Downing Street statement, the two “agreed there remained a crucial window for diplomacy and for Russia to step back from its threats towards Ukraine.” The U.S. said it will close its embassy in Kyiv and move all remaining staff there to Lviv, a city near the Polish border. Lithuania moved diplomats’ families and some nonessential diplomatic workers out of the country as well. “It’s a big mistake that some embassies moved to western Ukraine,” Zelenskyy said. “It’s their decision, but ‘western Ukraine’ doesn’t exist. It’s united Ukraine. If something happens, God forbids, it (escalation) will be everywhere.” So far, NATO’s warnings have had little effect: Russia has only bolstered troops and weapons in the region and launched massive drills in its ally Belarus, which also neighbors Ukraine. The West fears that the drills, which run through Sunday, could be used by Moscow as a cover for an invasion from the north. One possible off-ramp emerged this week: Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.K., Vadym Prystaiko, pointed at a possibility of Ukraine shelving its NATO bid — an objective that is written into its constitution — if it would avert war with Russia. “We might — especially being threatened like that, blackmailed by that, and pushed to it,” Prystaiko told BBC Radio 5. On Monday, Prystaiko appeared to back away from the idea, but the fact that it was raised at all suggests it is being discussed behind closed doors. Pressed over Ukraine’s NATO ambitions Monday, the Ukrainian president remained vague, referring to them as a “dream.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia would welcome such a move. ___ Karmanau reported from Kyiv, Ukraine.

Australian Barty, 25, reached the third round by beating Italian qualifier Lucia Bronzetti 6-1 6-1 on Wednesday. Defending champion Naomi Osaka also looked set for a win inside an hour against American Madison Brengle. Japan's Osaka won the first set in 20 minutes but lost her way in the second before securing a 6-0 6-4 victory. Barty will face Italian 30th seed Camila Giorgi next, while Osaka faces exciting American teenager Amanda Anisimova. Anisimova beat Olympic gold medallist Belinda Bencic 6-2 7-5 and has yet to lose a match this season. As she aims to become the first home champion since 1978, Barty says trying to avoid coronavirus as rates rise in Melbourne has not affected her. ""For us, it's pretty low-key anyway,"" she said. ""We come and practice and do what we need to do. Otherwise a good book and a coffee and I'm set."" The two-time Grand Slam champion has not dropped a game on her serve at Melbourne Park this week, beating Bronzetti in 52 minutes to back-up another emphatic win in the first round. On Monday, the 2021 Wimbledon champion dropped one game as she thrashed Ukraine's Lesia Tsurenko in 54 minutes. Barty has started the 2022 season by winning all six of her matches, having lifted the Adelaide International title last week. On the strength of her service game, she said: ""I'm continually trying to make it a weapon. ""I'm not the biggest girl out there, but I know I've got a sound technique and I know if I can get my rhythm right and use it effectively, it can be a weapon. ""As a kid, I was always serving baskets and baskets of serves to try to create that weapon, try to create a really sound shot."" Few players in the women's game - if anyone - are better than 24-year-old Osaka when she executes the power and precision which has led to four Grand Slam titles. Those fans inside Melbourne Park for Wednesday's night session witnessed some fine ball-striking in the first set, which left Britain's Andy Murray impressed as he watched on the television. After cruising through the first set, Osaka briefly lost her way midway in the second. Brengle finally got on the scoreboard - drawing great applause from Rod Laver Arena - before further stalling the two-time Melbourne champion. Mounting frustration peaked for Osaka after she whacked a smash long to let Brengle break for 4-3, only for the 13th seed to instantly hit back. Then she rediscovered a better level in the final couple of games to wrap victory in one hour and five minutes. ""I returned pretty well, that's not my usual stat but I've been really working on that in the off season,"" said Osaka, who took a four-month break at the end of last season. ""I'm trying not to rate my level, if I compare myself to the past I will never be satisfied. I'm trying to take it one day at a time. Ukrainian 15th seed Elina Svitolina said it was ""sad"" to see her opponent Harmony Tan helped off court in a wheelchair during their second-round match. France's Tan had fought back to take Svitolina to a deciding set before injuring her left calf. She was trailing 6-3 5-7 5-1 when she attempted to serve out the final game of the match but was advised by the umpire to stop. ""It was a rollercoaster match,"" Svitolina said. ""It's very sad to see her leaving the court in a wheelchair. ""It's never, never good to see a player getting injured."" Svitolina, long tipped as a future Grand Slam champion, will face two-time Australian Open winner Victoria Azarenka next after the Belarusian swept past Switzerland's Jil Teichmann 6-1 6-2. Spanish eighth seed Paula Badosa saw off Italy's Martina Trevisan 6-0 6-3, while Madison Keys kept up her early season form with a 6-2 7-5 victory over Romania's Jaqueline Cristian. Greek fifth seed Maria Sakkari saw off China's Zheng Qinwen 6-1 6-4 and French Open champion Barbora Krejcikova prevailed 6-2 6-3 over Xiyu Wang to set up a meeting with Jelena Ostapenko. Ostapenko, who won Roland Garros in 2017, hit back to beat Alison Riske 4-6 6-2 6-4, while China's Wang Qiang battled to a 2-6 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 win over Alison van Uytvanck.",western,1,734,87.32,32.4,45.09,65.33,20.97,20.57,78.61,57.49,43.19,8.86,6.13,2.45,0.41,0,2.86,0.14,2.72,13.49,7.63,7.77,13.9,4.77,2.86,5.45,1.09,13.35,5.99,4.9,6.81,0.68,4.77,2.72,6.54,0.68,5.86,0.41,0.68,1.36,0.95,0.27,2.59,0,6.68,4.77,1.91,0.95,0.54,0.41,0,0.14,0.27,0,6.54,2.18,0.41,0,0.41,0,1.36,4.36,0,0,3,0.14,1.63,0,1.5,0.14,3.27,2.04,0.14,1.09,0,0,1.09,0.41,0.14,0,0,0,0,0.14,0,0.14,0,0.95,0,0.14,0,0.95,0.54,0.27,5.18,9.81,0.14,1.77,7.08,0.95,0.68,0,7.36,5.59,2.72,0.54,0,0,0,0,0,20.44,4.77,3.95,0,0,3,8.72
205,bbc.co.uk,2022-02-08 08:00:00,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60299790,Ukraine crisis : Macron says Putin pledges no new Ukraine escalation,English,United Kingdom,"French President Emmanuel Macron has told reporters that President Vladimir Putin assured him that Russian forces would not ramp up the crisis near Ukraine's borders. ""I secured an assurance there would be no deterioration or escalation,"" he said before meeting Ukraine's leader. However, Russia said any suggestion of a guarantee was ""not right"". Russia has denied any plans to invade Ukraine, but it has assembled more than 100,000 troops near its borders. US officials believe Russia has assembled 70% of military forces needed for a full-scale invasion. The tensions between Russia, Ukraine and the West come nearly eight years after Russia annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula. Moscow accuses the Ukrainian government of failing to implement the Minsk agreement - an international deal sponsored by Germany and France to restore peace to the east, where Russian-backed rebels control swathes of territory and at least 14,000 people have been killed since 2014. President Macron this week is on a diplomatic tour of national capitals. He arrived in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Tuesday after almost six hours of talks with Mr Putin in Moscow on Monday. At a news conference with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, Mr Macron said there was now the chance to ""make these negotiations move forward"" between Russia and Ukraine, and that he could see ""concrete solutions"" to reducing tensions. Mr Zelensky meanwhile called on Mr Putin to take serious measures to reduce tensions. ""I do not really trust words, I believe that every politician can be transparent by taking concrete steps,"" he said. Mr Macron then flew to Berlin, where he joined the leaders of Germany and Poland in expressing their joint support for Ukrainian sovereignty. The leaders met as part of a summit of the Weimar Triangle group, formed 31 years ago after the end of the Cold War, to help deal with challenges now facing Europe. Mr Putin hinted on Monday that some of Mr Macron's proposals ""could form the basis of further joint steps"" - although they were ""probably still too early to talk about"". A French official later told reporters that the two leaders had agreed that Russia would pull troops out of Belarus at the end of exercises taking place near Ukraine's northern borders. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov however denied any deal had occurred - although the troops were expected to return to Russia at some point, he said. President Macron's diplomatic push later moved to Berlin for a meeting with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and Polish President Andrzej Duda. 'It's like they stuck a knife in our back': Ukraine has been living with war for the past eight years US President Joe Biden met the German leader in Washington on Monday and threatened to shut down a key Russian gas pipeline to Germany, called Nord Stream 2, if Moscow invaded Ukraine. Chancellor Scholz - on his first trip to Washington since becoming chancellor and facing criticism for his response to the Ukraine crisis - was however more ambiguous about the pipeline than Mr Biden. Western countries have already rejected a number of Moscow's demands, including that the Nato defence alliance rule out Ukraine becoming a member, and that it reduce its military presence in eastern Europe. By Paul Adams, BBC diplomatic correspondent The Ukrainian president absolutely doesn't trust Mr Putin. ""Openness in a leader is fine"", he responded when Mr Macron talked about his frank discussions with the Russian leader. ""But only if it's not a game."" Mr Zelensky welcomed Emmanuel Macron's support and said the two men had a ""common vision"" regarding the challenges facing Ukraine, Europe and the world. But there were awkward moments. Mr Macron had to deny he'd cited Finland as a possible model for Ukraine's relationship with Nato (close, but not a member). Mr Zelensky appeared to make light of it but didn't sound impressed. Mr Putin says he wants to invigorate the 2014 Minsk Agreement, and this is also a challenge for Mr Zelensky. Signed by his predecessor, in the middle of the war, he fears - as do most Ukrainians - that implementing Minsk in its current form will serve to enhance the authority of the pro-Russia separatists who currently control parts of the Donbas. Mr Zelensky is basking in a growing measure of international support. Foreign dignitaries are coming in and out of town in a way that Kyiv has rarely seen. This crisis has yet to ease, but seems marginally less acute. By Caroline Davies, BBC Moscow correspondent In the words of the Kremlin, President Macron may have arrived in Moscow with some ""seeds of reason"", but they haven't yet flowered into an agreement. Russia is keeping its powder dry, calling the talks long but informative. Any suggestion that France had secured a deal were also quickly slapped down; Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said that it would be impossible for Moscow and Paris to do a deal as France is not the leader of Nato. Russia's main focus, it seems, is still on the US. Crucially, Russia has yet again emphasised that it feels its security concerns around potential Nato expansion have not been answered.

U.S. officials said the United States is preparing to evacuate its embassy in Kyiv, and Americans in Ukraine are being told to leave within the next 48 hours. Adding to the sense of crisis, the Pentagon ordered an additional 3,000 U.S. troops to Poland to reassure allies. As diplomatic options for averting war in Ukraine appeared to narrow, the White House said President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin would discuss the crisis by phone on Saturday. Biden has said the U.S. military will not enter a war in Ukraine, but he has promised severe economic sanctions against Moscow, in concert with international allies. Timing of possible Russian military action remains a key question. The U.S. picked up intelligence that Russia is looking at Wednesday as a target date, according to a U.S. official familiar with the findings. The official, who was not authorized to speak publicly and did so only on condition of anonymity, would not say how definitive the intelligence was, and the White House publicly underscored that the U.S. does not know with certainty whether Putin is committed to invasion. However, U.S. officials said anew that Russia’s buildup of offensive air, land and sea firepower near Ukraine has reached the point where it could invade on short notice. U.S. officials told The Associated Press late Friday that the State Department plans to announce early Saturday that virtually all American staff at the Kyiv embassy will be required to leave. The State Department would not comment. The department had earlier ordered families of U.S. embassy staffers in Kyiv to leave. But it had left it to the discretion of nonessential personnel if they wanted to depart. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, said a small number of officials may remain in Kyiv but the vast majority of the almost 200 Americans will be sent out or relocated to Ukraine’s far west, near the Polish border, so the U.S. can retain a diplomatic presence in the country. Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, urged all Americans in Ukraine to leave, emphasizing that they should not expect the U.S. military to rescue them in the event that air and rail transportation is severed after a Russian invasion. Several NATO allies including Britain, Canada, Norway and Denmark also are asking their citizens to leave Ukraine, as is non-NATO ally New Zealand. Sullivan said Russian military action could start with missile and air attacks, followed by a ground offensive. “Yes, it is an urgent message because we are in an urgent situation,” he told reporters at the White House. “Russia has all the forces it needs to conduct a major military action,” Sullivan said, adding, “Russia could choose, in very short order, to commence a major military action against Ukraine.” He said the scale of such an invasion could range from a limited incursion to a strike on Kyiv, the capital. Russia scoffed at the U.S. talk of urgency. “The hysteria of the White House is more indicative than ever,” said Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova. “The Anglo-Saxons need a war. At any cost. Provocations, misinformation and threats are a favorite method of solving their own problems.” In addition to the more than 100,000 ground troops that U.S. officials say Russia has assembled along Ukraine’s eastern and southern borders, the Russians have deployed missile, air, naval and special operations forces, as well as supplies to sustain a war. This week Russia moved six amphibious assault ships into the Black Sea, augmenting its capability to land marines on the coast. Sullivan’s stark warning accelerated the projected timeframe for a potential invasion, which many analysts have believed was unlikely until after the Winter Olympics in China end  on Feb. 20. Sullivan said the combination of a further Russian troop buildup on Ukraine’s borders and unspecified intelligence indicators have prompted the administration to warn that war could begin any time. “We can’t pinpoint the day at this point, and we can’t pinpoint the hour, but that is a very, very distinct possibility,” Sullivan said. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin conferred by phone with several of his NATO counterparts. Echoing Sullivan’s public remarks, Austin told them a Russian invasion of Ukraine “could begin at any time,” Kirby said. Biden has said U.S. troops will not enter Ukraine to contest any Russian invasion, but he has bolstered the U.S. military presence in Europe as reassurance to allies on NATO’s eastern flank. On Friday the Pentagon said Biden ordered a further 3,000 soldiers to Poland, on top of 1,700 who are on their way there. Together they form an infantry brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division. The U.S. Army also is shifting 1,000 soldiers from Germany to Romania, which like Poland shares a border with Ukraine. Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke by phone Friday with his Russian counterpart, Gen. Valery Gerasimov. Milley’s office provided no details beyond saying the two men discussed “several security-related issues of concern.” Milley also had phone calls with several of his counterparts from NATO countries, including Canada, France, Germany, Britain, Italy, Poland and Romania. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who was traveling in Australia, was the first senior U.S. official to say publicly that an invasion could come before the end of the Olympics. Sullivan would not discuss the intelligence details behind the U.S. assessment and denied a report that American officials believe Putin has made the decision to invade. But he said U.S. officials believe there is “a strong possibility” of an invasion. “We believe he very well may give the final go order,” Sullivan said. “It may well happen soon.” Biden spoke to a number of European leaders on Friday to underscore the concerns raised by U.S. intelligence about the potential imminence of a Russian invasion. Sullivan said the Western leaders were completely united and would respond harshly to a Russian invasion with devastating economic and trade sanctions. Britain’s defense secretary, Ben Wallace, visited Moscow a day after British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss held frosty talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and urged him to pull back Russia’s troops near Ukraine. Lavrov characterized that meeting as a “conversation between deaf and dumb.” Russia opened massive war games in Belarus on Thursday that are due to run through next weekend but says it has no plans to invade Ukraine. The Russians are insisting that the West keep Ukraine and other former Soviet countries out of NATO. It also wants NATO to refrain from deploying weapons near its border and to roll back alliance forces from Eastern Europe — demands flatly rejected by the West. Speaking at the start of his talks with Britain’s Wallace, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said “the military-political situation in Europe is growing increasingly tense, and it’s not our fault.” Shoigu said shipments of weapons to Ukraine by the U.S., Britain and other allies have contributed to the tensions and pointed to the recent deployment of British soldiers to Ukraine, asking why they were sent and how long they would stay. Speaking to reporters after the talks, Wallace said the anti-tank missiles that Britain sent to Ukraine were defensive tactical weapons that do not pose a threat to any neighbor unless it invades. He described the talks as “constructive and frank” and noted his Russian counterpart’s assurances that Moscow has no intention to attack Ukraine. But he also emphasized that the concentration of Russian troops near Ukrainian territory is clearly “beyond normal exercising.” Russia’s troop concentration includes forces deployed on the territory of its ally Belarus for massive joint drills involving firing live ammunition. Those exercises entered a decisive phase Thursday and will run through Feb. 20. The Ukrainian capital is about 75 kilometers (47 miles) south of the Belarus border. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg visited a military base in Romania, hailing the deployment of additional U.S. troops as “a powerful demonstration of trans-Atlantic unity.” Separately, the U.S. Agency for International Development notified Congress on Friday of a new $73 million aid package to Georgia, another former Soviet republic that has faced aggression from Moscow and fought a war with Russia in 2008. The assistance includes almost $46 million in money to help Georgia combat “transnational threats and crime,” notably to “decrease dependence on Russia,” according to the congressional notification that was obtained by the AP. Russia and Ukraine have been locked in a bitter conflict since 2014, when Ukraine’s Kremlin-friendly leader was driven from office by a popular uprising. Moscow responded by annexing Crimea and then backing a separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine, where fighting has killed over 14,000 people. A 2015 peace deal brokered by France and Germany helped halt large-scale battles, but regular skirmishes have continued, and efforts to reach a political settlement have stalled. ___ Isachenkov reported from Moscow.

Irek Dorozanski/DWOT/Handout via REUTERS HAJNOWKA, Poland, Nov 14 (Reuters) - NATO must take ""concrete steps"" to resolve the migrant crisis on the Belarus border, the Polish prime minister was quoted as saying on Sunday, adding that Poland, Lithuania and Latvia may ask for consultations under the alliance's treaty. Thousands of migrants have travelled to Belarus in the hope of crossing into the European Union (EU), only to find themselves trapped on the border in freezing conditions. The EU accuses Minsk of orchestrating the crisis to put pressure on the bloc over sanctions, but Belarus has repeatedly denied this. Some countries in the region have warned the stand-off could escalate into a military conflict. ""It is not enough just for us to publicly express our concern - now we need concrete steps and the commitment of the entire alliance,"" Mateusz Morawiecki told Polish state-run news agency PAP. Under Article 4 of the NATO treaty, any ally can request consultations whenever, in the opinion of any of them, their territorial integrity, political independence or security is threatened. Russian President Vladimir Putin, a key backer of Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko, said that Russia was ready to help resolve the crisis, RIA news agency reported on Sunday, citing an interview on a state TV channel.  read more Morawiecki told PAP that EU leaders would discuss further sanctions against Belarus, including completely closing the border. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell was quoted as saying that the bloc will widen sanctions on Belarus on Monday to include airlines and travel agencies thought to be involved in transporting migrants. Morawiecki said that the EU should jointly finance a border wall. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau on Saturday and said Belarus' actions threaten regional security and distract from Russian military activities on the Ukraine border, State Department spokesman Ned Price said. ""Secretary Blinken reaffirmed U.S. support for Poland in the face of the Lukashenka regime’s cynical exploitation of vulnerable migrants,"" Price said in a statement on Sunday. Meanwhile, Polish forces described an increasingly tense situation on the frontier, with the Border Guard saying migrants were receiving instructions and equipment from Belarusian guards and it expected another ""big attempt"" to break through. ""Huge logs of wood are being brought in, probably to lower the fence,"" Border Guard spokeswoman Katarzyna Zdanowicz told private broadcaster TVN24. Belarusian blogging service NEXTA shared a video of what it said was a large column of migrants walking towards the frontier. Footage posted on Twitter by the Polish Interior Ministry showed what appeared to be a water cannon deployed at the border, as a recorded message warned migrants that force could be used against them if they did not follow orders. NGO Grupa Granica said in a statement it had received information about attempts by Belarus to force migrants to use violence against Polish officers. ""Due to the risk of escalation of violence we want to remind all parties that migrants are not aggressors but hostages of Lukashenko's regime,"" it wrote. The Belarusian State Border Guard Committee spokesperson Anton Bychkovsky said the accusations were disinformation. ""It does not correspond with the reality,"" he said On Saturday, a group of about 50 migrants broke through defences on the border and entered Poland near the village of Starzyna, police said on Sunday. The Border Guard told PAP they were all caught. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

219,apnews.com,2021-11-30 08:00:00,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-germany-migration-europe-ab1efae5e65bf01af3be2f6139ef6f4b,President of Belarus offers to host Russian nuclear weapons,English,United States,"MOSCOW (AP) — The longtime president of Belarus said Tuesday that his country would be ready to host Russian nuclear weapons if NATO moves U.S. atomic bombs from Germany to Eastern Europe. In an interview, President Alexander Lukashenko also said for the first time that he recognizes the Crimean Peninsula as part of Russia and plans to visit it soon. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, a move that the West regards as illegal. Lukashenko made the remarks as he moves to cement ties with Russia, his main ally and sponsor, amid tensions with the West over his disputed reelection last year and his government’s brutal crackdown on dissent in Belarus. Asked about the possible redeployment of U.S. atomic bombs to Eastern Europe if Germany’s new government were no longer willing to house the weapons, Lukashenko responded that he would invite Russian President Vladimir Putin to send nuclear weapons that were withdrawn after the 1991 Soviet collapse back to Belarus. “I would offer Putin to return nuclear weapons to Belarus,” Lukashenko said in the interview with Dmitry Kiselyov, the head of Russian state media group Rossiya Segodnya. The Belarusian leader wouldn’t elaborate on what kind of weapons Belarus would be willing to accommodate. He added that Belarus has carefully preserved the necessary military infrastructure dating back to the Soviet era. Opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who left Belarus under pressure after unsuccessfully trying to unseat Lukashenko in last year’s election, denounced the president’s comments. “Such a person shouldn’t be trusted to handle matches, let alone nuclear weapons,” she told The Associated Press. Tsikhanouskaya said the deployment of Russian nuclear weapons to Belarus would violate international arms agreements and the will of Belarus’ people. “The majority of Belarusians have spoken for Belarus’ neutrality,” she said. Speaking earlier this month, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the Western military alliance would need to ponder redeploying nuclear weapons east if the new German government changes the country’s policy on nuclear sharing. “Germany can, of course, decide whether there will be nuclear weapons in your country, but the alternative is that we easily end up with nuclear weapons in other countries in Europe, also to the east of Germany,” Stoltenberg said. Alexei Arbatov, a Moscow-based foreign policy expert, described the possible redeployment of U.S. atomic bombs to Eastern Europe as a “mad, adventurist move.” If Moscow responds by sending its nuclear weapons to Belarus, “the situation would be more dangerous than it was during the Cold War times,” the Interfax news agency quoted Arbatov as saying. Lukashenko has edged closer to Russia since he faced Western pressure after being awarded a sixth term in an August 2020 vote that the opposition and the West say was rigged. Belarusian authorities responded to protests triggered by the election with a sweeping crackdown, prompting the European Union and the United States to slap Belarus with several rounds of sanctions. Tensions have escalated further since the summer over the arrival of thousands of migrants and refugees on Belarus’ border with EU member Poland. The EU has accused Lukashenko of retaliating for its sanctions by using desperate asylum-seekers as pawns and tricking them into trying to enter Poland, Lithuania and Latvia to destabilize the entire EU. Russia and Belarus have a union agreement that envisages close political, economic and military ties, but Lukashenko in the past has sought to maneuver between Moscow and the West, trying to win concessions from each party. And even though he relied on cheap energy and loans provided by Russia, he refrained from recognizing Moscow’s annexation of Crimea until Tuesday. In Tuesday’s interview, he said he considers Crimea part of Russia both de facto and de jure. Lukashenko added that he planned to visit Crimea on Putin’s invitation. “If the president comes there with the president of Russia, what other form of recognition could there be?” he said. Ukrainian and Western authorities have raised concern in recent days about alleged Kremlin plans to invade Ukraine. Lukashenko warned that his country would stand squarely behind Russia if the Ukrainian government launched an offensive against Moscow-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine. Belarusian political analyst Valery Karbalevich said Lukashenko’s statement came as a payoff for Moscow’s backing. “Lukashenko effectively pays Putin for the support that the Kremlin has offered to him at the time when he was on the verge of political death after the election,” Karbalevich told the AP. “Lukashenko has become a tool for the Kremlin and he expects more Russian subsidies and financial aid in return.” He noted that in the face of Western sanctions against the Belarusian economy, Lukashenko is now “ready to deploy nuclear weapons, stage a crisis with migrants and get involved in a confrontation with Ukraine.” __ Yuras Karmanau in Kyiv, Ukraine contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Belarus at https://apnews.com/hub/belarus",western,1,805,95.59,54.15,13.04,7.79,23.68,32.67,76.4,55.53,41.49,5.96,3.35,0.12,0.12,0.12,2.73,0.12,2.61,12.42,8.07,0.75,16.4,4.72,1.61,5.84,0.37,10.19,7.83,2.48,8.2,1.12,1.37,5.84,8.07,0.12,7.7,1.24,1.24,1.99,1.12,0.25,2.36,0,3.85,1.24,2.61,0.62,0,0.62,0,0.37,0,0,12.05,6.83,1.12,0.12,1.24,0.25,3.48,4.97,0,0.12,0.25,2.61,7.95,4.47,1.99,1.49,2.61,0.12,0.25,1.24,0.99,0,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.12,0.5,0,0.12,0,0,0,0.37,0.37,0,2.48,9.32,0.25,1.61,7.45,0,0,0.37,3.85,3.98,1.61,1.37,0.12,0.12,0,0,0,15.4,4.84,4.35,0.12,0,1.99,4.1
803,apnews.com,2022-02-11 08:00:00,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-eastern-europe-vladimir-putin-moscow-russia-13ed11c9df111d132c51312bab270b24,"EXPLAINER : Putin Ukraine strategy mixes threats , diplomacy",English,United States,"MOSCOW (AP) — With Russia carrying out a massive military buildup near Ukraine and the West roundly rejecting Moscow’s security demands, a window for diplomacy in the crisis appears to be closing. But even as Moscow continues to bolster its forces and holds sweeping war games, President Vladimir Putin is keeping the window open for more negotiations in a calculated game of brinkmanship intended to persuade Washington and its allies to accept Russia’s demands. The West fears that a Russian invasion of Ukraine may be imminent, while Russia maintains it has no plans to do so but wants its security concerns addressed. Here is a look at the Kremlin’s strategy in the standoff: DEMANDS AND RESPONSES Russia wants the U.S. and its allies to keep Ukraine and other former Soviet nations from joining NATO, refrain from putting any weapons near Russia, and roll back alliance forces from Eastern Europe. Washington and NATO reject those demands as “nonstarters,” but they also are offering to discuss possible limits on missile deployments, a greater transparency of military drills and other confidence-building measures. Putin has yet to deliver Moscow’s formal response to the Western proposals, but he has already described them as secondary and warned that he wouldn’t take “no” for an answer on his main demands. He countered the Western argument about NATO having an open-door policy by arguing that it threatens Russia and violates the principle of the “indivisibility of security” enshrined in international agreements. MILITARY MUSCLE-FLEXING With the West rejecting its key demands, the Kremlin has raised the stakes by massing over 100,000 troops near Ukraine and carrying out a series of military maneuvers from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea. As part of the show of force, Moscow has moved trainloads of troops, tanks and weapons from the Far East and Siberia to Belarus for joint war games, drawing Western concerns that Russia could use them as a cover for an invasion. Washington and its allies are raising the prospect of unprecedented sanctions in the event of an invasion, including a possible ban on dollar transactions, draconian restrictions on key technology imports like microchips, and the shutdown of a newly built Russian gas pipeline to Germany. President Joe Biden’s administration also has deployed additional U.S. troops to Poland, Romania and Germany in a show of Washington’s commitment to protect NATO’s eastern flank. The U.S. and its allies have delivered planeloads of weapons and munitions to Ukraine. CALCULATED ESCALATION By concentrating troops that could attack Ukraine from many directions, Putin has demonstrated a readiness to escalate the crisis to achieve his goals. “Putin appears overconfident and is exhibiting a high level of risk-tolerance,” said Ben Hodges, who served as commanding general of the U.S. Army Europe and now works at the Center for European Policy Analysis. “He seems intent on applying maximum pressure on the West in this self-manufactured crisis, in hopes that Ukraine or NATO will eventually make concessions.” Some observers expect Putin to further ratchet up tensions by expanding the scope and area of the military drills. Fyodor Lukyanov, head of the Moscow-based Council for Foreign and Defense Policies who closely follows the Kremlin’s thinking, predicted a Western refusal to discuss Russia’s main demands would trigger a new round of escalation. “Logically, Russia will need to raise the level of tensions,” Lukyanov said. “If the goals set are not being achieved, then you need to increase pressure -- first of all through a demonstration of force.” Lukyanov said that while invading Ukraine is not what Putin wants, he may challenge the West by other means. “The whole idea as envisaged by Putin ... was not to solve the Ukrainian crisis by means of war, but to bring the West to the negotiations table about principles of European security arrangements,” Lukyanov noted. “The moment Russia starts a war against Ukraine, the whole previous game will be over and the new game will happen at an absolutely different level of risk. And all we know about Mr. Putin is that he is not a gambler. He is a calculated player.” POTENTIAL PATHS FOR COMPROMISE While Putin and his officials have insisted they expect the U.S. and NATO to bow to Russia’s demands — a prospect that looks all but impossible — some Kremlin-watchers expect Moscow to eventually accept a compromise that would help avoid hostilities and allow all sides to save face. Even though Western allies won’t renounce NATO’s open-door policy, they have no intention to embrace Ukraine or any other ex-Soviet nation anytime soon. Some analysts floated an idea of a potential moratorium on expanding the alliance. Gwendolyn Sasse, a Carnegie Europe fellow who heads the Centre for East European and International Studies in Berlin, voiced skepticism, saying that “the worst would be to signal that there are divisions in NATO,” noting that Putin might not be satisfied with it either. Another possibility is the “Finlandization” of Ukraine, meaning that the country would acquire a neutral status, the way Finland did after World War II. The policy helped it maintain friendly ties with the Soviet Union throughout the Cold War. Such a move would represent a sharp revision of Kyiv’s course toward NATO membership and likely fuel strong domestic criticism, but the Ukrainian public could eventually welcome the policy twist as a lesser evil, compared with a Russian invasion. Asked about the “Finlandization” idea, French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters Monday that “this is one of the models on the table,” but he backtracked the next day when he visited Kyiv. Another potential compromise would likely include steps to defuse tensions in eastern Ukraine, which has been controlled by Russia-backed separatists since a rebellion flared up there in 2014 shortly after Moscow’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula. Russia has urged the West to press Ukraine to fulfill its obligations under a  2015 peace deal  that was brokered by France and Germany and required Kyiv to offer self-rule to the rebel-held territories. The deal has been seen by Ukrainians as a betrayal of the country’s national interests and its implementation has stalled. Macron this week described the agreement as “the only path allowing to build peace ... and find a sustainable political solution.” ___ Associated Press writers Lorne Cook in Brussels and Sylvie Corbet in Paris contributed.",western,1,1040,93.25,40.06,21.89,12.23,26.67,30.38,79.9,56.73,45.29,5.67,2.12,0,0.1,0.1,1.15,0.48,3.56,15,9.62,0.48,14.9,5.58,2.5,6.63,0.96,10.1,7.02,2.79,8.65,2.12,1.25,5.38,11.54,0.87,10.67,1.92,1.73,1.63,2.21,0.1,3.08,0,5.19,2.21,2.98,0.67,0.19,0.48,0.1,0.29,0,0,9.04,5.77,1.35,0.19,1.15,0.29,2.02,3.85,0,0,0,1.25,3.85,2.6,1.06,0.19,2.6,0.48,0.29,1.35,0.38,0.19,0.48,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1,0,0.67,0.38,0.58,0,0.19,0,0.19,1.44,0.1,2.5,10.29,0.29,1.35,7.4,0.87,0,0.38,2.88,2.02,3.85,2.69,0.1,0,0.1,0,0,15.48,5.19,4.04,0,0,1.63,4.62

S . says  all option on the table over Russian troop buildup near Ukraine,English,United States,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Humeyra Pamuk, Simon Lewis 4 Min Read WASHINGTON (Reuters) - All options are on the table in how to respond to Russia’s “large and unusual” troop buildup near Ukraine’s border, and the NATO alliance will decide on the next move following consultations next week, the State Department’s top U.S. diplomat for European affairs said on Friday. “As you can appreciate, all options are on the table and there’s a toolkit that includes a whole range of options,” Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Karen Donfried told reporters in a telephone briefing. U.S. President Joe Biden said he was concerned about the situation in Ukraine, repeated Washington’s support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity and added that he will “in all probability” speak with his Ukrainian and Russian counterparts Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Vladimir Putin. The comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is heading to Latvia and Sweden next week to attend meetings of NATO and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Donfried said Moscow’s “large and unusual” troop buildup would top the agenda at the NATO summit. “It’s now for the alliance to decide what are the next moves that NATO wants to take,” Donfried said. “Next week, we will talk about our assessment of what’s happening on Russia’s border with Ukraine and we will begin that conversation of what are the options that are on the table and what it is that NATO as an alliance would like to do together,” she said. U.S., NATO and Ukrainian officials have raised the alarm in recent weeks over what they say are unusual Russian troop movements closer to Ukraine, suggesting that Moscow may be poised to launch an attack on its neighbor, accusations Russia has rejected as fear-mongering. Asked if Blinken was going to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov while in Stockholm, Donfried said she had no such announcements to make but added: “Stay tuned.” On Friday, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Ukraine’s head of presidential administration, Andriy Yermak, in a call spoke about their concerns over Russian military activities near Ukraine’s border. The two discussed Russia’s “harsh rhetoric” toward Ukraine and agreed all sides should pursue diplomatic efforts to ease tensions, National Security Council spokesperson Emily Horne said in a statement. “Mr. Sullivan underscored the United States’ unwavering commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Horne said. The head of Ukraine’s military intelligence told the Military Times outlet this weekend that Russia had more than 92,000 troops massed around Ukraine’s borders and was preparing for an attack by the end of January or beginning of February. Moscow has dismissed such suggestions as inflammatory and said it was not threatening anyone and defended its right to deploy its troops as it wished. Donfried was asked what the United States saw specifically different in Russia’s troop buildup this time, but she did not elaborate aside from saying it was “large and unusual.” Russia’s intentions remain unclear, and East-West tensions are running high with Ukraine, Russia and NATO all conducting military drills and Moscow accusing Washington of rehearsing a nuclear attack on Russia earlier this month. Asked if recent escalation has prompted Washington to consider more seriously deploying permanent troops in NATO’s eastern flank, Donfried did not elaborate on the specific point but said NATO foreign ministers next week would be discussing the wider strategy for the alliance’s posturing in the 21st century. At the OSCE meeting in Stockholm, Donfried said, Blinken will also raise Russia’s occupation of Ukrainian and Georgian territories, the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh and the crisis in Belarus.

None of these are legit, even though they were shared widely on social media. The Associated Press checked them out. Here are the facts: ___ Paris police didn’t give fines for waving flag, saying ‘freedom’ CLAIM: Police in Paris ticketed protesters for carrying the French flag and saying the word “freedom.” THE FACTS: Paris police ticketed protesters for offenses related to “participating in a prohibited protest,” not for carrying the French flag or saying the word “freedom,” as some people falsely claimed online. Following demonstrations in the French capital last weekend against COVID-19 mandates — inspired by rallies among truckers and others in Canada — one popular post asserted that Paris police were issuing tickets with fines of up to 135 euros ($153) for actions such as holding the flag and shouting “liberté.” “Tanks and tear-gas in France, with €135 fee for those holding a french flag and €90 to those who dare utter the word “freedom”, while protesting in Paris is now made illegal,” one tweet said. While some people on social media said they took the post to be a metaphor, others believed that people were actually being ticketed for these actions. But Paris police officials said in a statement issued to The Associated Press that tickets handed out to protesters were for participating in the rally despite a police order that prohibited involvement, a police spokesperson confirmed. Police gave out two tiers of driving tickets for fines of 135 and 90 euros ($102) for infractions that related to driving on a temporarily closed road and for attending a prohibited protest, according to information from the Paris police, checked against a ledger of fine amounts from the National Agency for the Automated Processing of Offenses by the AP. Police set up checkpoints into the French capital on key roads last weekend and said they successfully stopped at least 500 vehicles from heading to the banned protest, which, like in Canada, aimed to blockade roads and use vehicles to create a convoy. Still, a few dozen vehicles were able to slip into Paris and disrupt traffic. Authorities fired tear gas as they demanded that the demonstrators disperse, some of whom climbed onto their vehicles to create chaos, the AP reported. In Canada, similar demonstrations have unfolded over the past several weeks in and around the capital city of Ottawa among truckers and others angry over Canada’s COVID-19 restrictions. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invoked emergency powers Monday to quell the protests. — Associated Press writer Sophia Tulp in Atlanta and Beatrice Dupuy in New York contributed this report. ___ Posts distort research details to suggest secret vaccine campaign CLAIM: Johns Hopkins University research shows that someone can “be vaccinated with a PCR swab test without knowing.” THE FACTS: Researchers have developed tiny devices for potentially delivering drugs, but the technology hasn’t been tested or used with vaccines — or delivered through PCR swab tests. Social media posts baselessly linked the technology developed by Johns Hopkins researchers to a method of stealthily administering vaccines to unknowing recipients. “Johns Hopkins U Confirms You Can Be Vaccinated with a PCR Swab Test Without Knowing,” reads one blog post’s headline shared on Facebook and Instagram. But the university confirmed no such thing. The blog post points to a November 2020 article by the university announcing that researchers had “designed tiny, star-shaped microdevices that can latch onto intestinal mucosa and release drugs into the body.” The researchers published a study a month prior in the journal Science Advances on using such technology to deliver medicine in animals’ gastrointestinal tract. But the so-called “theragrippers” — which latch onto tissue and release medicine — have not been approved for use in humans, or tested for vaccine administration. “This nanotechnology has shown promise in a laboratory setting,” Johns Hopkins Medicine said in a statement provided to The Associated Press. “However, it is still in its infancy and has not been approved for use in humans.” The statement said the university article “has been inaccurately used for disinformation purposes over the past few months,” noting that the devices are deployed through an endoscope and have “been neither tested nor used for vaccine delivery.” While the university’s article reporting on the research included a photo of the devices on a cotton swab, it did not say they are delivered that way. Instead, the cotton swab was used to convey the size of the devices, saying that “a theragripper is about the size of a speck of dust.” The COVID-19 vaccines that are currently authorized for use in the U.S. are administered via shots into one’s muscle. — Associated Press writer Angelo Fichera in Philadelphia contributed this report. ___ Image of girl with gun is an old meme, not recent Ukraine photo CLAIM: A photo of a girl on a bus with a rifle shows “life in Ukraine, now.” THE FACTS: The photo shows a Russian social media influencer holding a fake gun after a photo shoot in March 2020, not a recent image of life in Ukraine amid warnings of an imminent Russian invasion. The image was taken well before tensions began escalating between the two countries in recent weeks. A Twitter user shared the photo — which shows a girl scrolling through a smartphone on public transportation while holding a fake gun — last weekend, with a false caption suggesting it was just taken in Ukraine. In reality, the image was taken two years ago in Russia, according to Ekaterina Gladkikh, who lists her location on Instagram as Novosibirsk, a city in Siberia. Gladkikh told The Associated Press through direct messages on Instagram that she was returning from a photo shoot when the image was taken. “With this fake weapon, I managed to sit in a cafe and, as you can see, and take a ride in transport. None of the passers-by or the guards asked me any questions,” she said. “I live in Russia, not in Ukraine,” she added. In other photos posted on Instagram, she can be seen wearing the same beige hat from the widely shared photo. She also posted a story highlight video in March 2020 where she was wearing the same distinctive nail polish as the photo — one hand was painted with red nail polish, while the other was painted with blue polish. Reverse image search results show the photo has also appeared over time on Facebook and Twitter, with captions from 2020 and 2021 asserting it showed “a normal day in Russia.” One Facebook post from March 2020, the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, captioned the photo: “Slav Girl in need of social distance in bus.” An April 2020 entry on a blog post headlined “Evolution of a Meme: Girl in Belarus on a Bus with AK,” discussed how the image had been repurposed multiple times by online meme pages. The photo has begun recirculating in recent days as tensions mount between Russia and Ukraine. — Associated Press writers Arijeta Lajka in New York and Sophia Tulp contributed this report. ___ PA school board didn’t vote to ban CNN in classrooms CLAIM: A school board in suburban Pittsburgh voted to ban CNN from its classrooms. THE FACTS: Teachers can still use their own discretion to show instructional videos from any source, including CNN, according to Norwin School District Superintendent Jeff Taylor. The Norwin School Board had voted on Monday to stop routinely playing television programs during homeroom classes at Norwin Middle School unless they are “student, teacher or administrator driven.” But this vote by the Pittsburgh-area school board is being misrepresented online. “School District Just Banned CNN From Classrooms,” read one widely-shared headline. “CNN got thrown out of Pennsylvania classrooms for being FAKE NEWS!” a Twitter user wrote. “Pennsylvania school removes CNN from classrooms, can choose patriotic videos instead,” read a misleading Fox News headline. While the article itself contained more nuance, users on Instagram posted screenshots of the headline alone that racked up tens of thousands of likes. Taylor explained in a phone interview that teachers in the district still have the option to play CNN or any other media source they deem has instructional value. Taylor said the claims stemmed from the middle school’s use of CNN 10, a 10-minute daily digital news program for students, publicly available on CNN’s website. The program had been shown to students during the homeroom period at Norwin Middle School since 2018. In a workshop meeting  on Jan. 10, a school board member expressed concern over the program, saying it hadn’t been approved by the board and that he would like to remove it from the classroom. However, the motion that ultimately came to a board vote didn’t specifically address CNN 10. Instead, the board voted to stop showing TV programs during homeroom at Norwin Middle School to allow students to socialize and interact, unless the program was “either student, teacher or administrator driven.” A video of Monday’s meeting shows Taylor asked the board to clarify whether the phrase “teacher driven” meant teachers could still opt to show CNN 10 videos to their students. “I believe that’s the intent of the motion,” said board member Raymond Kocak. No board members expressed dissent, and the board approved the motion with a 5-4 vote. Taylor told the AP that “student, teacher or administrator driven” could be understood to mean hand-selected by those individuals. He clarified that the board’s decision covered homeroom classes for Norwin Middle School only, and did not affect curriculum for other classes or schools in the 5,300-student K-12 district. Taylor reiterated the importance of teaching current events in the classroom and pointed out that Pennsylvania state curriculum standards require it. Reached for comment, Fox News Digital Deputy Managing Editor Kelley Kramer said, “The Norwin School Board voted to end student programming from classrooms, which is accurately reflected in the FOX News Digital story.” A spokesperson for WarnerMedia, which owns CNN, declined to comment. — Associated Press writer Ali Swenson in New York contributed this report. ___ Prosecutors in DC haven’t charged Trump’s children with crimes CLAIM: Prosecutors in the District of Columbia recently filed criminal charges against Ivanka Trump and her brothers. THE FACTS: District prosecutors have not filed any criminal charges against Ivanka Trump, Eric Trump or Donald Trump Jr., according to a spokesperson for the Office of the Attorney General for the District of Columbia. The YouTube commentator who made the claim, Christo Aivalis, has also admitted it is false. Aivalis made the claim in a video titled, “Ivanka Trump CHARGED with MAJOR CRIME.” In the clip, Aivalis cites a news article discussing new developments in an ongoing lawsuit filed in January 2020 by District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine against former President Donald Trump’s inaugural committee, the Trump International Hotel and the Trump Organization, alleging that the committee overpaid the hotel to enrich the Trump family. But the suit involving the inaugural committee is a civil matter, not a criminal case. None of Trump’s children are named as defendants, although the suit alleges that Ivanka Trump was involved. Reached by the Associated Press for comment, Aivalis admitted that the claim in his video is inaccurate. “I appear to have been mistaken in this regard, misunderstanding the nature of the efforts by DC officials,” Aivalis wrote in an email to the AP. The District of Columbia attorney general’s office has not filed any criminal charges against Ivanka Trump, Eric Trump or Donald Trump Jr., spokesperson Marrisa Geller confirmed to the AP. Alan Garten, executive vice president and chief legal officer at the Trump Organization, wrote in an email to the AP that the claim that the three siblings have been criminally charged is “completely untrue.” The lawsuit filed by prosecutors in the District of Columbia alleges that the committee spent over $1 million to book a ballroom at the Trump International Hotel in the capital, and that one of the event’s planners raised concerns about the high price with Ivanka. Ivanka  has said she instructed the hotel to charge a “fair market rate.” Racine’s office announced on Thursday that the case is going to trial, according to a news release. — Associated Press writer Josh Kelety in Phoenix contributed this report. ___ Find AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck ___ Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck",western,1,2052,97.25,35.32,24,17.94,23.32,27.19,75.05,52.53,42.5,5.02,1.71,0.24,0,0.15,0.58,0.54,3.31,14.86,10.23,2.19,15.35,4.48,2.05,4.04,1.17,9.99,3.8,2.29,4.14,0.34,0.34,3.27,8.28,0.24,8.04,1.22,1.22,0.58,1.27,0.24,3.7,0,2.05,0.93,1.12,0.29,0.15,0.15,0,0.05,0,0,11.11,6.82,0.29,0.05,0.49,0.49,4.24,4.14,0.1,0,0.68,0.19,2.92,1.02,0.39,1.51,6.87,0.39,0,5.85,0.54,0.15,1.22,0.93,0.63,0,0,0,0,0.05,0,0.24,0,0.58,0.15,0,0,0.05,0.1,0.34,2.29,8.19,0.34,0.88,6.04,0.97,0.05,0.1,3.31,5.85,2.19,0.24,0.44,0.44,0,0,0,16.57,4.48,4.48,0,0.05,1.12,6.43
972,apnews.com,2022-02-17 08:00:00,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-europe-russia-united-states-moscow-029f7416b35e905901ea10bf3019dafb,NATO : Russia misleads world on troop movements near Ukraine,English,United States,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Fears of a new war in Europe resurged Thursday as U.S. President Joe Biden warned that Russia could invade Ukraine within days, and violence spiked in a long-running standoff in eastern Ukraine that some worried could provide the spark for wider conflict. World dignitaries raced for solutions, but suspicions between East and West only seemed to grow, as NATO allies rejected Russian assertions it was pulling back troops from exercises that had fueled fears of an attack. Russia is believed to have built up some 150,000 military forces around Ukraine’s borders. Concerns escalated in the West over what exactly Russia is doing with those troops, which included an estimated 60% of Russia’s overall ground forces. The Kremlin insists it has no plans to invade, but it has long considered Ukraine part of its sphere of influence and NATO’s eastward expansion an existential threat. The U.S. government issued some of its starkest, most detailed warnings yet about what could happen next. Speaking at the U.N. Security Council, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken revealed some conclusions of U.S. intelligence in a strategy that the U.S. and Britain have hoped will expose and pre-empt any invasion planning. The U.S. has declined to reveal much of the evidence underlying its claims. He told the diplomats that a sudden, seemingly violent event staged by Russia to justify invasion would kick it off. Blinken mentioned a “so-called terrorist bombing” inside Russia, a staged drone strike, “a fake, even a real attack … using chemical weapons.” The assault would open with cyberattacks, along with missiles and bombs across Ukraine, he said. Painting the U.S. picture further, Blinken described the entry of Russian troops, advancing on Kyiv, a city of nearly 3 million, and other key targets. U.S. intelligence indicated Russia also would target “specific groups” of Ukrainians, Blinken said, again without giving details. In an implicit nod to Secretary of State Colin Powell’s appearance before the Security Council in 2003, when he cited unsubstantiated and false U.S. intelligence to justify the U.S. invasion of Iraq, Blinken added: “Let me be clear. I am here today not to start a war, but to prevent one.” Biden’s own comments on the Russian threat were unusually dire. Speaking at the White House, he said Washington saw no signs of a promised Russian withdrawal, and said the invasion threat remains “very high” because Russia has moved more troops toward the border with Ukraine instead of pulling them back. “Every indication we have is they’re prepared to go into Ukraine, attack Ukraine,” Biden told reporters. He said the U.S. has “reason to believe” that Russia is “engaged in a false flag operation  to have an excuse to go in,” but did not provide details. The White House said Biden planned to speak by phone Friday with trans-Atlantic leaders about Russia’s military buildup and continued efforts at deterrence and diplomacy. U.S. and European officials were on high alert for any Russian attempts to create a pretext for invasion, according to a Western official familiar with intelligence findings. Ukrainian government officials shared intelligence with allies that suggested the Russians might try to shell the Luhansk area in the disputed Donbas region on Friday morning as part of an effort to create a false reason to take military action, according to the official who was not authorized to comment publicly. Renewed fear of an invasion put global financial markets on edge. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 600 points, or 1.7%. More than 85% of the stocks in the benchmark S&P 500 were in the red. Even without an attack, the sustained Russian pressure on Ukraine has further hobbled its shaky economy and left an entire nation under constant strain. Eastern Ukraine already has been the site of fighting since 2014 that has killed 14,000, and tensions soared again Thursday. Separatist authorities in the Luhansk region reported an increase in Ukrainian government shelling along the tense line of contact. Separatist official Rodion Miroshnik said rebel forces returned fire. Ukraine disputed the claim, saying separatists had shelled its forces but they didn’t fire back. The Ukrainian military command said shells hit a kindergarten in Stanytsia Luhanska, wounding two teachers, and cut power to half the town. The head of the monitoring mission for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Yasar Halit Cevik, said it reported 500 explosions along the contact line from Wednesday evening to Thursday. Cevik told the Security Council the tensions then appeared to ease, with about 30 blasts reported. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy tweeted that the kindergarten shelling “by pro-Russian forces is a big provocation.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov countered with the same: ”We have repeatedly warned that the excessive concentration of Ukrainian armed forces in the immediate vicinity of the line of demarcation, coupled with possible provocations, could pose a terrible danger.” A 2015 deal brokered by France and Germany helped end the worst of the fighting, but regular skirmishes have continued and a political settlement has stalled. Western powers scrambled to avert, or prepare for, eventual invasion. NATO’s defense ministers discussed ways to bolster defenses in Eastern Europe, while EU leaders huddled over how to punish Russia if it invades. Blinken and Vice President Kamala Harris are among political, military and diplomatic leaders heading to the annual security conference in Munich that will see urgent consultations on the crisis. China, a key Russian geopolitical ally, accused Washington of “playing up and sensationalizing the crisis and escalating tensions.” Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said the U.S. should “take seriously and address Russia’s legitimate and reasonable concerns on security assurance.” At NATO headquarters in Brussels, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin questioned the Russian troop pullout claims. “We’ve seen some of those troops inch closer to that border. We see them fly in more combat and support aircraft,” he said. “We see them sharpen their readiness in the Black Sea. We even see them stocking up their blood supplies. You don’t do these sort of things for no reason, and you certainly don’t do them if you’re getting ready to pack up and go home.” British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said the West has seen “an increase of troops over the last 48 hours, up to 7,000.” That squared with what a U.S. administration official said a day earlier. Maxar Technologies, a commercial satellite imagery company monitoring the Russian buildup, reported continued heightened military activity near Ukraine. It noted a new pontoon bridge and a new field hospital in Belarus. Russia says the pullout, announced earlier this week, will take time. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj.-Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russian tank and infantry units holding drills in the Kursk and Bryansk regions neighboring Ukraine were returning to their bases in the Nizhny Novgorod region. He said some already were back after a 700-kilometer (435-mile) journey. Troops on maneuvers in Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, have moved back to Russia’s North Caucasus, he said, and Russian troops in Belarus will return to their garrisons after war games end Sunday. Konashenkov didn’t mention how many were deployed and didn’t say how many returned. Russia held out a new offer of diplomacy Thursday, handing the U.S. a response to offers to engage in talks on limiting missile deployments in Europe, restrictions on military drills and other confidence-building measures. The response, released by the Foreign Ministry, deplored the West’s refusal to meet the main Russian security and demands and reaffirmed that Moscow could take unspecified “military-technical measures” if the U.S. and its allies continue to stonewall its concerns. At the same time, it said Russia was ready to discuss limits on missile deployments, restrictions on patrol flights by strategic bombers and other confidence-building steps. Meanwhile, Russia ordered the deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, Bart Gorman, to leave the country, in what the State Department called an “unprovoked” move. Russia said it was in response to the expulsion of a Russian diplomat. It appeared more linked to an ongoing U.S.-Russia battle over diplomatic staffing in Washington and Moscow than to Ukraine. ___ Isachenkov reported from Moscow, Superville from Washington and Cook from Brussels.

It comes after the US president warned Russia could be about to stage a justification to invade Ukraine. Joe Biden said military action could begin imminently but stressed that a diplomatic solution was still possible. Russia said the claims were ""baseless"" and accused the US of stoking tensions. Moscow says it is conducting military drills and says some troops have been moved back to their permanent bases in recent days. Western powers say at least 130,000 Russian soldiers have been stationed in reach of Ukraine's borders and they have seen no evidence of a withdrawal. On Friday, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock became the latest senior Western politician to voice concerns over Russia's massive build-up of military personnel and equipment near its border with Ukraine and in Belarus, a Russian ally - effectively encircling Ukraine on three sides. In a statement released ahead of the annual Munich Security Conference, where world leaders will meet for three days from Friday, she warned Russia was ""challenging fundamental principles of the European peace order"" with its ""unprecedented deployment of troops"" and ""Cold War demands"". Her comments refer to a series of demands Russia has made over European security, which seek to limit Western military power in countries Russia sees as within its own sphere of influence. The West rejects the idea that Russia has a right to influence the foreign policy of countries close to its borders, as the Soviet Union did during the Cold War. The Cold War was the post-war period of the 20th Century when the rivalry between the West and the Soviet Union brought two global superpowers to the brink of nuclear war. Ms Baerbock called for diplomacy to continue, saying ""even tiny steps towards peace are better than big steps towards war"". This video can not be played Watch: This is a moment of peril, says US Secretary of State Joe Biden warned on Thursday that Russia could be about to engage in a false flag operation which would give it an excuse to invade Ukraine. A false flag is a fabricated attack a country stages against its own interests in order to justify a retaliation. Russia denies having any such plans. Later, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken gave more details to the United Nations Security Council of what such a move could look like. He said it was not clear what form a pretext for an attack could take, but that possibilities include ""a fabricated so-called terrorist bombing inside Russia, the invented discovery of a mass grave, a staged drone strike against civilians, or a fake - even a real - attack using chemical weapons."" In the aftermath of such an incident, Mr Blinken said Russia's government would likely ""theatrically convene"" an emergency meeting about protecting ethnic Russians in Ukraine - and Russian missiles and bombs would begin striking Ukrainian targets, alongside cyber-attacks. The US has not provided evidence for the allegation, and Mr Blinken acknowledged that some people may question the claims. ""But let me be clear. I am here today not to start a war but to prevent one,"" he said. The concerns were echoed by other Western leaders. Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned of ""a pretext for an armed attack"", while UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and Prime Minister Boris Johnson alleged that a false flag operation was being planned. Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed rebels in the country's east continued to accuse each other of shelling and other ceasefire violations on Friday. Such breaks in the area's years-long ceasefire are not uncommon. Each side blamed the other for Thursday's violence. Ukrainian officials accused Russia-backed separatists of striking a nursery in the town of Stanytsia Luhanska, smashing through a wall into a children's music room. Three adults - but no children - were injured. Russia-backed rebels, meanwhile, claimed Ukrainian forces had shelled a number of locations under rebel control and accused them of escalating the conflict. On Thursday, Russia sent a formal response to US proposals for negotiation in the crisis which both offered a potential route to diplomacy, and threatened further action. In the document, Russia said it was open to discussions about inspections of missile sites on both sides but said the US had failed to address its main security concerns about the expansion of Nato near its border. Russia said that if that issue was not dealt with, ""military-technical means"" would be deployed in response - though it remains unclear what that could amount to. Despite such concerns, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba earlier said that ""diplomacy is working"". ""We can never say for sure what happens tomorrow, but today we do our utmost"" to maintain peace, he said. ""We're very much ready for any situation.""",western,1,818,94.17,42.93,38.45,1.28,23.37,28.73,84.72,58.31,44.62,5.99,2.08,0.24,0.86,0,0.61,0.37,3.91,14.91,8.8,0.98,14.55,6.36,1.96,3.79,1.1,12.71,7.09,3.06,8.8,1.59,1.1,6.11,10.51,0.37,10.15,1.59,1.59,1.47,1.47,0.24,3.42,0,5.99,1.34,4.65,0.12,0,0.12,0.12,0,0,0,12.59,8.31,0.24,0.49,1.96,0.98,3.42,4.4,0,0.12,0.37,0.61,7.21,5.01,1.83,0.37,3.42,0.37,0.12,2.93,0,0,0.37,0.24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.12,0.37,0,0.24,0.12,0,0,0,1.83,0.49,3.42,10.76,1.22,1.47,7.21,0.61,0.24,0.61,4.65,5.26,2.81,1.59,0,0,0,0,0,15.16,4.28,3.79,0,0,1.22,5.87

Russian President Vladimir Putin will personally oversee Saturday’s exercise, which will involve multiple practice launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles and cruise missiles, the Defense Ministry said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin would observe the drills from the Defense Ministry’s situation room and supervise the practice missile launches himself. The ministry said it planned the maneuvers some time ago to check the readiness of Russia’s military command and personnel, as well as the reliability of its nuclear and conventional weapons. The war games follow U.S. President Joe Biden’s warning  on Thursday that Russia could invade Ukraine within days. Western fears focus on an estimated 150,000 Russian troops — including about 60% of Russia’s overall ground forces — concentrated near Ukraine’s borders. The Kremlin insists it has no plans to invade. But Moscow has demanded that the U.S. and its allies keep Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations out of NATO, not deploy weapons in Ukraine and pull back NATO forces from Eastern Europe. Washington and its allies bluntly rejected the Russian demands, and Moscow threatened to take unspecified “military-technical measures” if the West continued to stonewall. Russia holds massive drills of its strategic nuclear forces on an annual basis, but the maneuvers planned for Saturday pointedly involve the Black Sea Fleet. The fleet is based on the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. The Black Sea Fleet has surface warships and submarines equipped with Kalibr cruise missiles, but its doesn’t have intercontinental ballistic missiles and didn’t take part in similar previous drills of the country’s strategic forces. In the past, Russia has held the annual strategic forces drills in the fall. U.S. officials have voiced concern that Moscow shifted the exercise to February to coincide with a possible invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin’s Peskov said Russia notified foreign partners about the maneuvers in advance, adding that the exercise shouldn’t cause worries in the West. “Practice launches of ballistic missiles are part of regular training,” he said. “They are preceded by a series of notices to other nations via different channels.” Putin met with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko and invited him to watch Saturday’s maneuvers. The authoritarian Lukashenko, who has edged closer to Moscow amid Western sanctions for his crackdown on domestic protests, has offered to host Russian nuclear weapons. in Belarus, which neighbors Ukraine to the north. The strategic forces of both Russia and the United States include a nuclear triad of land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-based ICBMs and nuclear-capable bombers. The exercise of Russia’s nuclear forces follows a series of sweeping drills that the Russian military held near Ukraine and in Belarus. The Russian military said it started pulling some of troops massed near Ukraine back to their permanent bases after the drills. The U.S. and its allies questioned the claim and said that Moscow has actually moved thousands of new troops closer to Ukraine. Moscow argued that the pullback takes time and rejected Western criticism, saying that it would deploy troops wherever it’s necessary to ensure national security. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the tension between Russia and Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",western,1,551,95.22,40.06,24.61,6.26,21.19,36.66,74.77,52.27,38.48,5.63,1.27,0,0,0,0.73,0.36,4.36,13.25,8.71,0.73,13.61,4.36,1.09,4.9,0.91,9.98,7.8,2.9,11.62,1.63,2,7.99,8.53,0.18,8.35,1.09,2,0.73,1.09,0.18,2.72,0.18,3.45,0.91,2.54,0.91,0,0.91,0.54,0.18,0,0,8.35,5.44,1.09,0,1.63,0,2.54,3.63,0,0,0,1.09,6.53,3.63,1.45,1.45,2,0.54,0.54,0.91,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.18,0,0.54,0.36,0,0,0,0.54,0,1.81,10.71,1.63,1.81,6.9,0.73,0,0.18,3.27,3.99,3.27,1.45,0.18,0.18,0,0,0,16.15,6.17,3.27,0,0,2.9,3.81
398,reuters.com,2021-11-24 08:00:00,https://www.reuters.com/article/global-stress-idUSKBN2I90F5,Column - Yearend stress catalyzed by a restive dollar : Mike Dolan,English,United States,"A U.S. one dollar banknote is seen in this illustration taken November 23, 2021. REUTERS/Murad Sezer/Illustration LONDON, Nov 24 (Reuters) - As the good and great of the investment world try to figure out 2022, they may have taken their eyes off the rest of this year. All of a sudden, the coming yearend -- often an illiquid and erratic period for global markets once the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday is over -- looks incredibly stressful. Much of that is seeded by the long-brewing narrative around post-pandemic inflation, a more urgent ""normalisation"" of central bank settings and a wide divergence in approaches from region to region - not least due to different responses either side of the Atlantic to more waves of COVID-19. Clarity over Jerome Powell's renomination as Federal Reserve chief this week might have been a moment that calmed things down. But all it seems to have done is release more anxiety about recent Fed signals about hastening a taper of its bond buying and possibly bringing forward a first interest rate rise. So much so that in the space of just three weeks money markets have rushed to price three full quarter-point Fed hikes in 2022 compared to the two seen at the start of the month. And they have also pulled in Fed ""lift-off"" day to May from July. While all that may just be second-guessing next year, the market repricing has its main impact now and nowhere more obviously than a super-charged U.S. dollar around the world. A rewriting of Fed scripts has only been matched by a scramble to upgrade dollar forecasts by numerous global banks from Goldman Sachs and Citi to HSBC and Deutsche Bank. A host of political flashpoints worldwide have underlined a bid for perceived dollar safety and liquidity. The picture includes mid-winter energy stress over high oil and gas prices and how to react; rising military tensions in Europe between NATO and Russia over Ukraine and Belarus and even fractious relations between the West and China over Taiwan and militarisation of space. Wild swings in emerging currencies reflect the tremors. A self-contained inflation black spot, policy conundrum and geopolitical worry all on its own, Turkey - who's lira has lost 85% of value against the dollar over the past decade - saw the dollar exchange rate balloon more than 10% on Tuesday alone, clocking a rise of more than 40% so far this month. Turkey's lira may be a longtime outlier and an extreme example. But emerging currencies from South Africa's rand or Poland's zloty and Hungary's forint all hit their lowest for the year this week. And it's not just the currencies of developing economies. The dollar's  index against the other major currencies hit its highest since July 2020, while the greenback hit its highest in four years against Japan's yen and 2021 highs against the euro and sterling. UNCORKED Volatility has been uncorked everywhere, with aggregate measures of foreign exchange volatility And as the Fed gets tough, still deeply negative real, or inflation-adjusted, bond yields have finally broken higher - undermining presumed inflation hedges such as gold and crytocurrencies and whipping away a key bulwark of expensive Big Tech equity valuations. Even the long-dormant VIX (.VIX) of Wall St stock market volatility has twitched back into life. On top of this ""valuation effect"" the rate rise speculation and bond market moves this week saw bond yield curves that measure the gap between 2 and 30-year yields flatten to their lowest since shortly after the U.S. election last year -- flagging growth concerns ahead and seeing the Nasdaq put in its worst two days in two months. ""Interest rate sensitivity came back roaring yesterday pushing down all of our growth baskets,"" said Saxo Bank's equity strategist Peter Garnry, adding there was now potential for a 10% correction in U.S. tech stocks if Treasury yields returned to the March highs. And all this comes at time when dollar funding around the world tends to get seasonally sticky anyhow, even before you deal with the ebbing tide of world liquidity. Dollar funding costs outside the United States hit their highest in almost a year this week, with spreads on 3-month euro-dollar and yen-dollar ,  cross currency basis swaps at their widest since December 2020. But TS Lombard economist Shweta Singh said the FX swap market may no longer even be best measure of dollar funding stress as dollar liquidity ebbs from here. She points out the recent abundance of dollars due to Fed bond buying, emergency facilities and other related expansions of U.S. bank reserves meant offshore borrowers had been tapping domestic money markets more than offshore swaps. This shift had started before COVID-19 as U.S. multinational tax changes in 2017 forced substantial repatriation of huge pools of dollars parked overseas. As a result, direct changes to interbank funding associated with the Fed rate rethink, liquidity reduction and exchange rate fallout could have a much more direct impact around the world going forward. ""The Fed's large balance sheet, standing repo facilities, and swap lines have meaningfully mitigated the ripple effects from a strong dollar to global financing conditions, but they have not eliminated the impact from a strengthening greenback on offshore dollar funding,"" Singh told clients.

REUTERS/Baz Ratner MOSCOW, Nov 21 (Reuters) - The Kremlin on Sunday accused the West of artificially whipping up tensions around Ukraine with repeated statements suggesting Russia was poised to launch an attack on its neighbour and told Washington and its allies to stop a military build-up nearby. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Saturday his country has real concerns, widely shared with partners in Europe, over Russian activities at the Ukrainian border, after Ukraine said it feared Russia might be preparing an attack. U.S., NATO and Ukrainian officials have been making similar statements for nearly two weeks, referring to what they say are unusual Russian troop movements in the proximity of Ukraine. The head of Ukraine's military intelligence told the Military Times outlet this weekend that Russia had more than 92,000 troops amassed around Ukrainian borders and is preparing for an attack by the end of January or beginning of February. Kyrylo Budanov said such an attack would likely involve air strikes, artillery and armoured attacks followed by airborne assaults in the east, amphibious assaults in Odessa and Mariupol and a smaller incursion through neighboring Belarus, Moscow has dismissed such suggestions as inflammatory and complained about what it says is increasing activity in the region by the NATO alliance. In comments due to be broadcast later on Sunday on state TV, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said ""a provocation"" in the area could not be ruled out given all the U.S. rhetoric. ""This hysteria is being artificially whipped up. We are being accused of some kind of unusual military activity on our territory by those who have brought in their armed forces from across the ocean. That is, the United States of America,"" Peskov said. ""It's not really logical or polite."" Peskov suggested Ukraine was probably looking for a way to solve its own problems by force. Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014 and Russian-backed separatists seized a swath of eastern Ukraine that same year. Peskov said Russia wanted NATO to stop ""concentrating a military fist"" near Russia's own borders and to stop arming Ukraine with modern weapons. The Kremlin said in September that NATO would cross a Russian red line if it expanded its military infrastructure in Ukraine.  read more A ship carrying two refitted former U.S. Coast Guard patrol boats designed to beef up the Ukrainian Navy transited the Dardanelles strait on Saturday.  read more Ukraine, which strives to become a NATO member, received a large consignment of U.S. ammunition earlier this year and Javelin anti-tank missiles, prompting criticism from Moscow.

Non-essential staff have been ordered to leave the US Embassy in Kyiv, the State Department announced in a release. Consular services will be suspended from Sunday, although the US ""will maintain a small consular presence"" in the western city of Lviv ""to handle emergencies"". UK ambassador to Ukraine Melinda Simmons has tweeted that she and a core team are staying in Kyiv. Meanwhile, Russia said it has decided to ""optimise"" its diplomatic staff numbers in Ukraine. A foreign ministry spokeswoman cited fears of ""provocations"" by Kyiv or other parties. Attempts to de-escalate tensions through diplomacy are set to continue on Saturday, with both US President Joe Biden and France's President Emmanuel Macron due to speak to Russia's Vladimir Putin by phone. Moscow has accused Western countries of stirring up hysteria. US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Russian forces were now ""in a position to be able to mount a major military action"" in remarks seen as a clear escalation in the urgency of warnings from US officials. ""We obviously cannot predict the future, we don't know exactly what is going to happen, but the risk is now high enough and the threat is now immediate enough that [leaving] is prudent,"" he said. This video can not be played I’m staying in Ukraine, for now: Watch US citizen and English teacher Juan Tec explain why Mr Sullivan added that the administration did not know if Russian President Vladimir Putin had made a final decision to invade, but said that the Kremlin was looking for a pretext to justify military action, which he said could start with intense aerial bombardment. His comments came as US officials warned of a further build-up of Russian troops at Ukraine's borders over the past week and planned Russian military exercises in the Black Sea in the coming days. President Biden has said that he would not send troops to rescue any citizens left stranded in the event of Russian action. On Friday, the US president hosted a video call with transatlantic leaders in which they agreed on co-ordinated action to inflict severe economic consequences on Russia if it invaded Ukraine. The US also said it was deploying a further 3,000 troops from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, to Poland, and that they were expected to arrive there next week. The troops will not fight in Ukraine, but will ensure the defence of US allies. The US has been out in front of its European allies with warnings about the possibility of a Russian attack on Ukraine. But this was a notable increase in urgency. The Americans are worried by the continued build-up of Russian troops, the way they are positioned, and the beginning of military exercises that could serve as a rolling start to an invasion. The latest intelligence assessments prompted President Biden to convene close allies on Friday to tell them he believed President Putin may well soon give a final ""go order,"" according to US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. Mr Biden's top military adviser, Gen Mark Milley, made an unusual number of phone calls in rapid succession - to his counterparts in Russia, Canada, the UK and Europe. The administration has been accused by some of contributing to the escalation with its rhetoric. But it has decided to be ""as transparent as possible"" with the sharing of information, Mr Sullivan said, clearly calculating this to be part of its deterrent strategy. Russian naval drills took place in Crimea on Friday, while 10 days of military exercises continued in Belarus, to the north of Ukraine. Ukraine has accused Russia of blocking its access to the sea. There are fears that if Russia tries to invade Ukraine, the exercises put the Russian military close to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, making an attack on the city easier. Russia says its troops will return to their permanent bases after the drills end. The current tensions come eight years after Russia annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula. Since then, Ukraine's military has been locked in a war with Russian-backed rebels in eastern areas near Russia's borders. The Kremlin says it wants to enforce ""red lines"" to make sure that its former Soviet neighbour does not join Nato. Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the bloc was ""united and prepared for any scenario"".",western,1,801,93.68,67.15,57.95,4.57,23.56,28.59,81.27,59.3,44.94,6.37,2.87,0.12,1.25,0,0.87,0.62,3.5,12.61,8.36,0.5,15.73,7.12,2,4.12,0.87,14.98,6.12,2.37,9.24,3.37,0.62,5.24,8.61,0,8.49,1.37,1.5,1.25,1.37,0.37,2.87,0,4,1,3,0.37,0,0.37,0.37,0,0,0,13.36,6.87,0.75,0.5,1.75,0.37,3.37,7.24,0,0,0.25,1.12,6.87,4.87,1.75,0.25,2.37,0.25,0.25,1.75,0.12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.37,0.12,0.12,0,0.25,0,0,1.37,0.37,2.87,13.11,1.5,2.37,8.86,1,0,0.25,5.74,4.99,4.62,2.25,0.12,0.12,0,0,0,13.98,4.24,4.24,0,0,1.12,4.37

Convoys of Russian anti-aircraft missile systems rumbled along snow-covered roads as part of the maneuvers. Meanwhile, more NATO forces also are on the move, heading to the alliance’s eastern borders, while Britain is putting 1,000 troops on standby to respond to a possible humanitarian crisis in Eastern Europe i f Russia invades neighboring Ukraine and fighting breaks out. Russia has concentrated more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine’s border, but says it has no invasion planned. It wants guarantees from the West that NATO won’t allow Ukraine and other former Soviet nations to join the Western military alliance. Foreign policy advisers from Germany, France, Russia and Ukraine, who met in Paris last month, held another round of talks in Berlin. They reported no progress on the implementation of a 2015 peace agreement that helped end full-scale hostilities between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. Here’s a look at what is happening where and why: BIDEN URGES AMERICANS TO LEAVE UKRAINE U.S. President Joe Biden has repeated his warning that any Americans still in Ukraine should leave as soon as possible. “It’s not like we’re dealing with a terrorist organization. We’re dealing with one of the largest armies in the world. It’s a very different situation and things could go crazy quickly,” he said in an interview with NBC News broadcast Thursday. Asked whether there was any scenario that would prompt him to send U.S. troops to Ukraine to rescue Americans, the president said: “There’s not. That’s a world war when Americans and Russia start shooting at one another.” He argued that if Putin is “foolish enough to go in, he’s smart enough not to, in fact, do anything that would negatively impact on American citizens.” Asked whether he’s ever said that to Putin, Biden said he had. “I didn’t have to tell him that. I’ve spoken about that. He knows that,” Biden said. The State Department for weeks has advised Americans in Ukraine to leave the country. — Darlene Superville in Washington. ___ BORIS JOHNSON AT NATO, THEN IN POLAND British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg are warning that Russia’s ongoing military buildup near Ukraine poses one of the biggest threats to European security in recent memory. “This is probably the most dangerous moment, I would say in the course of the next few days, in what is the biggest security crisis that Europe has faced for decades, and we’ve got to get it right,” Johnson told reporters at NATO headquarters in Brussels. The British leader said he doesn’t believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin has decided to take action against Ukraine. But, Johnson said, “our intelligence, I’m afraid to say, remains grim.” Stoltenberg warned: “The number of Russian forces is going up, the warning time for a possible attack is going down.” He stressed that “NATO is not a threat to Russia, but we must be prepared for the worst.” Stoltenberg said he sent a new letter to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov repeating NATO’s invitation to a series of talks on improving European security. Johnson traveled from Brussels to Warsaw for talks with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki. The two leaders went to meet British soldiers stationed near Poland’s capital as part of a NATO mission to augment the alliance’s eastern flank. Poland borders Belarus, Ukraine and Russia’s Kaliningrad region. “Putin’s political goal is to break up NATO. That’s why we need to stay close together,” Morawiecki said. “On one side of the scales, there is freedom and European security. On the other side, there is destabilization and the things that the Kremlin is cooking up,” he said. “We want to build bridges and connections with Russia, but we want to build them on the foundation of peace,” the Polish prime minister said. — Lorne Cook in Brussels and Jill Lawless in London and Monika Scislowska in Warsaw. ___ TRUSS AND LAVROV TALKS British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss held talks with Lavrov in Moscow, with Truss again warning that attacking Ukraine would “have massive consequences and carry severe costs.” Truss urged Russia to “abandon Cold War rhetoric” and choose the diplomatic route to avoid bloodshed in Ukraine. Lavrov was in no mood to accept a lecture from the West during the first meeting in four years between Britain and Russia’s top diplomats. “Ideological approaches, ultimatums and moralizing is a road to nowhere,” he said. — Sylvia Hui in London. ___ UKRAINE ACCEPTS TURKEY’S MEDIATION OFFER Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu says Ukraine has accepted Ankara’s offer of mediation to reduce the tensions with Russia, while Moscow has not ruled out the idea. “Our discussions with both sides are continuing with sincerity,” Cavusoglu told state broadcaster TRT. “The Ukrainian side wants this. The Russian side has not closed the door, but we will still have contacts with them.” Without naming any countries, Cavusoglu also criticized some Western diplomatic efforts, saying they were stoking tensions instead of easing them. “Are there tensions? Yes. Are there risks? There are. Is the situation fragile? It is. There is concern, there is the risk of a possible conflict. But to announce this, like some Western countries are doing, through megaphone diplomacy is of no benefit,” Cavusoglu said. — Suzan Fraser in Ankara. ___ BRITISH AND U.S. TROOPS ON THE MOVE Britain is putting 1,000 troops on standby to respond to any “humanitarian crisis” in Eastern Europe sparked by a Russian invasion of Ukraine. The U.K. fears a large-scale incursion could cause a mass displacement of people from Ukraine to neighboring countries. The U.K. is also sending hundreds of troops to Estonia and Poland as part of a NATO show of strength. Johnson is expected to offer to deploy more RAF jets to Southern Europe and to send Royal Navy vessels to the eastern Mediterranean. The U.S. also is sending vessels to European waters. The Navy did not directly tie the deployment of four destroyers to the Ukraine crisis but said they will provide “additional flexibility” to the U.S. Sixth Fleet commander, whose area of responsibility includes the Mediterranean, and will operate in support of NATO allies. The four ships are the USS Mitscher and USS Gonzalez, homeported at Norfolk, Virginia, and the USS The Sullivans and USS Donald Cook, based at Mayport, Florida. — Jill Lawless in London and Robert Burns in Washington. ___ DENMARK PLANS DEFENSE TALKS WITH US Denmark said Thursday it will begin negotiations  on a new defense cooperation agreement with the U.S. that may include allowing American troops and military equipment to be stationed on Danish soil — in reversal of a decades-old policy. However, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen stressed that the move is not a response to current Russia-Ukraine tensions. She said talks on intensifying military cooperation between Copenhagen and Washington have been in the works for a long time. “An increased American commitment here in Denmark will improve the access of the United States to the European continent,” Frederiksen said in comments quoted by Danish public broadcaster DR. Danish Defense Minister Morten Boedskov told reporters that no American military bases would be established in Denmark, and he declined to comment on where U.S. troops would be placed in the country. — Jari Tanner in Helsinki.

Peter Klaunzer/ Pool via REUTERS Dec 6 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin  will speak by video link on Tuesday.  read more  Since their Geneva summit in June, the list of contentious issues between their two countries has lengthened. Here's a quick summary. The United States has warned Russia it will face ""severe costs"" including high-impact economic sanctions if it invades Ukraine, which says more than 94,000 Russian troops have gathered within reach of its border. Washington has urged a return to accords signed in Minsk in 2014 and 2015 L8N2SN5QOthat were designed to end a war between Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed separatists in the east of Ukraine that has now dragged on for seven years. Russia says its troop deployments are a response to aggressive behaviour by NATO and Ukraine, including U.S. strategic bomber flights and warship manoeuvres in the Black Sea. It is demanding legally binding security guarantees from the West that NATO will not expand further eastwards - which would prevent Ukraine becoming a member - or deploy missiles in Ukraine that would target Russia. The United States says no country can veto Ukraine's NATO aspirations. The United States has accused Russia's ally Belarus of ""weaponising"" migrants from the Middle East by encouraging thousands of them to try to enter the European Union from its territory, creating a crisis for the EU. Russia has backed Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko, including by sending nuclear-capable warplanes to patrol Belarusian airspace. The United States has said Russia could and should do more to ease an energy crunch in Europe by increasing gas supplies, and warned it not to use energy as a political weapon, particularly against Ukraine. It has imposed sanctions against Russian entities involved in Nord Stream 2, a newly built gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea. Nord Stream 2 is awaiting approval from a German regulator before Russia can start pumping gas through it, so would be potentially vulnerable to further Western sanctions if the Ukraine crisis escalated. Russia and the United States have shrunk the size of each other's embassies in a series of tit-for-tat moves. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov suggested on Dec. 2 that this was one area where the two countries could seek to draw a line and start afresh by removing limits on representation. The United States has accused hackers working for the Russian government or from Russian territory of mounting cyber attacks against U.S. political parties, companies and critical infrastructure. Russia denies carrying out or tolerating cyberattacks. Biden raised the issue with Putin in June and listed 16 critical areas he said should be ""off-limits"" to cyberattacks, but the two sides have not publicly signalled any progress on the issue since then. Soon after Biden took office, the two countries extended a key agreement limiting the size of their strategic nuclear arsenals. In Geneva they promised ""to lay the groundwork for future arms control and risk reduction measures"" and Biden said it would take six months to a year to find out whether a meaningful strategic dialogue was possible. So far there have been no obvious signs of progress. Washington has criticised the imprisonment of Alexei Navalny, Putin's most prominent political opponent, and may restate its concerns over human rights in Russia. The U.S. side has repeatedly raised the cases of two former Marines, Trevor Reed and Paul Whelan, who have been jailed in Russia on what it regards as false charges. The two countries are at odds over various issues including Syria, where Russia intervened militarily in 2015 to prop up President Bashar al Assad in a civil war. But U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week there were also areas where they could work together, despite their tensions. He mentioned international efforts to stop Iran acquiring nuclear weapons, and the peace process between former Soviet republics Armenia and Azerbaijan, in which Moscow has taken the leading role.

Amid the soaring tensions, the White House warned that Russia could attack its neighbor at “any point,” while the U.K. delivered a batch of anti-tank weapons to Ukraine. Russia’s Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin said the joint drills with Belarus would involve practicing a joint response to external threats. Ukrainian officials have warned that Russia could launch an attack on Ukraine from several directions, including from its ally Belarus. The U.S. again stressed its concern Tuesday, with White House press secretary Jen Psaki describing the Russian forces’ move into Belarus as part of as “extremely dangerous situation.” “We’re now at a stage where Russia could at any point launch an attack in Ukraine,” she said. A series of talks last week between Russia, the U.S. and NATO failed to quell the tensions over Ukraine. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will meet his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Geneva on Friday in another attempt to defuse the crisis. Ukraine’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday it has received a shipment of anti-tank weapons from the U.K., noting that they will help “strengthen our defense capability.” Russia already has started moving troops for the war games in Belarus. Fomin said it would take through Feb. 9 to fully deploy weapons and personnel for the Allied Resolve 2022 drills, which are expected to take place Feb. 10-20. Fomin didn’t say how many troops will be involved, but mentioned that Russia will deploy a dozen Su-35 fighter jets and several air defense units to Belarus. The deployment would bolster an estimated 100,000 Russian troops with tanks and other heavy weapons who are already amassed near Ukraine. Russia has denied that it intends to attack its neighbor but demanded guarantees from the West that NATO will not expand to Ukraine or other former Soviet nations or place its troops and weapons there. Washington and its allies firmly rejected Moscow’s demands during Russia-U.S. negotiations in Geneva and a related NATO-Russia meeting in Brussels last week. Fomin said the drills in Belarus, which involve an unspecified number of troops from Russia’s Eastern Military District, reflect the need to practice concentrating the country’s entire military potential in the west. “A situation may arise when forces and means of the regional group of forces will be insufficient to ensure reliable security of the union state, and we must be ready to strengthen it,” Fomin said at a meeting with foreign military attaches. “We have reached an understanding with Belarus that it’s necessary to engage the entire military potential for joint defense.” Belarus’ authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said the joint maneuvers will be conducted on Belarus’ western border and in the country’s south, where it borders Ukraine. Lukashenko, who has edged increasingly close to Russia amid Western sanctions over his government’s crackdown on domestic protests, has recently offered to host Russian nuclear weapons. A senior Biden administration official said the Russian troop deployment to Belarus raises concerns that Moscow may be planning to stage troops there to stretch Ukraine’s defenses with an attack from the north. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive issues, noted that the movement may also indicate Belarus’ willingness “to allow both Russian conventional and nuclear forces to be stationed on its territory.” Amid the tensions, Ukraine’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday that it was speeding up efforts to form reserve battalions that would allow for the rapid deployment of 130,000 recruits to expand the country’s 246,000-strong military. The United States and its allies have urged Russia to deescalate the situation by calling back the troops amassed near Ukraine. “In recent weeks, more than 100,000 Russian troops with tanks and guns have gathered near Ukraine without an understandable reason, and it’s hard not to understand that as a threat,” German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told reporters Tuesday after talks in Moscow with her Russian counterpart, Lavrov. Lavrov responded by restating Moscow’s argument that it’s free to deploy its forces wherever it considers it necessary on its territory. “We can’t accept demands about our armed forces on our own territory,” Lavrov said. “We aren’t threatening anyone, but we are hearing threats to us.” Baerbock emphasized that the West was ready “for a serious dialogue on mutual agreements and steps to bring everyone in Europe more security.” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg met with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin on Tuesday. He said “the main task now is to make progress on the political way forward” to prevent a military attack against Ukraine. “NATO allies are ready to meet with Russia again, and today I have invited Russia and all the NATO allies to attend a series of meetings in the NATO-Russia Council in the near future to address our concerns but also listen to Russia’s concerns,” Stoltenberg said. He added that NATO “in the near future” will deliver its written proposals in response to Russian demands and “hopefully we can begin meeting after that.” “We need to see what Russia says, and that will be a kind of pivotal moment,” the NATO chief said. Lavrov, meanwhile, reaffirmed that Russia wants a quick Western answer to its demand for security guarantees that would preclude NATO’s expansion to Ukraine and limit its presence in Eastern Europe. He repeated that in a phone conversation with Blinken, who will visit Ukraine on Wednesday and meet with Lavrov on Friday. Speaking on a visit Tuesday to Ukraine, Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly denounced the Russian troop buildup as unacceptable. She noted Canada’s efforts to help train Ukraine’s military, adding that it’s currently considering Ukraine’s demand to provide it with military equipment and will make “a decision in a timely manner.” Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 after the ouster of Ukraine’s Moscow-friendly leader and also threw its weight behind a separatist insurgency that took over large sections in eastern Ukraine. More than 14,000 people have been killed in nearly eight years of fighting there. ___ Aamer Madhani and Ellen Knickmeyer in Washington, Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lorne Cook in Brussels, and Yuras Karmanau in Kyiv, Ukraine, contributed to this report.",western,1,1060,92.11,64.05,30.94,8.08,23.56,30.85,79.43,55.19,43.21,8.11,2.74,0.09,1.23,0.19,0.75,0.09,5.38,12.92,7.26,1.23,15.85,5.66,2.45,4.34,0.47,11.13,5.47,3.11,10.47,3.21,0.85,6.42,8.77,0.19,8.21,1.51,1.51,1.51,1.23,0.57,2.26,0,3.96,1.32,2.64,0.38,0.09,0.28,0.19,0.09,0,0,12.64,7.55,1.04,0,1.51,0.09,3.96,5.47,0,0.09,0.28,0.57,5.66,3.87,1.51,0.28,2.55,0.19,0.38,1.98,0,0,0.28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.19,0.09,0.47,0.19,0.94,0.09,0.09,0,0,1.13,0,2.74,10.94,0.47,1.23,8.3,0.38,0.19,0.57,4.25,3.68,2.83,2.74,0.38,0.38,0.19,0,0,17.17,5.19,4.53,0,0,2.83,4.62

Merkel reiterated her accusation that Belarus was carrying out a “hybrid attack” by luring migrants to the country and then sending them to the Polish border in an effort to destabilize both Poland and the European Union as a whole. “Therefore full solidary with Poland on the one hand, and on the other hand I want to of course express very clearly that this is an issue between the European Union and Belarus, and that’s why everything that happens bilaterally needs to be coordinated,” she told reporters after a meeting in Berlin with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki. Her comments were seen as a response to Polish criticism that she had failed to coordinate with Warsaw before recently reaching out to Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko. After Merkel’s call, Belarus began repatriating some migrants back to Iraq. Merkel said the EU would impose additional sanctions on Belarus “if no progress is seen.” She also stressed the role that Belarus’ close ally Russia could play in putting pressure on Minsk. That sentiment was echoed by Morawiecki, who said that there was a “cordial request (to Putin) to exert influence on the situation in Belarus.” Morawiecki said trade sanctions would be a powerful instrument against Belarus. Separately, Merkel lamented that Putin had refused her suggestion for a summit on the situation in Ukraine. “I greatly regretted that neither the Russian president nor the Russian foreign minister were prepared to hold one more high-level meeting under the Normandy format before the end of my time in office,” Merkel said, referring to the four-way talks between Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France. Such talks have been staged repeatedly over the years to resolve tensions between Ukraine and its neighbor Russia, with limited success. “This would have been a good signal that all sides are interested in a solution to the Ukraine issue,” Merkel said. “This, sadly, didn’t happen.”",western,1,333,91.09,45.39,12.24,8.88,23.79,30.63,78.08,57.36,47.75,8.41,3.6,0.9,0,0,2.1,0.3,4.8,17.72,8.41,0.6,16.22,6.61,2.1,5.11,1.2,12.01,3.3,3.6,5.11,0.6,1.5,3,10.21,1.5,8.71,0.9,0.9,2.1,0.3,0.9,2.1,0,5.11,1.8,3,2.1,0.6,1.2,0.3,0,0.6,0,12.61,7.51,1.2,0.6,1.2,0.3,3.9,5.11,0,0.3,2.1,0,5.11,3.6,1.5,0,2.7,0.3,0.3,2.1,0.3,0,0.6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.3,0.3,0,0,0.6,0,0.3,0,0.3,3.6,9.91,0.3,0.9,7.51,0.6,0.3,0.6,3.6,6.01,2.4,0.6,0,0,0,0,0,16.82,4.2,4.2,0,0,1.8,6.61

A draft agreement between Russia and its ally Belarus endorsed by Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin says that the Belarusian troops will work to provide “humanitarian assistance” to the population outside combat zones. The document, which is yet to be signed by the countries’ foreign and defense ministries, states that Belarusian troops will act under operational control of the Russian military in Syria when deployed to the country. Russia has waged a military campaign in Syria since 2015, teaming up with Iran to help Syrian President Bashar Assad’s government reclaim control over most of the country after a devastating civil war. The planned deployment of Belarusian troops’ to Syria reflects increasingly close defense ties between the two ex-Soviet neighbors and allies. In recent weeks, Russia has moved troops from Siberia and the Far East to Belarus for sweeping joint drills. The deployment added to the Russian military buildup near Ukraine, fueling Western fears of a possible invasion. Belarus’ authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko, who has increasingly relied on the Kremlin’s political and financial support amid bruising Western sanctions triggered by his crackdown on domestic protests, has called for closer defense ties with Moscow and recently offered to host Russian nuclear weapons. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the main opposition challenger to Lukashenko who was forced to leave the country after Lukashenko’s re-election to a sixth term in an August 2020 vote that the opposition and the West saw as rigged, strongly criticized the deal for sending Belarusian troops to Syria. She described the move as Lukashenko’s payback for Moscow’s support, arguing that it violates the country’s constitution and runs contrary to the national interests. “Lukashenko is paying with Belarus’ sovereignty for the support he received in 2020 that helped him stay in power,” Tsikhanouskaya told The Associated Press. ___ Yuras Karmanau in Kyiv, Ukraine contributed to this report.",western,1,339,99,72.32,21.99,32.5,28.25,37.17,77.58,49.85,38.64,4.42,1.77,0,0,0,1.18,0,2.65,12.68,9.44,1.77,17.99,2.95,0.59,4.13,0,7.37,6.19,2.36,13.27,3.54,1.18,8.55,3.54,0,3.54,0.88,1.77,0.29,0.59,0,0.29,0,6.19,3.54,2.65,0.59,0,0.59,0.29,0.29,0,0,13.86,7.67,3.83,0,1.77,0.29,1.77,5.9,0,0.29,0.29,1.18,8.85,5.31,3.24,0.29,3.54,0,0.59,1.77,1.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.59,0,0,0,0,0,0.29,2.06,11.8,0.29,1.77,9.14,0.59,0,0,3.24,2.95,2.36,1.18,0,0,0,0,0,14.16,3.54,4.13,0,0,3.24,3.24

Moscow, Washington, London, Paris, Berlin, Vienna. Sometimes Kyiv. But only sometimes. These Ukrainians are far from the Russian ships headed to a naval exercise off the coast of Ireland, from the American-built fighter jets streaming to the Baltics and from the U.S. aircraft carrier steadily sailing the Mediterranean. As Western-supplied weapons land by the planeload in Kyiv, soldiers and civilians alike wait here with helpless anticipation for  decisions made by people who know little about the lives of those on the eastern front lines — a battle-weary region near where Russia has massed tens of thousands of soldiers in a troop buildup that U.S. President Joe Biden said could mount the largest invasion since World War II. The soldiers in Zolote 4 have been defending against Russian encroachment for years. They are just a few hundred meters from pro-Russia separatist fighters, who are on the other side of a checkpoint that no one can safely cross. The soldiers assume that’s where the snipers are, though they’ve never seen any gunmen. After three days with no shooting, “all of a sudden they opened up with grenade launchers and firearms. One mortar shell flew over and fell in the field behind us. Two more hit between ours and the next position. In 15 minutes, everything was quiet again. Why? What for? Nobody knows. And that’s how it is around here,” said Oleh Surhov, a Ukrainian soldier who fled Crimea in 2014 after the Russians seized the peninsula. He joined the fight soon after he evacuated his wife, children and grandchildren to western Ukraine. Zolote 1 through 5 got their names decades ago during the Soviet era — the name means “Golden” — when they were labeled as units of the local coal mining operation. Now 1 through 4 are in Ukraine and 5 sits less than a kilometer (half-mile) away, across the checkpoint. The sense of waiting for someone else’s decisions has also infected the nearby village of Katerynivka, which bears the scars of eight years of shelling. It has newer trenches, which are heated by rough wood stoves whose warmth draws nearly as many dogs and cats as soldiers. The luckiest trench cats get taken back by soldiers when they rotate off the front. “We joke that hope is the last thing to die. All of us are waiting for peace. Neither our children nor grandkids can visit us,” said Liubov, a local woman who wouldn’t give her last name. “We talk on the phone and that’s enough. Let’s wait until peace comes!” If war comes instead, it is as likely as not to strike first in eastern Ukraine, where the pro-Russia separatists have been in control since 2014. In Russia, across the border, more than 100,000 troops are gathering, and thousands more are going into position for what Russia says are military exercises on Ukraine’s border to the north with Belarus. Moscow denies it is planning an assault, but the United States and  its NATO allies are preparing for a possible war, bolstering their presence in the Baltics and putting 8,500 American troops on higher alert for potential deployment to Europe. Britain and the U.S. have sent multiple planeloads of weapons to Ukraine. Ukrainian officials have accepted the help but found themselves on the sidelines of several rounds of high-stakes diplomacy that so far have not yielded a breakthrough. “Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said early this month after one such meeting. But Ukraine’s president was left to fume on Twitter last week when Biden mused aloud about how to respond to a “minor incursion.” “We want to remind the great powers that there are no minor incursions and small nations. Just as there are no minor casualties and little grief from the loss of loved ones,” President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote. On Monday, the White House summoned European leaders, including NATO’s secretary-general, to a videoconference about Ukraine to discuss U.S. ideas on how to respond to Russia’s demands. “We have shared those ideas with our European allies and partners. We are taking their feedback. We are incorporating that feedback into the written response,” U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said. Ukraine wasn’t invited to the videoconference, but American officials said their feedback was also key. Ukrainian and Russian representatives met Wednesday in Paris to discuss the prospects for a stalled 2015 peace deal brokered by France and Germany to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The meeting went longer than expected and ended with agreement to meet again — in Berlin. If Ukraine sometimes seems to be an afterthought for the powerful countries deciding its fate, the country’s east is even farther from the centers of power. In Vesele, a separatist area in the eastern Donetsk region, little has changed since the fighting in 2014. Signs still warn about minefields. Concrete block buildings have only crumbled further in the years since they were shelled, and no one has come to tow away the cars hastily abandoned under gunfire. “There is practically no one here, because everything is broken. There is light, gas, water supply, but there is no life,” said Vladimir, a local man who refused to give his last name. He estimated Ukrainian troops were about a kilometer (half-mile) away, and he wanted them gone so people could decide their own fates. “If they would completely leave and liberate” the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, “then we could decide. I think nobody wants (to be a part of) Ukraine here,” he said. But he, like most in the east, believed those decisions were in someone else’s hands. ___ Hinnant reported from Paris.",western,1,962,82.85,64.62,74.37,13.54,17.49,23.91,84.1,63.51,50,8.32,4.68,0.1,1.46,0,0.94,1.56,3.64,14.55,8,2.29,16.11,6.34,5.09,6.65,1.77,13.31,6.65,4.47,6.65,3.12,0.1,3.43,11.75,1.87,9.77,2.81,1.56,1.14,1.87,0.1,3.01,0.1,3.85,1.56,2.18,0.52,0.21,0.21,0,0,0.1,0,12.16,4.78,0.52,0,0.83,0,2.6,7.59,0.73,0,0.31,1.14,3.64,1.98,1.35,0.31,2.91,0.1,0.21,2.49,0.21,0,0.52,0.1,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0.21,0,0.42,0.62,0,0.21,0,0,0.62,0.21,3.64,13.51,0.42,1.77,10.81,0.42,0.21,0.42,5.3,4.26,5.09,1.46,0,0,0,0,0,17.88,6.65,5.3,0.21,0.1,1.46,4.16

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan briefed Senate leadership Monday afternoon amid fast-moving developments. President Joe Biden and Western leaders are working swiftly to persuade Putin not to invade Ukraine, an attack the administration warns could unfold in a matter of days. Biden’s administration is able to impose devastating sanctions on Russia that would cut across the country’s economy, with or without congressional action, senators said. Senators emerged from the closed-door session suggesting all options remain on the table. Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee working to assemble the legislation, said, “Either we’re going to have a sanctions package ...” or “We should express the Senate’s position vis-à-vis the support of Ukraine, at a minimum.” The top Republican on the panel, Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho, said even a Senate resolution backing Ukraine would carry weight: “It sends a message.” Senators are racing time as Putin’s military has amassed at the Ukraine border and in neighboring Belarus as Washington works with Western allies to prevent what experts warn could become a wider war in Europe. The Senate is poised to recess at the end of the week, and lawmakers want a unified response before then. There is broad support in the Senate for imposing sanctions on Russia as a powerful foreign policy tool, but Republicans and Democrats differ on the details and timing. There have also been differences over the Nord Stream 2 energy pipeline between Russia and Germany, although those may have become resolved after Biden said last week the energy line would not continue if Russia invades  Ukraine. Senators considering the options Monday also said the White House has its own strategy, signaling they may hold off as the administration pursues its approach. They said the administration can impose sanctions on its own, regardless of congressional action. “We don’t want to complicate their lives by restricting their ability to engage in diplomacy with Europe,” said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. “I think the deeper we got into it, the more complicated and nuanced the balance became.” Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said administration action could be quicker than the sanctions Congress is considering, especially with the House away until the end of the month. “The administration has all the authorities that it needs under law to level the sanctions that many of us have talked about doing,” Rubio said. “I don’t want anyone to believe that somehow the U.S. won’t be able to respond with sanctions along with our allies if there is an invasion.” Still, senators are eager to act. A resolution would not carry the weight of law, but would nevertheless provide a record of Senate support for Ukraine’s independence in the face of Russian aggression. Such a measure, still being drafted, could come together for a vote, senators said. Late Monday, senators spoke about the strong, bipartisan support the Senate has shown for years toward Ukraine. Congress has approved aid and supplies, and many lawmakers have traveled to the country to stand alongside the Ukrainian people and their leaders. Tensions have mounted in the region as Putin demands assurances from the U.S. and its allies that it won’t accept Ukraine into NATO, a pledge Washington has rejected. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., said Putin’s ambitions extend beyond Ukraine as the Russian president tries to diminish the United States’ stature in Europe and erode the longstanding trans-Atlantic alliance. Shaheen says bipartisan discussions on Ukraine are “an opportunity to show the rest of the world we are united.”",western,1,641,94.61,42.81,26.53,20.23,20.03,28.71,83.31,57.25,44.46,4.68,2.18,0.31,1.09,0,0,0.78,2.5,14.04,10.76,0.16,15.13,7.33,2.5,5.62,1.09,15.29,3.59,2.34,14.51,2.65,1.87,9.83,10.14,0.31,9.83,1.25,0.62,2.34,1.56,0.16,3.43,0,3.12,1.56,1.56,0.31,0,0.31,0,0.31,0,0,11.23,7.49,2.34,0,0.94,0,3.59,4.21,0,0,0,0,9.83,9.2,0.62,0,4.37,0,0.62,3.59,0.16,0,0.31,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.31,0.47,0.47,0.31,0,0,0.47,0.94,0,2.03,9.52,0.31,1.72,6.86,0.62,0,0.16,3.43,2.96,4.68,0.94,0,0,0,0,0,19.19,7.18,5.46,0,0,2.18,4.37

Lasmanis spotted up and swished the shot and then was dogpiled by his three Latvian teammates. They will bring home the country’s first medal of the Tokyo Games. ___ MEDAL ALERT The U.S. team of Stefanie Dolson, Allisha Gray, Kelsey Plum and Jackie Young won the first women’s gold medal in the new Olympic sport of 3-on-3 basketball. Plum scored all five of her points early to help the Americans take the lead and they held on for an 18-15 win over the team representing the Russian Olympic Committee. Plum led all scorers in this tournament. She finished with 55 points over the course of the five-day event in which the U.S. played nine games and only lost one. China beat France 16-14 for the bronze medal and Serbia defeated Belgium 21-10 in the men’s third-place game. ___ MEDAL ALERT Japanese teenager Daiki Hashimoto won a gold medal in men’s all-around. The 19-year-old Hashimoto used a thrilling high bar routine during the final rotation to edge Xiao Ruoteng of China and reigning world champion Nikita Nagornyy. Hashimoto’s all-around total of 88.465 points included a 14.933 on high bar. That was good enough for him to surge past Xiao and into the top spot. The gold is the third straight Olympic title for the Japanese gymnast. Kohei Uchimura won in 2012 and 2016. The win was also a bit of redemption for Hashimoto. He thought his high bar set during the team final lifted Japan to gold but Nagornyy’s rock-solid floor exercise did just enough to give the team representing the Russian Olympic Committee the title. ___ MEDAL ALERT Shi Zhiyong of China set a world record and won his second gold medal in weightlifting in the men’s 73-kilogram category. Shi lifted 166 kilograms in the snatch and 198 in the clean and jerk for a total 364kg. That was one kilogram more than his previous record. Julio Mayora of Venezuela took silver and Rahmat Erwin Abdullah of Indonesia took bronze. Shi won gold at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games in what was then the 69kg category before the classes were reorganized. ___ MEDAL ALERT Jessica von Bredow-Werndl of Germany has unseated Charlotte Dujardin of Britain for gold in the individual dressage competition. German teammate Isabell Werth finished second with a score of 89.657%. She trailed Von Bredow-Werndl’s 91.732% in her Olympic debut. Dujardin came in third at 88.543% after winning the title in 2012 and 2016. Von Bredow-Werndl also helped Germany win the team competition Tuesday for the country’s ninth title in 10 Olympics. She beat Werth for the best individual score then as well. Werth earned her equestrian-record 12th medal but again came up short of the podium’s top spot. The longtime German rider has five silver medals in the individual competition but only one gold from the the 1996 Atlanta Games. ___ A German cycling official has apologized for using a racist slur at the Olympics. German cycling federation sporting director Patrick Moster was shown on TV broadcasts urging rider Nikias Arndt on to catch other riders on the course with a slur typically used for people of North African or Arab ethnicity. An Algerian rider started ahead of Arndt in the event. Moster has apologized in comments to German news agency dpa. He says “in the heat of the moment” he had “made the wrong choice of words.” German Olympic committee president Alfons Hörmann welcomed the apology but says he plans to hold further talks with Moster. ___ MEDAL ALERT Lasha Bekauri of Georgia won an Olympic gold medal in judo in the 90-kilogram middleweight division by beating Eduard Trippel of Germany in the final. The 21-year-old Bekauri capped his impressive rise to judo’s elite levels with a waza ari on Trippel early in the final bout at the Budokan. He held on to win the fourth-ever gold medal in judo for Georgia. Japan failed to win a gold medal in a men’s weight category for the first time in Tokyo when Krisztián Tóth of Hungary knocked off Shoichiro Mukai by ippon 2:55 into golden score during their round of 16 bout. The powerhouse Japanese team had won the first four men’s gold medals in Tokyo. Trippel beat Tóth in the quarterfinals and went on to secure his first Olympic medal. Tóth and Davlat Bobonov of Uzbekistan won bronze. ___ Tennis matches in Tokyo will have later start times beginning Thursday in a move aimed at protecting players amid extreme heat and humidity. The International Tennis Federation says matches will start at 3 p.m. Matches had been starting at 11 a.m. Several players struggled with heatstroke on Wednesday. Daniil Medvedev nearly fainted during his win over Fabio Fognini while Paula Badosa left the court in a wheelchair after retiring from her quarterfinal match against Marketa Vondrousova. The temperature rose to 88 degrees F (31 degrees C) but the heat index made it feel like 99 degrees F (37 degrees C). ___ MEDAL ALERT South Korea has beaten Italy 45-26 to win the men’s team saber fencing final. It’s the South Koreans’ first gold of the Tokyo Olympics in a sport other than archery. No. 1-ranked sabre fencer Oh Sanguk carved out a big lead for South Korea with a 5-0 win over Italy’s Aldo Montano in the second bout. His teammates Gu Bongil, Kim Junghwan and Kim Junho went on to extend the advantage. South Korea retained the title it won in 2012. Team saber was off the Olympic program for the last Games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016. It was South Korea’s fourth gold medal in Tokyo. The other three were won in the team archery competitions. Hungary took its third fencing medal in Tokyo with a 45-40 win over Germany for the bronze medal. ___ MEDAL ALERT Chizuru Arai has won Japan’s sixth gold medal in judo at the Tokyo Olympics, beating Austria’s Michaela Polleres in the final of the women’s 70-kilogram middleweight division. Arai reached her first Olympic final with three ippon victories, surviving a semifinal bout that lasted nearly 17 minutes against Russian athlete Madina Taimazova. The two-time world champion then claimed gold over Polleres with an early waza ari at the Budokan. Arai is just the second Japanese woman to win gold out of five weight categories in Tokyo. The men swept the first four gold medals in Tokyo, but they won’t win a fifth after Shoichiro Mukai fell short before the medal rounds. Japan is still coming away from the first five days in its homegrown martial art with eight medals from 10 weight classes. The final three days of the Olympic tournament include five more opportunities for gold, including the first-ever mixed team competition Saturday. Taimazova and the Netherlands’ Sanne van Dijke won bronze for their first Olympic medals. ___ Canadian gymnast Ellie Black has withdrawn from the all-around finals. The International Gymnastics Federation made the announcement on Wednesday. No reason was given for Black’s withdrawal. The 25-year-old Black is competing in her third Olympics. A silver medalist at the 2017 world championships, Black came in 24th during qualifying at the Ariake Gymnastics Centre. Black will be replaced by Lieke Wevers of The Netherlands in the finals. The decision came hours after reigning Olympic champion Simone Biles took herself out of the all-around competition to focus on her mental health. ___ The U.S. women will play the Russian athletes for the first gold medal in the new Olympic sport of 3-on-3 hoops. Kelsey Plum and Allisha Gray each made free throws to give the United States the winning margin in its 18-16 win over France. Then Russia’s Olga Frolkina made a 2-pointer to seal a 21-14 win over China. The U.S. and teams from the Soviet Union have won every women’s 5-on-5 medal since the sport was introduced to the Olympic program in 1976. Russia’s men’s team upset top-ranked Serbia 21-10 to earn its spot in the gold-medal game. The team officially known as “ROC” – Russian Olympic Committee – will play Latvia in the final. Latvia beat Belgium 21-8. ___ Olympics organizers say an additional 16 people accredited for the Tokyo Games have tested positive for COVID, bringing the total to 174 since July 1. The total includes 20 athletes, though there were no new positive tests among athletes in the cases announced Wednesday. Tens of thousands of people are accredited for the Games. Tokyo also recorded a record daily high of 3,177 COVID-19 cases Wednesday, up from a previous high of 2,848 on Tuesday. ___ Judo’s governing body has formally warned a coach who slapped a female athlete hard in the face twice to prepare her for an Olympic bout. German judoka Martyna Trajdos later defended coach Claudiu Pusa from criticism, saying it was her request “to fire me up” before stepping on the mat. That did not satisfy the International Judo Federation, who issued the warning a day after the incident shocked Olympic viewers. The IJF said it issued “a serious official warning” for the Germany team coach for “the bad behavior he showed.” Judo “is an educational sport and as such cannot tolerate such behavior,” the governing body says. Trajdos, who lost the bout, later wrote on Instagram that “Looks like this was not hard enough” in reference to the slaps. ___ Fiji has beaten New Zealand 27-12 to successfully defend the title it won when rugby sevens made its Olympic debut at Rio de Janeiro in 2016. The gold in Rio was Fiji’s first Olympic medal in any sport. Now the Pacific island nation has two. Jerry Tuwai was in the squad five years ago and he led Fiji in its title defense in Tokyo, where they continued their unbeaten streak in Olympic games. The silver medal was a vast improvement for New Zealand, which missed the podium in 2016 after an upset loss to Japan in its opening game and a quarterfinal loss to Fiji. All the medals went to the southern hemisphere, with Argentina beating 2016 finalist Britain 17-12 for the bronze. South Africa, the bronze medalist in Rio, beat the United States 28-7 in the playoff for fifth place. ___ Tennis player Novak Djokovic’s Golden Slam bid is alive and well. The top-ranked Serb beat training partner Alejandro Davidovich Fokina of Spain 6-3, 6-1 to reach the quarterfinals at the Tokyo Games. Djokovic is attempting to become the first man to achieve a Golden Slam by winning all four Grand Slam tournaments and Olympic gold in the same calendar year. He has already won the Australian and French Opens plus Wimbledon this year. So now he needs the Tokyo Games title and the U.S. Open trophy to complete the unique collection. Djokovic is scheduled to play again later with Serbian partner Nina Stojanovic against Marcelo Melo and Luisa Stefani of Brazil in the opening round of the mixed doubles competition. Djokovic’s quarterfinal opponent in singles will be Kei Nishikori of Japan. Nishikori reached his third straight Olympic quarterfinal by beating Ilya Ivashka of Belarus. ___ MEDAL ALERT Primoz Roglic has capped an incredible month for Slovenian cycling by winning the Olympic time trial. He added a gold medal to the bronze won by Tour de France champion Tadej Pogecar in the road race. Roglic’s closest rival was Dutch time trial specialist Tom Dumoulin, who finished more than a minute behind to win his second consecutive Olympic silver medal. Rohan Dennis of Australia claimed the bronze medal. The prerace favorite, Italian time trial champ Filippo Ganna, faded over the final kilometers and finished fifth. ___ Tennis player Daniil Medvedev has taken exception to a question from a reporter who asked if “Russian athletes are carrying a stigma of cheaters in this Games.” The second-seeded Russian Olympic Committee player responded that for “the first time in my life, I’m not going to answer a question and you should be embarrassed of yourself.” Medvedev then nodded to a Tokyo 2020 staff member to say, “I think you should (ban) him from the Olympic Games or the tennis tournament. I don’t want to see him again on my interview.” The fallout from a state-backed doping scandal led to a ban on Russia competing under the country’s name at the Tokyo Games and at next year’s Beijing Winter Games. The 335 athletes accredited for Tokyo are officially competing for the Russian Olympic Committee, known as ROC. The word “Russia” is banned from their uniforms. Medvedev had just played through extreme heat to reach the quarterfinals. ___ A second Swiss track team member who was supposed to compete at the Tokyo Olympics has been suspended in a doping case. The Court of Arbitration for Sport says it reinstated a provisional suspension for Alex Wilson, who was due to compete in the men’s 100 and 200 meters. Wilson tested positive for the anabolic steroid trenbolone in March. The court says he says it was caused by eating contaminated beef in the United States. World Athletics and the World Anti-Doping Agency intervened with the court to ensure Wilson could not compete in Tokyo after a Swiss tribunal lifted his provisional ban. Switzerland’s Kariem Hussein, a former European 400-meter hurdles champion, is now serving a nine-month ban after testing positive for a stimulant in a case revealed last week. ___ MEDAL ALERT China has won its third gold medal in diving at the Tokyo Olympics. Wang Zongyuan and Xie Siyi won men’s 3-meter synchronized springboard. They finished with 467.82 points after leading throughout the six-dive contest. Andrew Capobianco and Michael Hixon of the U.S. earned silver at 444.36. It’s the same color medal that Hixon won five years ago in Rio with a different partner. Germany’s Patrick Hausding and Lars Rudiger rallied from sixth to take bronze at 404.73. China earlier won gold in women’s 10-meter synchro and women’s 3-meter synchro. The Chinese took silver in men’s 10-meter synchro. ___ The U.S. women’s water polo team lost at the Olympics for the first time since 2008, falling 10-9 to Rebecca Parkes and Hungary in group play. The U.S. was a big favorite to win its third straight gold medal coming into Tokyo, but it was pushed hard by China during a rugged 12-7 victory Monday and then it struggled against Hungary. Even with the loss, it still should be able to advance to the knockout round. Hungary trailed 9-8 with 2:28 left, but captain Rita Keszthelyi scored from deep and Parkes got the game-winner when she connected on a no-look goal with 45 seconds left. Parkes finished with a team-high three goals. The U.S. had the ball in the final seconds but turned it over. It was the United States’ first loss at the Olympics since the 2008 final against the Netherlands. It had a draw in London, but it went 6-0 on the way to the title in Rio. ___ Simone Biles will not defend her Olympic title. The American gymnastics superstar withdrew from Thursday’s all-around competition to focus on her mental well-being. USA Gymnastics said in a statement that the 24-year-old is opting to not compete. The decision comes a day after Biles removed herself from the team final following one rotation because she felt she wasn’t mentally ready. Jade Carey, who finished ninth in qualifying, will take Biles’ place in the all-around. Carey initially did not qualify because she was the third-ranking American behind Biles and Sunisa Lee. International Gymnastics Federation rules limit countries to two athletes per event in the finals. The organization said Biles will be evaluated daily before deciding if she will participate in next week’s individual events. Biles qualified for the finals on all four apparatuses. ___ Quarantined Olympic skateboarder Candy Jacobs says she’s had to take action to be allowed to get fresh air in an isolation hotel in Japan. The Dutch athlete was removed from the Olympic Village after testing positive for COVID-19 a week ago. Jacobs says in a video message posted on Instagram  that “not having any outside air is so inhuman.” She says she refused to move on her seventh day of quarantine in a room where the window doesn’t open. After more than seven hours, she says, officials agreed she could stand at an open window under supervision for 15 minutes a day. Jacobs says “having that first breath of outside air was the saddest and best moment in my life.” The 31-year-old skateboarder missed the street event in the sport’s Olympic debut. Jacobs says watching the event on television was “a super-cool distraction” from quarantine. ___ Two world champions have been knocked out of the Tokyo Olympic boxing tournament in the round of 16. That blows open the brackets at men’s featherweight and men’s light heavyweight. Irish featherweight Kurt Walker pulled off one of the biggest upsets of the tournament with a 4:1 win over Uzbek world champion Mirazizbek Mirzakhalilov. Two hours later, Russian light heavyweight Imam Khataev surprised Kazakh world champ Bekzad Nurdauletov with a 4:1 victory. The 26-year-old Khataev has nearly a decade of high-level amateur experience, but no victories to compare to this upset. Walker controlled the first round and hung on at the end to get a 29-28 decision on four of the five judges’ cards. Walker wouldn’t have been at the Olympics if they had been held on time: His daughter, Layla, was born three months prematurely in May 2020 and required months of hospital care before she emerged healthy. Nesthy Petecio of the Philippines and Italy’s Irma Testa also clinched their nations’ first Olympic women’s boxing medals by advancing to the semifinals at featherweight. ___ The U.S. men’s volleyball team has improved to 2-1 in pool play at the Olympics by beating Tunisia 3-1. The Americans bounced back from a loss to the Russians on Wednesday. They knocked off the lowest-ranked team in their group 25-14, 23-25, 25-14, 25-23. The victory keeps the U.S. in good position to advance to the quarterfinals as one of the top four teams in Pool B. Tunisia has lost all three matches so far in Tokyo. ___ MEDAL ALERT Annemiek van Vleuten has roared to an emphatic victory in the women’s time trial at the Tokyo Olympics. That gave her a measure of revenge for some miscommunication that may have cost her gold in the road race last weekend. The Dutch rider led by more than six seconds at the first time check, then pushed it to an astonishing 28 seconds before she put the hammer down to finish in 30 minutes, 13.49 seconds at Fuji International Speedway. The sixth-from-last rider on the course, van Vleuten was forced to sit on the hot seat for several minutes while those who started after her finished. None of them really had a chance. Marlen Reusser of Switzerland finished more than 56 seconds back to earn the silver medal and van Vleuten’s teammate Anna van der Breggen earned bronze. ___ International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach and Japanese baseball great Sadaharu Oh are attending the opener of the Olympic baseball tournament and were on the field for the ceremonial first pitch in Fukushima. They were joined by Tokyo Organizing Committee President Seiko Hashimoto and World Baseball Softball Confederation President Riccardo Fraccari as a high school baseball player from the region threw out the first pitch -- a full windup from atop the rubber. Bach, wearing bright white gloves on both hands, fist bumped the 14-year-old before Team Japan took the field for its game against the Dominican Republic. It’s the only Olympic baseball game being held in Fukushima, which was devastated by an earthquake and an ensuing tsunami and nuclear accident in 2011. The rest of the tournament will be held at Yokohama Baseball Stadium in Tokyo. Baseball was restored to the Olympic slate this year for the first time since 2008. The sport will be dropped again for the 2024 Games in Paris but is expected to again be played in Los Angeles in 2028. ___ MEDAL ALERT Britain has won the men’s 4x200-meter freestyle relay at the Olympics for the first time since 1908, but just missed a world record. With a powerhouse group that included the 1-2 finishers in the 200 freestyle, Britain blew away the field in 6 minutes, 58.58 seconds. That was just off the world record set by the Americans (6:58.55) at the 2009 world championships. The 200-meter gold medalist, Tom Dean, led off for the British. James Guy and Matthew Richards took the middle legs before 200-meter silver medalist Duncan Scott swam the anchor leg. It was the first British gold in the event since it made its debut at the first London Games. Russia claimed the silver in 7:01.81, while Australia took the bronze in 7:01.84. The four-time defending champion Americans finished fourth -- the first time they’ve failed to win a medal in the event other than the boycotted 1980 Moscow Games. ___ MEDAL ALERT Katie Ledecky has finally collected her first gold medal of the Tokyo Games. Ledecky has won the 1,500-meter freestyle, which made its Olympic debut for women this year. That helped the American star make up for what has so far been the worst showing of her Olympic career. About an hour after finishing fifth in the 200-meter freestyle, Ledecky held off teammate Erica Sullivan to win the metric mile in 15 minutes, 37.34 seconds. Sullivan claimed the silver in 15:41.41, while Germany’s Sarah Kohler grabbed the bronze in 15:42.91. ___ MEDAL ALERT Japanese swimmer Yui Ohashi has swept the women’s individual medley at the Tokyo Olympics. Ohashi rallied to win the 200-meter medley, beating Americans Alex Walsh and Kate Douglass. Ohashi had previously won the 400-meter individual medley. The winning time was 2 minutes, 8.52 seconds. Walsh took the silver in 2:08.65, while the bronze went to Douglass in 2:09.04. Defending Olympic champion and world record-holder Katinka Hosszu of Hungary finished seventh. She was the oldest swimmer in the final at age 32. ___ MEDAL ALERT China has wrapped a record-setting first day of rowing finals by smashing the world record in women’s quadruple sculls and winning gold. The Chinese boat finished in 6 minutes, 0.13 seconds and shaved nearly two seconds off the previous mark set by the Netherlands in 2014. The race was never close. Poland won silver more than 6 seconds behind the Chinese. Australia won bronze for that country’s fourth medal of the day. Windy conditions produced a strong tailwind for the rowers at Tokyo’s Sea Forest Waterway, and new world or Olympic records were set in each of Wednesday’s six medal races. ___ MEDAL ALERT Kristof Milak of Hungary has romped to a dominating victory in the men’s 200-meter butterfly at the Tokyo Aquatics Centre. Milak won the the gold by about two body lengths, backing up his status as one of the biggest favorites at the Olympic pool. He touched in 1 minute, 51.25 seconds -- some 2 1/2 seconds ahead of the silver medalist, Japan’s Tomoru Honda, who finished in 1:53.73. The bronze went to Italy’s Federico Burdisso in 1:54.45. South African star Chad le Clos finished fifth. He won the 200 fly at the 2012 London Olympics, upsetting Michael Phelps, but was no match for the Hungarian star. ___ MEDAL ALERT The Netherlands have set a new world record in men’s quadruple sculls with a sprint over the final 500 meters to win the gold medal. Their time of 5 minutes, 32.03 seconds beat the previous mark of 5:32.26 set by Ukraine at the 2014 world championships. The Dutch boat was fourth after the first 500 meters but had closed to second by the next marker. A late push overtook Great Britain for the lead. Great Britain then held off a late charge by Australia to win silver. Australia’s bronze was the country’s third medal of the day after winning gold in men’s and women’s four. ___ MEDAL ALERT Ariarne Titmus has beaten Katie Ledecky again at the Tokyo Aquatics Centre. Ledecky didn’t even win a medal -- the first time that’s ever happened to her at the Olympics. Titmus gave the Australian women their third individual swimming gold with a victory in the 200-meter freestyle. Titmus set an Olympic record of 1 minute, 53.50 seconds to make it 2-for-2 against the American star, following up a thrilling victory in the 400m freestyle. In the longer race, Titmus conserved her energy over the first half of the race, then rallied to pass Ledecky with the second-fastest performance in history. Ledecky wasn’t even close in the 200, making the first flip in seventh place and never getting higher than her fifth-place showing at the end. She finished in 1:55.21 -- nearly 2 seconds behind the winner. Ledecky is facing a grueling morning that also includes the final of the 1,500 free. She’s a big favorite for gold in that race, which is new to the women’s program this year. Italy’s Federica Pellegrini of Italy finished seventh in her fifth and final Olympics. She won the gold in 2008 and is still the world-record holder. ___ MEDAL ALERT Australia has doubled its haul of Olympic rowing gold medals as the men’s four charged to victory moments after the Aussie women claimed their gold. Australia had bolted to the front by the 500-meter mark and never were challenged for the lead to reach in the finish line as Romania fought a late surge by Italy to claim the silver medal. Australia’s time of 5 minutes, 42.76 set a new Olympic record. Italy won bronze. ___ MEDAL ALERT Australia’s women’s four set a new Olympic-best time to win the gold medal in windy conditions at Tokyo’s Sea Forest Waterway. The Australian boat led at each marker but had to fight off the Netherlands over the last 50 meters to win in 6 minutes, 15.37 seconds, just .34 seconds ahead of the Dutch boat. Ireland took bronze more than 5 seconds back. The windy conditions pushing rowers at the waterpark saw Olympic best times quickly fall as the first three races all saw new standards set. ___ MEDAL ALERT The French team of Hugo Boucheron and Matthieu Androdias has held off a late charge from the Netherlands over the final 50 meters to win the men’s double sculls by 0.2 seconds in Olympic record time of 6 minutes, 33 seconds. China made a strong move out of the start before falling back even with the French and the Netherlands. The Dutch boat of Melvin Twellarr and Stef Broenink briefly held the lead at 1,500 meters. Boucheron and Androdias quickly reeled in the Dutch with a powerful push that was good enough to hold off a late charge at the finish line. China Zhiyu Liu and Liang Zhang finished third for bronze. ___ New U.S. beach volleyball partners Jake Gibb and Tri Bourne will have some more time at the Olympics to get to know one another. The Americans had never played together before their first match in Tokyo on Sunday. They beat Switzerland 21-19, 23-21 on Wednesday to improve to 2-0 in the round-robin. They have one more match remaining, against Qatar on Friday night. Gibb qualified for the Tokyo Games with Taylor Crabb as his partner. But Crabb tested positive for COVID-19 and withdrew, allowing Gibb to replace him. Bourne was on the third-place U.S. team in the qualifying race; each country is limited to a maximum of two spots. Two wins should be enough to put the Americans in the knockout round. At worst, it would put leave them in a three-way tie for first and give them a tiebreaker match. ___ MEDAL ALERT Romania’s Ancuta Bodnar and Simona Radis have won the first rowing gold medal of the Tokyo Games, in women’s double sculls. They bolted from the start and never let up in a dominating performance. The rowing medal events had been delayed for a day because of bad weather forecasts amid a tropical storm. Once back on the water, the Romanians were never challenged and led by two boat lengths with just 500 meters to go. Bodnar and Radis are both just 22. Their sprint to victory left the only fight for the silver medal, where New Zealand’s Brooke Donohue and Hannah Osborne edged the Dutch boat of Roos de Jong and Lisa Scheenaard. ___ — More AP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/olympic-games and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",western,1,4758,98.44,52.35,31.8,63.6,18.23,22.01,77.64,52.9,42.29,4.12,2.52,0.17,0,0.08,1.53,0.55,1.6,16.73,10.97,7.12,15.43,3.91,1.62,4.04,0.59,8.95,5.76,5.4,8.28,0.95,5.57,2.61,4.41,0.53,3.74,0.55,0.97,0.27,0.38,0.08,1.53,0,5.51,4.1,1.35,0.44,0.13,0.25,0,0.02,0.13,0,6.28,2.42,0.88,0.11,0.17,0.13,0.74,4.27,0.02,0.02,1.32,1.11,2.16,0.78,1.28,0.11,4.88,3.55,0.08,1.18,0.04,0.02,0.8,0.46,0.17,0.19,0.04,0.02,0,0.06,0.08,0.13,0.02,0.65,0.08,0.17,0,2.65,0.67,0.02,2.86,10.17,0.69,1.47,7.48,0.55,0.02,0.29,6.12,5.21,1.91,0.55,0.11,0.06,0,0.04,0,17.68,6.75,2.06,0,0,2.06,6.81

The World Economic Forum in Davos. Europe’s largest ports. Airports from Amsterdam to Athens. NATO’s borders with Russia. All depend on equipment manufactured by Nuctech, which has quickly become the world’s leading company, by revenue, for cargo and vehicle scanners. Nuctech has been frozen out of the U.S. for years due to national security concerns, but it has made deep inroads across Europe, installing its devices in 26 of 27 EU member states, according to public procurement, government and corporate records reviewed by The Associated Press. The complexity of Nuctech’s ownership structure and its expanding global footprint have raised alarms on both sides of the Atlantic. A growing number of Western security officials and policymakers fear that China could exploit Nuctech equipment to sabotage key transit points or get illicit access to government, industrial or personal data from the items that pass through its devices. Nuctech’s critics allege the Chinese government has effectively subsidized the company so it can undercut competitors and give Beijing potential sway over critical infrastructure in the West as China seeks to establish itself as a global technology superpower. “The data being processed by these devices is very sensitive. It’s personal data, military data, cargo data. It might be trade secrets at stake. You want to make sure it’s in right hands,” said Bart Groothuis, director of cybersecurity at the Dutch Ministry of Defense before becoming a member of the European Parliament. “You’re dependent on a foreign actor which is a geopolitical adversary and strategic rival.” He and others say Europe doesn’t have tools in place to monitor and resist such potential encroachment. Different member states have taken opposing views on Nuctech’s security risks. No one has even been able to make a comprehensive public tally of where and how many Nuctech devices have been installed across the continent. Nuctech dismisses those concerns, countering that Nuctech’s European operations comply with local laws, including strict security checks and data privacy rules. “It’s our equipment, but it’s your data. Our customer decides what happens with the data,” said Robert Bos, deputy general manager of Nuctech in the Netherlands, where the company has a research and development center. He said Nuctech is a victim of unfounded allegations that have cut its market share in Europe nearly in half since 2019. “It’s quite frustrating to be honest,” Bos told AP. “In the 20 years we delivered this equipment we never had issues of breaches or data leaks. Till today we never had any proof of it.” ___ `IT’S NOT REALLY A COMPANY’ As security screening becomes increasingly interconnected and data-driven, Nuctech has found itself on the front lines of the U.S.-China battle for technology dominance now playing out across Europe. In addition to scanning systems for people, baggage and cargo, the company makes explosives detectors and interconnected devices capable of facial recognition, body temperature measurement and ID card or ticket identification. On its website, Nuctech’s parent company explains that Nuctech does more than just provide hardware, integrating “cloud computing, big data and Internet of Things with safety inspection technologies and products to supply the clients with hi-tech safety inspection solution.” Critics fear that under China’s national intelligence laws, which require Chinese companies to surrender data requested by state security agencies, Nuctech would be unable to resist calls from Beijing to hand over sensitive data about the cargo, people and devices that pass through its scanners. They say there is a risk Beijing could use Nuctech’s presence across Europe to gather big data about cross-border trade flows, pull information from local networks, like shipping manifests or passenger information, or sabotage trade flows in a conflict. A July 2020 Canadian government security review of Nuctech found that X-ray security scanners could potentially be used to covertly collect and transmit information, compromise portable electronic devices as they pass through the scanner or alter results to allow transit of “nefarious” devices. The European Union put measures in place in late 2020 that can be used to vet Chinese foreign direct investment. But policymakers in Brussels say there are currently no EU-wide systems in place to evaluate Chinese procurement, despite growing concerns about unfair state subsidies, lack of reciprocity, national security and human rights. “This is becoming more and more dangerous. I wouldn’t mind if one or two airports had Nuctech systems, but with dumping prices a lot of regions are taking it,” said Axel Voss, a German member of the European Parliament who works on data protection. “This is becoming more and more a security question. You might think it’s a strategic investment of the Chinese government.” The U.S. — home to OSI Systems, one of Nuctech’s most important commercial rivals — has come down hard against Nuctech. The U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, the U.S. National Security Council, the U.S. Transportation Security Administration, and the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security all have raised concerns about Nuctech. The U.S. Transportation Security Administration told AP in an email that Nuctech was found ineligible to receive sensitive security information. Nuctech products, TSA said, “are not authorized to be used for the screening of passengers, baggage, accessible property or air cargo in the United States.” In December 2020, the U.S. added Nuctech to the Bureau of Industry and Security Entity List, restricting exports to them on national security grounds. “It’s not just commercial,” said a U.S. government official who was not authorized to speak on the record. “It’s using state-backed companies, with state subsidies, low-ball bids to get into European critical infrastructure, which is civil airports, passenger screening, seaport and cargo screening.” In Europe, Nuctech’s bids can be 30 to 50 percent below their rivals’, according to the company’s competitors, U.S. and European officials and researchers who study China. Sometimes they include other sweeteners like extended maintenance contracts and favorable loans. In 2009, Nuctech’s main European competitor, Smiths Detection, complained that it was being squeezed out of the market by such practices, and the E.U. imposed an anti-dumping duty of 36.6 percent on Nuctech cargo scanners. “Nuctech comes in with below market bids no one can match. It’s not a normal price, it’s an economic statecraft price,” said Didi Kirsten Tatlow, and co-editor of the book, “China’s Quest for Foreign Technology.” “It’s not really a company. They are more like a wing of a state development drive.” Nuctech’s Bos said the company keeps prices low by manufacturing in Europe. “We don’t have to import goods from the U.S. or other countries,” he said. “Our supply chain is very efficient with local suppliers, that’s the main reason we can be very competitive.” Nuctech’s successes abound. The company, which is opening offices in Brussels, Madrid and Rome, says it has supplied customers in more than 170 countries and regions. Nuctech said in 2019 that it had installed more than 1,000 security check devices in Europe for customs, civil aviation, ports and government organizations. In November 2020, Norwegian Customs put out a call to buy a new cargo scanner for the Svinesund checkpoint, a complex of squat, grey buildings at the Swedish border. An American rival and two other companies complained that the terms as written gave Nuctech a leg up. The specifications were rewritten, but Nuctech won the deal anyway. The Chinese company beat its rivals on both price and quality, said Jostein Engen, the customs agency’s director of procurement, and none of Norway’s government ministries raised red flags that would have disqualified Nuctech. “We in Norwegian Customs must treat Nuctech like everybody else in our competition,” Engen said. “We can’t do anything else following EU rules on public tenders.” Four of five NATO member states that border Russia — Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland — have purchased Nuctech equipment for their border crossings with Russia. So has Finland. Europe’s two largest ports — Rotterdam and Antwerp , which together handled more than a third of goods, by weight, entering and leaving the EU’s main ports in 2020 — use Nuctech devices, according to parliamentary testimony. Other key states at the edges of the EU, including the U.K., Turkey, Ukraine, Albania, Belarus and Serbia have also purchased Nuctech scanners, some of which were donated or financed with low-interest loans from Chinese state banks, according to public procurement documents and government announcements. Airports in London, Amsterdam, Brussels, Athens, Florence, Pisa, Venice, Zurich, Geneva and more than a dozen across Spain have all signed deals for Nuctech equipment, procurement and government documents, and corporate announcements show. Nuctech says it provided security equipment for the Olympics in Brazil in 2016, then President Donald Trump’s visit to China in 2017 and the World Economic Forum in 2020. It has also provided equipment to some U.N. organizations, procurement records show. RISING CONCERNS As Nuctech’s market share has grown, so too has skepticism about the company. Canadian authorities dropped a standing offer from Nuctech to provide X-ray scanning equipment at more than 170 Canadian diplomatic missions around the world after a government assessment found an “elevated threat” of espionage. Lithuania, which is involved in a diplomatic feud with China over Taiwan, blocked Nuctech from providing airport scanners earlier this year after a national security review found that it wasn’t possible for the equipment to operate in isolation and there was a risk information could leak back to China, according to Margiris Abukevicius, vice minister for international cooperation and cybersecurity at Lithuania’s Ministry of National Defense. Then, in August, Lithuania approved a deal for a Nuctech scanner on its border with Belarus. There were only two bidders, Nuctech and a Russian company — both of which presented national security concerns — and there wasn’t time to reissue the tender, two Lithuanian officials told AP. “It’s just an ad hoc decision choosing between bad and worse options,” Abukevicius said. He added that the government is developing a road map to replace all Nuctech scanners currently in use in Lithuania as well as a legal framework to ban purchases of untrusted equipment by government institutions and in critical sectors. Human rights concerns are also generating headwinds for Nuctech. The company does business with police and other authorities in Western China’s Xinjiang region, where Beijing stands accused of genocide for mass incarceration and abuse of minority Uighur Muslims. Despite pressure from U.S. and European policymakers on companies to stop doing business in Xinjiang, European governments have continued to award tens of millions of dollars in contracts — sometimes backed by European Union funds — to Nuctech. Nuctech says on its Chinese website that China’s western regions, including Xinjiang, are “are important business areas” for the company. It has signed multiple contracts to provide X-ray equipment to Xinjiang’s Department of Transportation and Public Security Department. It has provided license plate recognition devices for a police checkpoint in Xinjiang, Chinese government records show, and an integrated security system for the subway in Urumqi, the region’s capital city. It regularly showcases its security equipment at trade fairs in Xinjiang. “Companies like Nuctech directly enable Xinjiang’s high-tech police state and its intrusive ways of suppressing ethnic minorities. This should be taken into account when Western governments and corporations interface with Nuctech,” said Adrian Zenz, a researcher who has documented abuses in Xinjiang and compiled evidence of the company’s activities in the region. Nuctech’s Bos said he can understand those views, but that the company tries to steer clear of politics. “Our daily goal is to have equipment to secure the world more and better,” he said. “We don’t interfere with politics.” COMPLEX WEB OF OWNERSHIP Nuctech opened a factory in Poland in 2018 with the tagline “Designed in China and manufactured in Europe.” But ultimate responsibility for the company lies far from Warsaw, with the state-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council in Beijing, China’s top governing body. Nuctech’s ownership structure is so complex that can be difficult for outsiders to understand the true lines of influence and accountability. Scott Kennedy, a Chinese economic policy expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said that the ambiguous boundaries between the Communist Party, state companies and financial institutions in China — which have only grown murkier under China’s leader, Xi Jinping — can make it difficult to grasp how companies like Nuctech are structured and operate. “Consider if the roles were reversed. If the Chinese were acquiring this equipment for their airports they’d want a whole variety of assurances,” Kennedy said. “China has launched a high-tech self-sufficiency drive because they don’t feel safe with foreign technology in their supply chain.” What is clear is that Nuctech, from its very origins, has been tied to Chinese government, academic and military interests. Nuctech was founded as an offshoot of Tsinghua University, an elite public research university in Beijing. It grew with backing from the Chinese government and for years was run by the son of China’s former leader, Hu Jintao. Datenna, a Dutch economic intelligence company focused on China, mapped the ownership structure of Nuctech and found a dozen major entities across four layers of shareholding, including four state-owned enterprises and three government entities. Today the majority shareholder in Nuctech is Tongfang Co., which has a 71 percent stake. The largest shareholder in Tongfang, in turn, is the investment arm of the China National Nuclear Corp. (CNNC), a state-run energy and defense conglomerate controlled by China’s State Council. The U.S. Defense Department classifies CNNC as a Chinese military company because it shares advanced technologies and expertise with the People’s Liberation Army. Xi has further blurred the lines between China’s civilian and military activities and deepened the power of the ruling Communist Party within private enterprises. One way: the creation of dozens of government-backed financing vehicles designed to speed the development of technologies that have both military and commercial applications. In fact, one of those vehicles, the National Military-Civil Fusion Industry Investment Fund, announced in June 2020 that it wanted to take a 4.4 percent stake in Nuctech’s majority shareholder, along with the right to appoint a director to the Tongfang board. It never happened — “changes in the market environment,” Tongfeng explained in a Chinese stock exchange filing. But there are other links between Nuctech’s ownership structure and the fusion fund. CNNC, which has a 21 percent interest in Nuctech, holds a stake of more than 7 percent in the fund, according to Qichacha, a Chinese corporate information platform. They also share personnel: Chen Shutang, a member of CNNC’s Party Leadership Group and the company’s chief accountant serves as a director of the fund, records show. “The question here is whether or not we want to allow Nuctech, which is controlled by the Chinese state and linked to the Chinese military, to be involved in crucial parts of our border security and infrastructure,” said Jaap van Etten, a former Dutch diplomat and CEO of Datenna. Nuctech maintains that its operations are shaped by market forces, not politics, and says CNNC doesn’t control its corporate management or decision-making. “We are a normal commercial operator here in Europe which has to obey the laws,” said Nuctech’s Bos. “We work here with local staff members, we pay tax, contribute to the social community and have local suppliers.” But experts say these touchpoints are further evidence of the government and military interests encircling the company and show its strategic interest to Beijing. “Under Xi Jinping, the national security elements of the state are being fused with the technological and innovation dimensions of the state,” said Tai Ming Cheung, a professor at UC San Diego’s School of Global Policy and Strategy. “Military-civil fusion is one of the key battlegrounds between the U.S. and China. The Europeans will have to figure out where they stand.” ___ Associated Press researcher Chen Si in Shanghai and reporters Menelaos Hadjicostis in Nicosia, Cyprus, Aritz Parra in Madrid, Nina Bigalke in London, Nicholas Paphitis in Athens, Justin Spike in Budapest, Liudas Dapkus in Vilnius, Lithuania, Zeynep Bilginsoy in Istanbul and Barry Hatton in Lisbon contributed to this report.",western,1,2684,91.43,43.12,19.85,20.23,22,34.17,76.97,53.95,42.03,5.96,1.86,0.07,0.67,0.26,0.22,0.48,4.1,11.85,7.08,1.75,14.87,5.77,2.16,5.66,0.89,10.43,6.82,3.58,6.56,1.38,1.15,4.32,8.94,0.52,8.16,1.83,1.3,0.89,1.45,0.3,2.94,0,2.01,1.01,1.01,0.26,0,0.26,0.07,0.04,0,0,8.16,3.69,0.22,0.11,0.56,0.3,1.53,3.5,0.07,0,0,0.26,5.7,2.83,1.6,1.27,7.04,0.26,0.04,5.14,2.31,0.04,0.45,0.11,0.11,0,0,0,0,0,0.04,0.37,0.15,0.75,0.19,0,0,0.15,1.38,0.22,2.46,9.91,0.48,0.86,7.45,0.86,0.04,0.3,1.42,3.28,4.17,0.45,0.15,0.15,0.04,0,0,19.19,5.92,6.71,0,0,2.79,3.76

The US, UK and Germany are among those who told their nationals to leave. Moscow has amassed an estimated 100,000 troops along Ukraine's border but denies any intent to invade. In a phone call, US President Joe Biden again warned Russian leader Vladimir Putin of the costs of any invasion. For his part, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said invasion warnings could stoke panic, which he called ""the best friend of our enemies"". The White House has warned that an invasion could happen at any time, and could begin with bombing from the air. Russia characterised such allegations as ""provocative speculation"". Non-essential staff have been ordered to leave the US Embassy in Ukraine's capital Kyiv, and consular services will be suspended from Sunday, although ""a small consular presence"" will remain in the western city of Lviv ""to handle emergencies"". Canada is also moving its embassy staff to Lviv, near the border with Poland, Canadian media reported. UK ambassador to Ukraine Melinda Simmons tweeted that she and a ""core team"" are staying in Kyiv. Russia itself is also making changes, saying it will ""optimise the staffing"" of its diplomats in Ukraine, citing ""possible acts of provocation by the Kyiv regime or third countries"". The US has also pulled some 150 troops who were training Ukrainian soldiers out of the country, citing an abundance of caution. And Dutch airline KLM announced it would stop flying to Ukraine, effective immediately, Dutch media said. Mr Zelensky said that if Western powers had any firm evidence of an impending invasion, he had yet to see it. ""I think there is too much information in the media about a deep, full-scale war,"" he said. ""We understand all the risks, we understand that they exist. If you or someone else has additional 100% reliable information about the Russian Federation's invasion of Ukraine... please share it with us."" I’m staying in Ukraine, for now: Watch US citizen and English teacher Juan Tec explain why Many countries, including Australia, Italy, Israel, the Netherlands and Japan have told their citizens to leave Ukraine. Some have also evacuated diplomatic staff and their families. Mr Biden told Mr Putin that any invasion would result in ""swift and severe costs on Russia"", White House notes about the call said. ""While the United States remains prepared to engage in diplomacy... we are equally prepared for other scenarios,"" it said. The Kremlin described the call as taking place amid ""peak hysteria"" from the US and its allies, and said Mr Putin had again told his counterpart that they had not addressed Russia's security concerns. But both leaders would continue to talk, it said. French President Emmanuel Macron also spoke to Mr Putin by phone on Saturday, telling him that ""a sincere dialogue was not compatible with escalation"", according to notes released by the French embassy. With foreign embassies withdrawing staff and a host of countries now telling their citizens to leave Ukraine, Kyiv still doesn't feel like a city in crisis. The government here is telling people to stay calm and united and, in the words of a statement this morning, refrain from actions that undermine stability and sow panic. President Zelensky said the country had to be ready for any eventuality. Across Ukraine, foreign citizens are now making hurried plans. Stuart McKenzie, who's lived in Kyiv for 28 years and runs a successful business, hopes to get his wife and two sons out on a flight. But he is ready, if necessary, to pack the family into the car and drive 300 miles to Poland. He loves Ukraine and can't quite believe it's come to this. At the British Embassy, we found tight-lipped staff loading bags into a car and driving off. No-one seemed keen to talk. Not far to the north, across the border in Belarus, Russia's war games are now well under way. Russian defence ministry pictures, released this morning, showed multiple rocket launchers being fired. Moscow still says it has no plans to invade. But there's a lot the Russians can do without ever setting foot inside Ukraine. In Kyiv, several thousand people marched through the city on Saturday, chanting slogans pledging loyalty to Ukraine and resistance to any Russian invasion. The march was organised by a right-wing nationalist group called Gonor and anti-Zelensky far-right activist Sergiy Sternenko, but it attracted other people too. BBC reporter Eleanor Montague says the demonstration was not huge, but was the first significant manifestation of public feeling since tensions escalated, finishing at the Maidan, the city's most famous square. Sasha Nizelska, who works as a nanny in Kyiv, told the BBC that she would resist a Russian attack with all means in her power. The sentiment was repeated by people of all age groups attending the demonstration. Tensions have steadily increased as Russia has continued to deploy troops along Ukraine's eastern border. Russian troops are also staging military exercises in Belarus to the north, while naval exercises in the Sea of Azov in the south-east have led to accusations that Russia is blocking Ukraine's access to the sea. Meanwhile, some 7,500km (4,660 miles) away on Russia's eastern side, the Russian defence ministry says it spotted a US Navy submarine inside its territorial waters. Officials say the US submarine was near the Kuril Islands and failed to surface when instructed. The Marshal Shaposhnikov destroyer took unspecified ""appropriate"" actions and the US submarine left the area, the ministry said. A US defence official has been summoned by Moscow over the incident. However, US officials later contradicted their Russian counterparts' version of events. ""There is no truth to the Russian claims of our operations in their territorial waters,"" US military spokesman Captain Kyle Raines said in a statement carried by Reuters. ""I will not comment on the precise location of our submarines but we do fly, sail, and operate safely in international waters.""",western,1,1000,85.85,72.8,41.95,11.97,18.87,27.8,80.8,59.1,46.3,7.7,4.4,0.3,1.5,0.1,1.2,0.9,3.3,14.1,7.8,1.3,13.7,6.4,3.4,5.4,1,13.9,5.4,3.4,8.4,2.8,0.8,4.9,8.7,0.7,7.9,1.6,0.9,1.1,2,0,2.9,0,3.5,1.3,2.1,0.6,0.3,0.2,0.2,0,0,0,14.8,6.9,0.5,0.7,0.6,0.2,4.7,8.3,0.4,0.2,0.4,1.7,6.1,3.9,1.8,0.4,2.9,0.1,0.2,2.2,0.3,0.2,0.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.5,0.1,0.4,0.2,0.1,0,0.1,0.9,0,4.1,12.4,0.7,1.8,9.1,0.6,0,0.4,3.6,4.9,3.9,1.2,0.1,0.1,0,0,0,17.8,5.7,6.1,0,0,1.6,4.4
791,apnews.com,2022-02-02 08:00:00,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-russia-united-sates-europe-linda-thomas-greenfield-fc3d700af4518e643ce520ba066a4885,"Russia , US exchange accusations over Ukraine at UN",English,United States,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Russia accused the West on Monday of “whipping up tensions” over Ukraine and said the U.S. had brought “pure Nazis” to power in Kyiv as the U.N. Security Council held a stormy and bellicose debate on Moscow’s troop buildup near its southern neighbor. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield shot back that Russia’s growing military force of more than 100,000 troops along Ukraine’s borders was “the largest mobilization” in Europe in decades, adding that there has been a spike in cyberattacks and Russian disinformation. “And they are attempting, without any factual basis, to paint Ukraine and Western countries as the aggressors to fabricate a pretext for attack,” she said. The harsh exchanges in the Security Council came as Moscow lost an attempt to block the meeting and reflected the gulf between the two nuclear powers. It was the first open session where all protagonists in the Ukraine crisis spoke publicly, even though the U.N.’s most powerful body took no action. Hours later, the Russian government sent a written response to a U.S. proposal aimed at deescalating the crisis, according to three Biden administration officials. The officials all spoke on the condition of anonymity. A State Department official declined to offer details of the response, saying it “would be unproductive to negotiate in public” and that they would leave it up to Russia to discuss the counterproposal. Although more high-level diplomacy is expected this week, talks between the U.S. and Russia have so far failed to ease tensions in the crisis, with the West saying Moscow is preparing for an invasion. Russia denies it is planning to attack. It demands pledges that Ukraine will never join NATO, a halt to the deployment of NATO weapons near Russian borders and a rollback of the alliance’s forces from Eastern Europe. NATO and the U.S. call those nonstarters. Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia accused the U.S. of interfering in his country’s internal affairs and seeking “a classic example of megaphone diplomacy.” Thomas-Greenfield countered that the U.S. has held over 100 private meetings in the past few weeks with Russian officials and European and Ukrainian colleagues and “it’s now time” for a discussion in public. To Russia’s assertion that the U.S. called the meeting to make all council members feel uncomfortable, she retorted, “Imagine how uncomfortable you would be if you had 100,000 troops sitting on your border.” After the council gave a green light for the meeting, Nebenzia accused the Biden administration of “whipping up tensions and rhetoric and provoking escalation.” “You are almost pulling for this,” he said in his speech to the council, looking at Thomas-Greenfield. “You want it to happen. You’re waiting for it to happen, as if you want to make your words become a reality.” He blamed the U.S. for the 2014 ouster of a Kremlin-friendly president in Kyiv, saying it brought to power “nationalists, radicals, Russophobes and pure Nazis” and created the antagonism that exists between Ukraine and Russia. Nebenzia pointedly left the council chamber as the Ukrainian Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya started to speak. “How long Russia will pressure, will pursue a clear attempt to push Ukraine and its partners into a Kafka trap?” Kyslytsva asked. The vote on holding an open meeting passed 10-2, with Russia and China opposed, and India, Gabon and Kenya abstaining. Nine “yes” votes were needed for the meeting to go ahead. The U.S. and its allies had pressed to hold the meeting Monday, the last day of Norway’s rotating presidency of the council, before Russia takes over Tuesday for the month of February. Any statement or resolution by the Security Council is extremely unlikely, given Russia’s veto power and its ties with others on the council, including China. After all 15 council members spoke, the U.S. and Russia sparred again, with Thomas-Greenfield saying she was “disappointed” in Nebenzia’s comments, stressing that Russian threats of aggression are “provocative.” U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement that the meeting was “a critical step in rallying the world to speak out in one voice” to reject the use of force and seek military de-escalation. At the start of a White House meeting with the ruling emir of Qatar, Biden said the U.S. continues to engage in “nonstop diplomacy,” but “we are ready no matter what happens.” The State Department on Monday ordered the departure of families of American diplomats in Belarus, where Russia is deploying troops, tanks and other materiel in what Moscow says is a military exercise. Western officials fear Russia’s troop buildup could use Belarus as a jumping-off point to invade neighboring Ukraine, especially its capital, Kyiv, from the north. Tens of thousands of other Russian troops already are staged elsewhere along Ukraine’s borders. Belarus officials already have pushed most U.S. Embassy staff out of the country, leaving fewer family members to be affected by Monday’s order. The U.S. has also drawn down its diplomatic presence in Ukraine. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken are expected to speak by phone Tuesday, according to the Russian Foreign Ministry. A senior State Department official confirmed the Russian account. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will visit Ukraine on Tuesday for talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and will also speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin to urge him to “step back,” Johnson’s office said. Johnson says he is considering sending hundreds of British troops to NATO countries in the Baltic region as a show of strength. Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. Congress said Monday they were still divided over some of the timing in draft sanctions legislation against Russia. A Republican push to impose sanctions on a Russian natural gas pipeline to Germany, Nord Stream 2, even before any new Russian push into Ukraine was a main sticking point, lawmakers said. The Biden administration argues for waiting after any invasion, saying sanctioning Nord Stream now could alienate an ally, Germany, and remove the deterrence power of that sanctions threat. On Sunday, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Bob Menendez, said that in the event of an attack, lawmakers want Russia to face “the mother of all sanctions.” That includes actions against Russian banks that could severely undermine the Russian economy and increased lethal aid  to Ukraine’s military. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday the administration was encouraged by the bipartisan effort in Congress “to hold Russia accountable.” The administration has previously expressed concern that preemptive sanctions could diminish their leverage on Russia, but the White House sounded warmer to the prospect as the Foreign Relations Committee moves to act. “Our view is that sanctions can be an effective tool of deterrence, and the deepening sell-off in Russian markets reflects our message to Russia,” Psaki said ___ Associated Press writers Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow, Aamer Madhani, Matthew Lee and Ellen Knickmeyer in Washington and Jill Lawless in London contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP stories on the crisis in Ukraine at: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",western,1,1164,96.95,67.72,13.78,2.88,23.28,31.44,80.5,55.24,42.78,5.41,2.23,0,0.26,0.86,0.77,0.34,3.18,14.6,9.54,1.2,15.81,4.38,1.98,5.15,0.26,11.86,4.98,2.58,8.76,2.06,0.6,5.93,5.93,0.77,5.07,0.69,1.29,1.03,0.69,0.09,1.2,0,3.52,0.52,3.01,0.95,0,0.95,0.17,0.34,0.09,0,13.66,7.82,0.77,0.09,1.37,0.43,4.55,5.07,0.17,0.09,0.34,0.52,8.59,6.27,1.89,0.43,4.98,0,0.43,4.38,0.34,0,0.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.09,0.52,0.26,0.17,0,0,0,0,0.77,0.09,2.84,9.97,0.17,1.63,6.87,0.86,0.09,0.43,3.52,4.55,2.84,1.03,0.34,0.26,0.09,0,0,19.93,7.39,5.07,0.09,0,1.46,5.93

Evan Neumann of Mill Valley, California, acknowledged in an interview with the Belarus 1 channel that he was at the Capitol that day but rejected the charges, which include assaulting police, obstruction and other offenses. The channel aired excerpts of the interview on Sunday and Monday, and promised to release the full version on Wednesday. “I don’t think I have committed some kind of a crime,” said Neumann, 48, according to a Belarus 1 voiceover of his interview remarks. “One of the charges was very offensive; it alleges that I hit a police officer. It doesn’t have any grounds to it.” Neumann spoke in English but was barely audible under the dubbed Russian. Both Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin have used the Jan. 6 riot as a way to accuse the U.S. of a double standard in criticizing other countries, including Russia and Belarus, for cracking down on antigovernment protests Belarus was rocked by months of protests after election officials gave Lukashenko a sixth term in the 2020 balloting that the opposition and the West have denounced as a sham. The government unleashed a violent crackdown on the protesters, arresting more than 35,000 people and badly beating thousands of them. The crackdown elicited widespread international outrage. Putin likewise has come under criticism from the West over the imprisonment of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, the detention of thousands of demonstrators protesting his arrest, and the outlawing of Navalny’s organizations as extremist. In an interview with NBC in June, Putin suggested that the hundreds of people arrested for rioting at the U.S. Capitol were being subjected to “persecution for political opinions.” U.S. court documents state that Neumann stood at the front of a police barricade wearing a red “Make America Great Again” hat as supporters of President Donald Trump tried to force past officers. Prosecutors say Neumann taunted and screamed at the police before putting a gas mask over his face and threatened one officer, saying police would be “overrun” by the crowd. “I’m willing to die, are you?” prosecutors quoted Neumann saying to the officer. Police body camera footage shows Neumann and others shoving a metal barricade into a line of officers who were trying to push the crowd back before he punched two officers with his fist and then hit them with the barricade, according to court papers. Neumann was identified by investigators after someone who said they were a family friend called an FBI tip line with Neumann’s name and hometown. He was charged in a U.S. federal criminal complaint, meaning a judge agreed that investigators presented sufficient probable cause that Neumann had committed the crimes. Messages left for family members of Neumann in Northern California were not returned Tuesday. Neumann is one of more than 650 people who have been charged for their actions on Jan. 6, when pro-Trump rioters attacked the Capitol building and delayed Congress’ certification of Joe Biden’s Electoral College victory. Neumann told Belarus 1 that his photo had been added to the FBI’s most wanted list, after which he left the country under the pretense of a business trip. Neuman, who owns a handbag manufacturing business, traveled to Italy in March, and then through Switzerland, Germany and Poland before arriving in Ukraine and spent several months there. He said he decided to illegally cross into neighboring Belarus after he noticed surveillance by Ukraine’s security forces. “It is awful. It is political persecution,” Neumann told the TV channel. Belarusian border guards detained him when he tried to cross into the country in mid-August, and he requested asylum in Belarus. Belarus doesn’t have an extradition treaty with the U.S. “We’ve seen Belarusian state media reporting about this individual Evan Newman,” State Department spokesman Ned Price said in Washington. “Due to U.S. privacy laws, we’re limited in what we can say about individual U.S. citizens,” he added, and referred questions to the Justice Department, which said it doesn’t comment “on the existence or nonexistence of requests for apprehension to foreign governments.” The Belarus 1 anchors described Neumann as a “simple American, whose stores were burned down by members of the Black Lives Matter movement, who was seeking justice, asking inconvenient questions, but lost almost everything and is being persecuted by the U.S. government.” In a short preface to the interview, the Belarus 1 reporter also said that “something” made Neumann “flee from the country of fairytale freedoms and opportunities” — an apparent reference to the U.S., which has levied multiple sanctions against Belarus over human rights abuses and its violent crackdown on dissent. —- Associated Press writer Mike Balsamo in Washington contributed.",western,1,813,94.2,64.07,14.03,1.64,23.23,33.09,80.2,55.23,44.4,7.75,4.31,0.49,0.37,0.12,1.97,0.49,3.44,13.9,9.47,2.46,15.38,5.29,1.35,5.66,0.62,11.32,4.43,3.44,8.73,0.86,0.98,7.01,6.89,0.12,6.27,0.98,0.86,0.62,1.35,0.25,2.21,0,4.55,0.74,3.81,0.86,0,0.86,0.12,0.49,0,0,14.76,7.5,0.12,0.25,1.97,1.23,3.81,6.89,0,0,0,2.09,5.9,4.8,0.86,0.25,3.69,0.25,0.25,2.71,0.62,0.12,0.62,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.12,0,0.12,0,0.49,0.25,0,0.12,0.49,0,2.58,9.1,0.37,1.48,6.52,0.62,0.25,0.12,3.08,6.03,2.34,0,0,0,0,0,0,17.47,6.64,5.04,0.12,0,1.72,3.94

",English,United States,"MOSCOW (AP) — A peace agreement for the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine that has never quite ended is back in the spotlight amid a Russian military buildup near the country’s borders and rising tensions about whether Moscow will invade. Top officials from Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany are meeting Thursday in Berlin to discuss ways of implementing the deal that was signed in Belarusian capital Minsk in 2015. Here is a look at the document’s key points and the contested issues regarding its implementation: CONFLICT IN THE EAST Russia responded to the February 2014 ouster in Kyiv of a Kremlin-friendly president by annexing Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula and backing a separatist insurgency in the country’s mostly Russian-speaking eastern industrial region known as the Donbas. Ukrainian troops and volunteer battalions engaged in ferocious and devastating battles with the rebels involving heavy artillery, armor and combat aircraft. Ukraine and the West accused Russia of backing separatists with troops and weapons. Moscow rejected the accusations, saying that any Russians who fought in the east were volunteers. Amid the fighting, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014, killing all 298 people aboard. An international investigation concluded the jetliner was destroyed by a missile fired from a rebel-controlled area. It said the weapon was brought into Ukraine from a military base in Russia, but Moscow categorically denied any involvement. Leaders of France and Germany began efforts to negotiate a truce in talks with Russia and Ukraine when they met in Normandy, France, in June 2014, in what became known as the Normandy format. FIGHTING AND NEGOTIATIONS After a massive defeat of Ukrainian troops in August 2014, representatives from Kyiv and the rebels signed a truce in Minsk in September 2014. The document, dubbed Minsk I, envisaged a cease-fire monitored by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a pullback of foreign fighters, an exchange of prisoners and hostages, an amnesty for the insurgents and a promise that rebel regions could have a degree of self-government. The agreement collapsed quickly and large-scale battles resumed. In January and February of 2015, Ukrainian troops suffered another major defeat in the battle of Debaltseve. France and Germany moved quickly to help broker another peace agreement, and on Feb. 12, 2015, representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the rebels signed a deal that envisaged a new cease-fire, a pullback of heavy weapons from the line of contact between the troops and the rebels, and provisions for a political settlement. A declaration in support of the deal was signed by the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany. MINSK DEAL PROVISIONS The deal, dubbed Minsk II, included an OSCE-monitored cease-fire, a pullback of heavy weapons and foreign fighters from the line of contact and an exchange of prisoners. In a major diplomatic coup for Russia, the document obliged Ukraine to grant special status to the separatist regions, allowing them to create their own police force and have a say in appointing local prosecutors and judges. It also required Kyiv to offer a sweeping amnesty for the separatists and negotiate details of holding local elections with rebel leaders. It stipulated that Ukraine could only regain control over the border with Russia in rebel regions after they get self-rule and hold OSCE-monitored local elections — balloting that would almost certainly keep pro-Moscow rebels in power there. In another gain for the Kremlin, the document didn’t contain any obligations on the part of Russia, which insisted it’s not a party to the conflict and cast it as part of Ukraine’s internal affairs. Many in Ukraine resented the deal, seeing it as a betrayal of national interests and a blow to the country’s integrity. The widespread public dismay has effectively blocked the deal’s implementation. MOSCOW AND KYIV TRADE BLAME While the Minsk deal helped end large-scale battles, frequent skirmishes have continued, with both sides blaming each other. The parties have negotiated a long series of renewed cease-fires, but all have been quickly violated. Ukraine has accused Russia of failing to withdraw its troops from the conflict areas. Moscow has staunchly denied their presence there and pointed to the deployment of Western military instructors in Ukraine. While denying any military involvement in eastern Ukraine, Russia has offered political and economic support to the rebels and granted citizenship to more than 700,000 residents of the region. The leaders of Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany pledged adherence to the Minsk agreement when they last met in Paris in December 2019 but made no visible progress. MORE TALKS Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has pushed for another four-way summit, but the Kremlin said it would serve no purpose until Ukraine agrees to abide by the deal’s obligations. Amid soaring tensions over the Russian military buildup near Ukraine, France and Germany have intensified their efforts to broker more four-way talks on the conflict in the east, seeing that as a possible way to ease tensions in the larger crisis. Representatives from the four countries met in Paris on Jan. 26, securing no progress but they agreed to hold the session in Berlin on Thursday, with a goal to agree on a common interpretation of the Minsk agreements. French President Emmanuel Macron sought to revive the Minsk deal during his visits to Moscow and Kyiv this week, describing it as “the only path allowing to build peace ... and find a sustainable political solution.” THE PRESSURE ON UKRAINE Facing Western calls for the implementation of the Minsk deal, Ukrainian officials have become increasingly critical of the document. Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, told The Associated Press last week the deal was signed “under a Russian gun barrel,” and warned that “the fulfillment of the Minsk agreement means the country’s destruction.” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba argued that Moscow aims to use the deal to have the rebel regions reintegrated into Ukraine and use them to block the country’s pro-Western aspirations, vowing: “This is not going to happen.” Zelenskyy was more diplomatic but noted that he dislikes every point of the Minsk document, a comment that drew a taunting and crude remark from Russian President Vladimir Putin. “Like it or not, you have to bear with it, my beauty,” Putin quipped, using a coarse verse from Russian folklore. “You have to fulfill it. It will not work otherwise.”",western,1,1055,97.66,37.34,33.87,5.43,24.53,31.56,77.06,54.12,44.17,4.74,1.52,0.19,0,0.19,0.19,0.85,3.22,15.55,11.18,1.71,15.73,3.51,1.61,6.45,0.85,8.63,4.93,2.94,9.48,1.14,1.52,6.82,7.11,0.85,6.16,0.85,0.95,0.47,0.85,0.19,2.65,0,5.78,1.99,3.79,0.57,0,0.57,0,0.28,0,0,10.43,7.39,0.95,0.28,2.27,0.66,2.27,3.03,0,0,0,0.19,3.98,2.56,1.42,0,3.7,0.19,0.19,3.22,0.38,0,0.09,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.09,0.66,0.09,0.28,0,0.19,0,0.19,0.47,0.19,2.27,10.52,0.38,0.66,8.53,0.38,0,0.57,3.6,3.89,1.52,0.76,0.09,0,0.09,0,0,14.03,4.27,5.4,0,0,1.23,3.13
800,apnews.com,2022-02-06 08:00:00,https://apnews.com/98f0ae4d7dcf539094d67c8dd9b90e23,Officials : Russia at 70 percent of Ukraine military buildup,English,United States,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Russia has assembled at least 70 percent of the military firepower it likely intends to have in place by mid-month to give President Vladimir Putin the option of launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, U.S. officials say. The officials, who discussed internal assessments of the Russian buildup on condition they not be identified, sketched out a series of indicators suggesting Putin intends an invasion in coming weeks, although the size and scale are unclear. They stressed that a diplomatic solution appears to remain possible. Among those military indicators: an exercise of Russia’s strategic nuclear forces that usually is held each fall was rescheduled for mid-February to March. That coincides with what U.S. officials see as the most likely window for invasion. The officials made no suggestion that a prospective conflict would involve the use of nuclear weapons, but the Russian exercise — likely involving the test-launching of unarmed long-range missiles on Russian territory — could be used as a message aimed at deterring the West from intervening in Ukraine. U.S. officials have said in recent weeks that a Russian invasion could overwhelm Ukraine’s military relatively quickly, although Moscow might find it difficult to sustain an occupation and cope with a potential insurgency. The ongoing Russian buildup comes as the Biden administration has been disclosing intelligence in hopes of preemptively countering Russian disinformation and blocking Putin’s plans for creating a pretext for an invasion. But it has come under criticism for not providing evidence to back up many of its claims. On Saturday, The New York Times and The Washington Post said officials were warning that a full Russian invasion could lead to the quick capture of Kyiv and potentially result in as many as 50,000 casualties. A U.S. official confirmed that estimate to The Associated Press. But it’s not clear how U.S. agencies determined those numbers, and any predictions about how an invasion would proceed and the human cost it would inflict are inherently uncertain given the vagaries of war. President Joe Biden has said he will not send U.S. troops to Ukraine to fight a war. He has, however, ordered additional forces, including headquarters personnel and combat troops, to Poland and Romania to reassure those NATO allies that Washington would fulfill its treaty commitment to respond to Russian aggression against NATO territory. Ukraine is not a NATO member but receives U.S. and allied military support and training. Army officials on Saturday announced that Maj. Gen. Christopher Donahue, the commanding general of the 82nd Airborne Division, arrived in Poland. About other 1,700 soldiers from the 82nd Airborne are deploying to Poland from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and 300 soldiers are deploying from Bragg to Germany. In addition, 1,000 Germany-based soldiers are shifting to Romania. With growing nervousness in Eastern Europe over Russia’s buildup, much attention is focused on its placement of thousands of troops in Belarus, which shares a border not only with Ukraine but also with three NATO nations — Poland, Lithuania and Latvia. The Biden administration may soon shift some more troops within Europe to allied nations on NATO’s eastern flank, a U.S. official said Saturday without specifying which nations. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said last week that Putin could use any portion of the force he has assembled along Ukraine’s borders to seize Ukrainian cities and “significant territories” or to carry out “coercive acts or provocative political acts” like the recognition of breakaway territories inside Ukraine. More recently, other U.S. officials provided a more detailed breakdown of Russia’s continuing force buildup, of U.S. assessments of prospects for war, and of the U.S. view of Putin’s approach to the crisis. The officials reiterated what other Biden administration officials have been saying for weeks — that they don’t believe Putin has made a final decision to invade Ukraine. But it appears possible that the Russian leader set his intentions and is waiting until the last moment to give the go-ahead for an invasion. Officials sketched out the disposition of Russian forces that have been deployed toward Ukraine’s borders over the past several months, creating what Western officials see as the threat of a full-scale invasion despite repeated assertions by senior Russian officials that they do not intend to attack unprovoked. As of Friday, the officials said, the Russian army has put in place near Ukraine a total of 83 “battalion tactical groups,” each of which is roughly equivalent in size to an American battalion of between 750 and 1,000 soldiers. That is an increase from 60 battalion tactical groups in position just two weeks ago, they said. Another 14 battalion tactical groups are on their way to the border area from other parts of Russia, the officials said. Two officials said the U.S. assesses that Russia would want a total of between 110 and 130 battalion tactical groups for use in a full-scale invasion, but Putin could decide on a more limited incursion. Including support units, Russia might be aiming to have 150,000 troops in place for a full-scale invasion, one official said, adding that the ongoing buildup could reach that level in the next couple of weeks. Depending on Putin’s ultimate objective, the Russian forces could attack Kyiv directly by moving south from current positions in southern Belarus. He might also send forces across the Russian border into eastern and southern Ukraine if his intent is to fracture and destroy a large portion of the Ukrainian army, the officials said. On the lower end of the scale of military action, Putin might order sabotage, cyberattacks and other destabilizing actions inside Ukraine with the goal of removing the current government in Kyiv, officials have said. ___ Associated Press writer Nomaan Merchant contributed to this report.",western,1,943,95.65,32.89,44.75,7.72,26.19,33.09,83.03,57.05,44.54,5.41,1.38,0,0,0,0.64,0.64,4.03,14.32,8.48,2.12,16.33,5.94,1.8,4.67,0.95,11.56,6.26,4.88,10.29,0.85,1.17,8.48,12.3,0.11,12.2,1.48,2.65,1.48,2.86,0,3.82,0,3.08,0.85,2.23,0.53,0.11,0.42,0.32,0.11,0,0,8.48,4.98,0.64,0.11,0.95,0,2.23,3.5,0,0,0,0.64,6.15,4.03,1.8,0.32,1.8,0,0.11,1.59,0.21,0,0.21,0.11,0,0,0.11,0,0,0,0.11,0.11,0.21,0.21,0,0.21,0,0.11,0.32,0.21,2.23,11.13,0.53,1.38,9.12,0.53,0,0,3.71,3.08,3.61,1.48,0,0,0,0,0,14.63,6.36,4.67,0,0,1.27,2.33
197,bbc.co.uk,2022-02-11 08:00:00,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-60355311,Russia - Ukraine crisis : united kingdom nationals told to leave Ukraine,English,United Kingdom,"British nationals in Ukraine are being told to leave the country now while commercial means are still available. The UK Foreign Office's warning came as the US said that Russia could invade ""any day now"" and told its own citizens to leave in the next 48 hours. Russia has denied any plans to invade Ukraine despite massing more than 100,000 troops near the border. Boris Johnson said he feared for the security of Europe as he joined a call of world leaders on Friday. Mr Johnson urged allies to have a ""heavy package of economic sanctions ready to go"" should Russia make the ""devastating and destructive decision"" to invade Ukraine, Downing Street said. Armed forces minister James Heappey said the advice to Britons in Ukraine had changed because Russia was at a stage where it could attack ""at no notice"". Mr Heappey told BBC Breakfast: ""We are now confident that the artillery systems, the missile systems and the combat air are all in place that would allow Russia to launch - at no notice - an attack on Ukraine."" And he warned that the Royal Air Force would not be ""in a position"" to go in and fly people out at a later date if they remained in the country. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Russia was in the position ""to be able to mount a major military operation in Ukraine any day now"" and it could start with an intense aerial bombing. But he stressed the US did not know whether President Vladimir Putin had made a final decision. However, Tobias Ellwood, Conservative MP and chair of the defence select committee, has raised concerns about the rhetoric being used by Washington, saying it was ""bordering on panic"". Mr Ellwood told the BBC's Newsnight programme: ""Absolutely, you've got a duty of care to your citizens, particularly when the threat picture does change. ""But it's almost bordering on panic and that absolutely fits into Putin's objective. He'll be delighted to see the West and the Nato alliance crumbling in this way."" He said a division of Nato should have been moved into Ukraine months ago, adding: ""The least we can do now is provide a no fly zone."" Russia's foreign ministry has accused Western countries of spreading false information. The Foreign Office, which also now advises against all travel to Ukraine, estimates there are a few thousand British nationals in Ukraine. It said that, due to this increased threat, further embassy staff would be withdrawn from Kyiv - although the embassy would remain open but would be unable to provide in-person consular assistance to any Britons who remain. A UK government source said the safety of Britons was the ""number one priority"" and said the decision was ""the right precaution to take"". Stuart McKenzie, a British man who has lived in the country for 28 years with his Ukrainian wife and children, told BBC Breakfast he was considering options for leaving. ""Any parent wouldn't want to put their children into any danger whatsoever,"" he said. ""There seem to be more and more threats, and we hear as soon as next week we could have Russian troops in the country."" Mr McKenzie is considering driving to the border with Poland, but said he was concerned about access to fuel, food, hotels, and cashpoints, as well as the poor weather conditions on the roads. ""These things can get out of control very fast and we've got to be on the right side of the chaos, to think of a border with a million cars and panic happening would be disastrous,"" he said. He also requested that the government open a hotline to give people practical advice on travel options. Several other countries have also advised their nationals to leave the country, including the Netherlands, Japan and South Korea. It comes after Moscow began massive military drills with neighbouring Belarus. These are believed to be Russia's largest deployment to Belarus since the Cold War. France called the drills a ""violent gesture"", while Ukraine said they amounted to ""psychological pressure"". Ukraine has also accused Russia of blocking its access to the sea. Both French President Emmanuel Macron and US President Joe Biden are due to speak with Mr Putin on Saturday. Russia is in a position to ""mount a major military action"" says US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan Speaking from the White House, Mr Sullivan warned there were signs of Russian escalation including new forces arriving at the Ukrainian border and said an invasion could include a ""rapid assault on the city of Kyiv"" or on other parts of the country. He said if a Russian invasion proceeded it was likely ""to begin with aerial bombing and missile attacks that could obviously kill civilians without regard to their nationality"". This could lead to communications being severed and commercial transit being halted, he said. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Friday that ""an invasion could begin at any time, and to be clear, that includes during the Olympics"". The Winter Olympics in China are scheduled to end on 20 February. The US also said it was sending a further 3,000 troops to Poland, and that they were expected to arrive there next week. The troops will not fight in Ukraine, but will ensure the defence of US allies. The current tensions come eight years after Russia annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula. Since then, Ukraine's military has been locked in a war with Russian-backed rebels in eastern areas near Russia's borders. The Kremlin says it cannot accept that Ukraine - a former Soviet republic with deep social and cultural ties with Russia - could one day join the Western defence alliance Nato and has demanded that this be ruled out. Earlier on Friday, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace met his Russian counterpart Sergei Shoigu and said at a news conference that an invasion of Ukraine would have ""tragic consequences"" for both countries. Mr Wallace said Russian forces were in the position to invade ""at any time"" but said Mr Shoigu had given him security assurances. Speaking to the BBC, Lord Darroch, a former British ambassador to the US and national security adviser, said the build-up could be an attempt by Russia to raise pressure and extract concessions from the West and Ukraine, but added there were not ""any new messages… the West can give to Russia"" to de-escalate the situation.",western,1,1062,86.25,64.01,37,5.49,24.14,25.52,84.46,63.84,47.83,6.59,3.39,0,0.94,0.19,1.51,0.56,3.2,14.03,8.66,0.94,14.03,8.47,3.01,5.93,0.85,17.61,6.4,3.2,7.25,2.17,0.47,4.61,10.55,0.47,9.98,1.41,1.6,2.35,1.69,0.47,2.82,0,3.95,1.04,2.82,0.94,0.19,0.66,0.47,0.09,0.09,0,14.31,7.91,0.94,0.94,1.41,0.28,4.24,6.59,0.19,0,0.09,2.35,4.99,3.3,1.6,0.09,2.07,0.19,0.19,1.41,0.28,0,0.47,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.28,0.09,0,0.09,0.56,0,0,0,0,1.41,0,4.99,11.39,0.56,2.26,8.29,0.28,0.09,0.28,5.37,6.59,3.95,0.75,0.19,0,0.19,0,0,15.07,4.24,3.86,0,0,1.22,5.74

",English,Russia,"On Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky implicitly threatened to revise Ukraine’s non-nuclear weapons state status, telling attendees of the Munich Security Conference that Kiev could pull out of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum – which committed the country to give up its massive Soviet-era arsenal of nukes. Ukraine would risk becoming an international pariah if it attempted to rejoin the nuclear club; at the same time, President Zelensky’s threats may be a bluff, since it is far from certain whether his country has the technical and material capabilities to build such weapons, observers tell Sputnik. Presto Pariah State “Ukraine’s non-nuclear status is determined by its participation in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which it joined in 1994. In accordance with that agreement, only countries which developed and tested nuclear weapons are allowed to possess nuclear weapons. Ukraine is not among these countries,"" points out Alexander Umarov, editor-in-chief of the nuclear power industry portal AtomInfo. If Ukraine went ahead with a secret attempt to develop nukes, without withdrawing from the NPT, the International Atomic Energy Agency would quickly identify evidence of military-related nuclear activity, and inform its board of governors. “They, in turn, will submit their prepared report or reports to the UN Security Council, which has the widest powers when it comes to coercing states, including international sanctions and even the use of force,” Umarov says. If Ukraine goes the other route and withdraws from the NPT, which is its legal right to do, this too will become the subject of a Security Council review, and again mean the threat of sanctions or UN military intervention, the observer notes. On top of that, Umarov notes, the world’s leading suppliers of nuclear technologies are united into the ‘Nuclear Suppliers Group’ – a group of nuclear supplier countries working to prevent nuclear proliferation and implementing a multilateral export control regime which bans cooperation with nuclear states that aren’t parties to the NPT. “In the event of a withdrawal from the NPT, Ukraine will be forced to stop the operation of its nuclear power plants, since it is completely dependent on the import of nuclear fuel, which may be terminated after its exit from the treaty,” Umarov warns. “Attempts to create a nuclear bomb will undoubtedly lead to Ukraine being in a much worse situation than it is today, and the country will fall into international isolation,” the observer sums up. Nuclear No-Go Kiev gave up a nuclear arsenal of as many as 3,000 nuclear weapons in the mid-1990s after signing the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances together with Belarus and Kazakhstan (which also gave up their nuke stockpiles), plus Russia, the United States and the United Kingdom. A significant detail, and one rarely brought up by today’s Ukrainian political elites, is that Kiev, Minsk and Astana never had operational control over their nuclear forces – with the launch codes to the weapons remaining under Russia’s control after the collapse of the Soviet Union. “Ukraine could not have prevented the removal of nuclear weapons by the Russian military, and is in no position to acquire them now,” says Dr. Mark Gubrud, an adjunct professor of peace, war and defence studies at the University of North Carolina. “Western countries and particularly the US would condemn such statements or ambitions by Ukraine. The technical capability to carry out a nuclear weapons development programme is not the issue; it is the political and military repercussions of attempting to do so,” Gubrud notes. ‘Propagandistic Gesture’ “I think it would be a mistake to say that this is unequivocally a Ukrainian decision. I think it is not an exaggeration to say that Ukraine is a country with limited sovereignty and that its foreign policy decisions are not necessarily its own,” says Dr. Srdja Trifkovic, a Serbian-American publicist, historian and foreign affairs editor for the Chronicles magazine. Trifkovic doesn’t believe that Zelensky would have brought up the Budapest Memorandum in his speech “had it not been cleared in advance with Ukraine’s sponsors and Western mentors.” “Having said this, it will be interesting to observe their reaction, because of course, Ukraine's decision to join the Non-Proliferation Treaty back in 1994 was loudly hailed as a major step towards nuclear non-proliferation, and Ukraine was widely praised for taking it. The practical question, whether Ukraine has the technical ability to reverse the non-proliferation course is frankly open to doubt. I don't think that it has either the know-how or the ready technical expertise and wherewithal, as well as the materials to build a nuclear weapon in a short period of time,” Trifkovic says. The observer thinks that Zelensky’s remarks constitute “more of a propagandistic gesture” meant to “add to the anti-Russian hysteria” of “poor little Ukraine [being] forced even to give up on its non-nuclear status because it feels existentially threatened by the aggressive dictator in the Kremlin and so on and so on.” Andrzej Zapalowski, a former Polish lawmaker, MEP and academic specializing in security affairs, agrees. “This is just a form of pressure – an attempt to make a political statement on the issue of Kiev’s admission to NATO. This is a game oriented, on the one hand, toward the West, and on the other, toward Ukrainian society… How can it end? The right to nuclear weapons? In reality, President Zelensky does not have an opportunity to gather the other signatories of the Budapest Memorandum together. Ukraine does not have the ability to produce these weapons. It would constitute an act of international adventurism,” Zapalowski says. Dirty Bomb? Ukraine might not be in possession of the technology for the full cycle of capability necessary for creating weapons grade uranium or plutonium, but could create a nuclear “dirty bomb” if it wanted, says Vladimir Zharikhin, deputy director of the Moscow-based Institute of CIS Studies. “They have uranium, of course. They have spent fuel rods from their nuclear power plants. They could make a so-called ‘dirty bomb’, that is – not a charge capable of producing a nuclear explosion, but a charge for spreading nuclear contamination. They can do it,” Zharikhin says.  Actually going ahead with such a mad idea is another matter entirely, the observer stresses. If, for the sake of argument, Ukraine did somehow manage to obtain nukes, this would come to constitute a massive threat to European and global security, Srdja Trifkovic believes. “First of all, what would be the chain of command and control? Because we've seen over the past eight years ever since the Maidan events that the government in Kiev does not have full control over the entire spectrum of the armed units in Ukraine. That in fact, some of the more extreme ones have always been able to evade government control and to behave as effectively an entity in its own right and with its own agenda,” the observer notes. “Now these elements in Ukraine, if the government has not been able to bring them under control over the past eight years, the question arises as to who could guarantee that if Ukraine does rebuild its nuclear arsenal, it would indeed be in adult hands,” Trifkovic warns. Poker Face Aitech Bizhev, retired deputy commander in chief of the Russian Air Force-CIS Joint Air Defence System, is confident that Zelensky’s veiled warnings are a mere “bluff,” rather than any kind of statement of political or military significance. Europe is already trying to rid itself of US nuclear weapons stockpiles on its territory, and does not need another source of tensions stemming from a Ukrainian nuclear weapons programme, the retired officer argues. “The Ukrainian economy will never pull off doing what it takes to gain the status of a nuclear power. It is a very expensive proposition, from production to delivery vehicles and an entire infrastructure of the military-industrial complex and the nuclear energy complex. The uranium and other materials would need to be mined somewhere. All of this is not so simple; Zelensky does not appear to realize the complexity of this process,” Bizhev believes. UN Weighs In In his remarks before the Munich Security Forum on Saturday, President Zelensky announced that he would be “initiating consultations in the framework of the Budapest Memorandum.” “If they do not happen again or their results do not guarantee security for our country, Ukraine will have every right to believe that the Budapest Memorandum is not working and all the package decisions of 1994 are in doubt,” Zelensky warned. The United Nations commented on the Ukrainian president's remarks Saturday evening. Stephane Dujarric, a spokesman for Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, called on all parties to recall the UN chief's recent statement about public rhetoric surrounding the situation in Ukraine, and how it should be aimed at de-escalating tensions, not fueling discord.",russian,1,1449,89.42,26.23,22.41,6.89,27.87,31.47,80.19,61.35,49.14,7.04,1.73,0.21,0.21,0,0.28,0.97,5.31,15.18,9.73,0.76,15.18,7.59,3.04,5.59,1.73,12.7,7.25,2.55,10.28,1.1,2.28,7.18,12.91,0.83,12.08,2.14,2.07,1.66,1.86,0.97,4.07,0.07,3.45,0.97,2.48,0.35,0.07,0.28,0.07,0.21,0,0,7.38,3.66,0.14,0,0.55,0.14,2.14,3.24,0,0,0,0.41,6.49,2.97,0.9,2.62,2.83,0.35,0,2.28,0.21,0,0.28,0.07,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.21,0.07,0.48,0.62,0.14,0,0.14,1.45,0.28,2.55,7.73,0.48,1.17,5.45,0.55,0.14,0.21,2.83,1.93,4.83,1.04,0,0,0,0,0,16.77,3.52,6.35,0.28,0,1.38,5.24

Washington used these reports to call on all Americans to evacuate the Eastern European country ASAP. Ukraine's president has asked the media to provide more information. A Russian invasion of Ukraine may begin any day now but the White House cannot predict the specific day, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has said. ""A major military action could begin by Russia in Ukraine any day now,"" Sullivan said, speaking to CNN on Sunday. ""The way they have built up their forces, the way they have maneuvered things in place, makes it a distinct possibility there will be major military action very soon,"" he added. Sullivan stressed that the US would not allow Russia to start a ""surprise"" attack against Ukraine, promising to continue to share intelligence and warning the world to be prepared for Moscow to stage a pretext to justify an invasion. ""We are prepared to continue to work on diplomacy, but we are also prepared to respond in a united and decisive way with our allies and partners should Russia proceed,"" the top Biden national security official said. In a separate interview with Fox News on Sunday, Pentagon Spokesman John Kirby said he couldn't confirm Friday's report by Politico that Russia would start an invasion of Ukraine on 16 February. ""I'm not in a position to confirm those reports,"" Kirby said. ""We want to be careful about publicly talking about intelligence and sources and methods and that kind of thing. What I can tell you [is]...we believe a major military action could occur any day now,"" he added, apparently reading from the same talking points as Sullivan before his television appearance. ""And again, these assessments are coming from a variety of sources, and not exclusively just inside intelligence, but also what we're seeing in plain sight; these more than 100,000 troops now continue to be arrayed against Ukraine's border,"" Kirby said. ""I think a mosaic of the intelligence that we're seeing -not speaking to it specifically but uh, but you know we have good sources of intelligence and they're telling us that things are sort of building now to some sort of crescendo opportunity for Mr. Putin,"" the Pentagon spokesman added.

John Kirby says ""a mosaic of the intelligence"" suggests Russian attack on Ukraine could be imminent. pic.twitter.com/Bse3Skq7y4— The Recount (@therecount) February 13, 2022 Provocation Fears The officials' comments follow a warning by President Biden on Saturday in a telephone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin that Moscow would be made to pay ""swift and severe costs"" if it went ahead with its supposed Ukraine invasion plans. Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov dismissed the US ""invasion"" claims and charged Washington with ""artificially inflating hysteria."" Also on Saturday, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused the US government of colluding with the media to spark a fit of hysteria regarding the situation in Ukraine, warning that the US may be looking for a provocation to spark a conflict in the region. Moscow expressed concerns on Sunday about the decision of several countries to redeploy representatives to the Organisation for Security Co-operation in Europe's special monitoring mission in Ukraine (SMM). Earlier in the day, a spokesman for the self-proclaimed Lugansk People's Republic warned that the withdrawal of EU, US, and UK representatives from the SMM under the pretext that their safety could not be assured could mean that a large-scale provocation by Kiev or its Western benefactors may be in the offing. US and NATO officials and media began talking about Russia's alleged plans to ""imminently"" invade Ukraine last fall, regularly citing the ""100,000"" Russian troops near the border and quoting reports by unidentified officials to various outlets and calling on diplomats and nationals to evacuate the country. Russia has dismissed that it has any plans to invade its neighbour, calling on Kiev to implement the Minsk Agreements on Ukrainian peace, and suggesting that the West's allegations about Moscow's aggression may be aimed at justifying the further buildup of NATO troops near Russian frontiers. Officials in Kiev have also questioned their Western backers' invasion claims, saying Russia would need far more troops than it currently has near Ukraine to mount a successful invasion, and that Ukrainian intelligence is unaware of such invasion plans. Ukraine Conflict Marks 8th Anniversary Tensions in relations between Russia and the West over Ukraine began in February 2014, when pro-Western political forces backed by ultranationalist fighters overthrew the neutrality-seeking government in Kiev and attempted to push Ukraine toward integration with the European Union and NATO. The coup d'etat prompted authorities in Crimea to hold a referendum on the peninsula's status in March of 2014, with residents voting overwhelmingly to split off from Ukraine's jurisdiction and rejoin Russia. Efforts by independence-seeking forces across eastern and southern Ukraine opposed to the post-coup authorities to similarly split with Kiev led to a military and security crackdown, with activists in cities including Kharkiv and Odessa disappeared or murdered, and troops sent to the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk to crush fledgling pro-independence militia. The latter move sparked a civil war which led to the deaths of at least 13,000 people, and left over 2.5 million people displaced. In February 2015, the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France met in the Belarusian capital of Minsk to sign the Minsk  Agreements – stipulating a ceasefire, the pullback of forces from the conflict zone, elections in the breakaway regions and amendments to Ukraine's laws to grant the eastern breakaways broad autonomy in exchange for their return to Kiev's jurisdiction. The ceasefire was successfully implemented (despite regular reports of sniper and artillery fire, troop movements and other violations), but the Ukrainian government has refused to implement the political portion of the deal. Shortly after his election in 2019, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signaled his intent to do implement Minsk, prompting tens of thousands of ultranationalists to flood the streets of Kiev threatening to overthrow the government and forcing him to relent.",russian,1,1021,94.88,53.51,41.56,11.29,32.94,33.3,80.71,55.83,45.35,6.27,3.13,0.29,1.18,0.2,0.78,0.69,3.13,12.73,8.23,1.67,17.14,5.09,2.84,5.48,0.69,10.68,4.51,2.45,9.01,2.35,0.98,5.68,10.77,0.1,10.58,1.47,1.96,1.47,2.25,0.1,3.23,0,4.11,1.57,2.45,0.59,0.1,0.39,0.29,0.1,0,0,10.97,6.07,0.2,0.2,1.47,0.1,3.33,5.09,0,0,0.1,1.18,5.78,4.31,1.27,0.2,1.86,0.1,0.29,1.27,0.2,0,0.29,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.2,0.1,0.1,0,0,0,0,0.29,1.27,0.2,2.84,10.38,0.78,0.88,8.33,0.78,0,0.1,5,2.74,2.84,2.15,0.29,0.2,0,0.1,0,15.38,3.72,4.8,0,0,1.96,4.9

For example, the deployment of military bases in Latin America may be part of the answer,” United Russia MP Yuri Shvytkin, who is Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Defense Committee, told Russian online news outlet Gazeta.Ru on Friday. “The United States is afraid of this, because it will be close enough there for our missiles to fly up. I think that the Americans do not really want the missiles to reach New York or Washington quickly,” Shvytkin added. The MP was echoing comments by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov last month, who suggested in an interview with RTVI television network that Moscow might deploy Russian military infrastructure to Cuba or Venezuela. “I don’t want to confirm anything, I won’t exclude anything … It depends on the actions of [our] American colleagues,” Ryabkov told RTVI’s Tina Kandelaki on January 13. “The President of Russia has repeatedly spoken out on this topic, including what measures could be taken by the Russian Navy if things go completely in the direction of provoking Russia and further strengthening military pressure on us,” he said, adding, “We do not want this, the diplomats must come to an agreement.” Several days earlier, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said it was “unacceptable” for Moscow to expect NATO to respect its sphere of influence by pledging not to expand further eastward or to station certain weapons in Eastern Europe. “We can’t go back to a world of spheres of influence,” the US’ chief diplomat told CNN. However, following Ryabkov’s comments, US President Joe Biden firmly asserted a US sphere of influence across Latin America, upgrading the region from the popular term “America’s backyard” to declare that “everything south of the Mexican border is America’s front yard.” Soviet deployments to Cuba were common during the Cold War, most notoriously the R-12 and R-14 nuclear-armed ballistic missiles and Il-28 bombers that triggered the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. However, after the missiles were withdrawn Soviet ship and aircraft stopovers in Cuba were common, including Tu-95 and Tu-142 reconnaissance aircraft on patrol.

Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke with Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel in late January about the situation, and the Kremlin said the two leaders have “synchronized positions,” although not on the deployment of Russian military forces to the island. NATO has accused Russia of planning an invasion of Ukraine by deploying large numbers of troops near its western borders, although Moscow denies any plans for attacking Ukraine and says its troops are performing military maneuvers and drills with Belarusian forces. Moscow has said the crisis stems from a lack of guarantees of its security by NATO, which has continued to expand eastward and incorporate many former Soviet allies and even former Soviet republics. They have also expressed fears of NATO weapons deployed in Eastern Europe, including two Aegis Ashore installations in Poland and Romania that the US claims are for missile defense, but which are technically capable of firing offensive cruise missiles capable of reaching beyond Moscow.

Russian President Vladimir Putin hopes that Belarus will not shut off the transit of Russian gas to the EU.

""I would say on the Russian foreign minister's comments from this morning, I would say we welcome his comments that Russia does not want war and we would welcome a reply from the Russian government to the principles we have laid out for them, but this needs to be backed up with action. While we welcome the message, we need to see it backed up by swift action,"" the anonymous official said Friday. The upcoming United Nations Security Council meeting on Ukraine on Monday will be ""an opportunity for Russia to explain what it is doing,"" the official added. It will be a ""clear opportunity"" for Moscow to reveal whether they ""see a path for diplomacy or are interested in pursuing conflict,"" the official said. ""We'll also be prepared to call out disinformation and diversionary tactics Russia may use including their claims that Ukraine is provoking conflict and [that] NATO is to blame for these tensions,"" the official said. Earlier Friday, Russian deputy permanent representative to the UN Dmitri Polyansky blasted Washington's call for a Security Council meeting on Ukraine as a ""shameful"" ""PR stunt."" ""I can't recall another occasion when a Security Council member proposed to discuss its own baseless allegations and assumptions as a threat to [the] international order from someone else. Hopefully fellow UNSC members will not support this clear PR stunt shameful for the reputation of the UN Security Council,"" Polyansky tweeted. I can’t recall another occasion when a SC member proposed to discuss its own baseless allegations and assumptions as a threat to intl order from someone else. Hopefully fellow UNSC members will not support this clear PR stunt shameful for the reputation of UN Security Council https://t.co/2HCjnQh0ic— Dmitry Polyanskiy (@Dpol_un) January 28, 2022 On Thursday, US ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield announced that Washington was calling for ""an open meeting of the Security Council to discuss a matter of crucial importance to international peace and security"" related to ""Russia's threatening behaviour against Ukraine and the buildup of Russian troops on Ukraine's borders and in Belarus."" In addition to the ""troop buildup,"" Thomas-Greenfield accused Moscow of ""engaging in other destabilizing acts aimed at Ukraine, posing a clear threat to international peace and security and the UN Charter."" The ambassador from Norway, which presently holds the rotating presidency at the Security Council, confirmed Friday that the meeting on Ukraine would take place. Ukraine War Fears and Russia's Security Proposals Foreign Minister Lavrov sat down with the heads of four major Russian radio stations earlier Friday to discuss pressing international issues - chief among them the continued escalation of tensions between Moscow and the West over Ukraine. He stressed that tensions would not come to war if it was in Russia's power to decide, but warned that Moscow wouldn't allow the US and its allies to ""grossly ignore our interests, either."" Lavrov argued that Russia's security proposals - which were delivered to the US and NATO in mid-December and on which Moscow received formal written responses on Wednesday, were not unreasonable - but a desire by the Russian side to ""be treated honestly"" and fairly and to have its security concerns taken into account. Under the security proposals, Russia and NATO would be required to refrain from deploying troops, missile systems, aircraft and warships in areas where they could be seen as a threat to the other side, and the Western bloc would have to halt its eastward expansion plans and efforts to incorporate Ukraine, Georgia and other former Soviet republics. Moscow's proposals come after decades of continuous NATO expansion toward Russia's borders, despite a commitment by US officials in 1990 that the alliance would not move ""one inch east"" of a reunified Germany. Every former member of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact alliance, three former Soviet republics and four republics of the former Yugoslavia have been incorporated into NATO since its eastward expansion began in 1999. The contents of the US and NATO responses have not been revealed, but US officials and alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg have said publicly that the bloc's 'open door' policy would not be subject to negotiations. Washington and its allies have spent months claiming that Russia has amassed ""100,000 troops"" on Ukraine's borders in preparations for invasion. Moscow has denied these claims, and accused the West of using the ""invasion threat"" as a pretext to shore up its military presence in Eastern Europe. In a unusual development unseen since the pro-Western coup in Kiev in 2014, even Ukraine's government has recently begun criticizing Western officials and media for their Russia fearmongering, with high ranking politicians and security officials stressing they see no evidence of an ""imminent"" Russian threat and estimating that Moscow would need two, three or even four times more troops to attack.",russian,1,1194,82.1,50.03,31.15,6.49,29.85,30.9,83.25,57.87,46.4,8.63,3.69,0.34,1.59,0,1.01,0.67,4.94,13.15,6.78,1.26,14.41,6.62,2.18,6.28,1.93,12.4,5.86,2.01,9.72,4.27,0.84,4.69,11.06,0.25,10.8,1.68,1.26,2.43,1.51,0.42,4.27,0.17,5.19,1.76,3.35,1.01,0.17,0.75,0.25,0.17,0,0,15.16,8.54,1.51,0.59,1.59,0.67,3.02,6.62,0,0,0,1.09,5.78,4.69,1.01,0.08,2.09,0,0,2.01,0.17,0,0.17,0.08,0.08,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.92,0.5,0.5,0.17,0,0,0.17,2.18,0.34,2.93,9.63,0.67,0.75,7.45,0.67,0,0.25,4.36,4.19,3.27,2.26,0.17,0.17,0,0,0,17.34,3.52,4.86,0,0,2.18,6.78

Russian President Vladimir Putin has recalled that even prior to the threats of his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko, there were precedents where transit countries blocked Russian gas supplies to Europe. He namely brought up a gas crisis that unfolded in 2008 and 2009 between Russia and Ukraine, resulting, at one point, in a cessation of supplies to the EU. Putin recalled that the two countries were stuck in ""endless disputes"" over the gas price and could not come to an agreement for a long time. It all led to Kiev eventually stopping Russian gas supplies to Europe through its territory. ""It got to the point that Ukraine blocked our gas, which is intended for consumers in Europe. As experts say, [they] basically turned the valve, simply cut off Russian gas to Europe"".Vladimir PutinRussian President Recently, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko threatened to do the same with another pipeline – Yamal-Europe – if the EU proceeds with slapping his country with more economic sanctions. Brussels threatened Minsk with new economic measures after Warsaw and several other states baselessly accused Belarus of facilitating the migrant crisis on its border with Poland. Putin, however, expressed hope that Lukashenko would not proceed to go through with his threat. The Russian president said that his Belarusian counterpart never discussed the move with him and promised to talk to Lukashenko about it. At the same time, Putin suggested that the Belarusian president could have issued the threat in the heat of the moment. Ukrainian Government Stops Gas Transit Amid Row With Russia The crisis that Putin recalled started back in 2008, when the Ukrainian government refused to sign an agreement with Russia's Gazprom on a new gas price for 2009, which was substantially lower than the market one in Europe. At the same time, RosUkrEnergo, which was partially controlled by Ukrainian oligarchs and served as a middleman in Russia-Ukraine gas sales, racked up $2.4 billion in debt to Gazprom, purportedly due to corruption. Amid the failure to reach an agreement in the talks, Gazprom and Moscow threatened in December to cut gas supplies to Ukraine unless it would repay the entire debt and agree to buy the blue fuel at European prices. After the threat was implemented in January 2009, Ukraine responded by siphoning a portion of the Russian gas heading to Europe through its territory. This led to a full stop of transit on 7 January. Kiev repeatedly denied it stole any gas. The two countries eventually agreed on new prices for transit and gas for Ukraine itself at $232 per thousand cubic metres. While the transit to Europe was supposed to resume on 13 January, due to the actions of the Ukrainian authorities and state gas company Naftogaz, this only happened on 19 January 2009, thus leaving European countries without a significant portion of Russian gas supplies for almost three weeks. The incident prompted Moscow to boost the construction of alternative pipelines that could serve as backups, including Nord Stream.",russian,1,537,98.07,33.72,37.65,6.03,26.85,32.4,76.54,54.93,45.07,6.33,1.49,0,0.19,0,1.12,0.19,4.84,15.08,8.75,3.54,19.18,2.98,3.35,3.91,0.56,7.26,3.91,4.66,4.66,0.19,0.56,4.1,8.57,0.37,8.19,0.74,1.49,1.49,1.12,0.37,3.35,0.56,3.91,1.12,2.79,0.19,0.19,0,0,0,0,0,7.08,4.1,0,0,1.86,0.37,1.3,2.61,0,0,0,1.12,5.96,2.42,3.54,0,3.91,0,0,1.86,2.23,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.74,0.19,0.37,0,0.37,0,0.19,2.05,0,2.61,8.75,0,1.49,7.64,0.19,0,0.19,5.77,4.28,0.56,1.12,0.19,0,0.19,0,0,10.99,4.1,4.66,0,0,0.19,2.05

""If we talk about Belarus, we perfectly understand that the purpose of the sanctions pressure exerted on Minsk is to deliberately bring down the standard of living of ordinary citizens, provoke a new wave of anti-government protests. How else can one explain the imposition of restrictions on entire sectors of the Belarusian industry, its largest enterprises, on which the welfare of hundreds of thousands of Belarusians depends?"" Pankin said. Numerous sanctions introduced by the West against Belarus that affect Russia are more like a punishment for Minsk for its friendship with Moscow, Alexander Pankin said. ""In October, the European Parliament adopted a resolution condemning Russian-Belarusian integration. How does this fit in with the concern about the state of democracy in Belarus itself, declared by the initiators of the sanctions? It is more like a punishment for friendship with Russia,"" Pankin said. The diplomat recalled that last December, the US Congress adopted the Belarus Democracy, Human Rights, and Sovereignty Act, which provides for the possibility of imposing sanctions against Russian citizens and representatives of the Union State, while the EU blacklisted two Russians. Moscow and Minsk are coordinating their efforts to take measures in response to Western sanctions, Pankin added. ""Russia supports Belarus in resisting the West's pressure. We are pursuing a coordinated policy of taking response measures, joint 'stop lists,' helping to mitigate the negative social and economic consequences of restrictions for Belarusian citizens. We will continue this close cooperation with Minsk,"" Pankin said. After the presidential election held in Belarus on 9 August 2020, in which Alexander Lukashenko won for the sixth time with 80.1% of the vote, massive opposition protests took place in the country. Relations between Belarus and Western countries after the election deteriorated sharply, with a number of them gradually introducing sanctions against Belarusian officials, as well as enterprises, accusing Minsk of election and human rights violations. Lukashenko has since repeatedly accused the West of directly interfering in Belarusian affairs, claiming that the unrest is directed by the United States, with Europeans merely going along with it.

321,tass.com,2021-11-03 07:00:00,https://tass.com/pressreview/1357327,Press review : Russia future in the climate change battle and US seeks to challenge OPEC+ - Press Review,English,,"The preservation of forests and other natural ecosystems is playing a decisive role in the fight against global warming, Russian President Vladimir Putin said in his video message to the participants of the Glasgow Climate Conference (COP26). He stressed that Russia intends to stop greenhouse emissions by 2060, and the country’s vast forests should help assist this effort. Meanwhile, the political part of COP26 came to an end. However, as many of the participants feared, it did not produce any breakthroughs. According to experts interviewed by Izvestia, this is due to the fact that countries are not ready to answer for their decisions before the world community. ""Russia is not up against the dilemma of whether or not to use carbon-based energy resources as sharply as, for example, European countries or small island states, which could choose sources,"" Deputy Head of the Commission on Sustainable Development and Ecology of the Russian Association for UN Assistance Natalia Ryazanova told Izvestia. ""Russia didn't really need to become a part of the overall process, but when it started to acquire more and more economic features, it became clear that Russia had to join it,"" she added. The expert added that Russia is moving towards cleaner fuel at its own pace. According to Putin, in the coming years, an energy transition using hydrogen awaits Russia. The issue is that Western countries shape rules for other states, and in this sense, the norms for the EU countries will also apply to those players who want to trade with the EU, Ryazanova emphasized. Putin's address was timed to coincide with the release of the Declaration on Forests and Land Use, which was signed by 105 countries, including Russia. The Declaration, however, is not the only agreement reached at COP26. For example, on November 2, the White House announced that almost 100 nations have already joined the global initiative to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030. However, the situation here is somewhat more complicated than with forests. ""Russia has one of the largest gas pipeline networks, and one way or another, methane leaks happen there. The same thing occurs in the United States, but this does not prevent the US from standing up for the struggle,"" Director of the National Energy Institute Sergey Pravosudov told Izvestia.  A ministerial meeting of OPEC and its allies, including Russia, to determine the levels of oil output in December is scheduled for next Thursday. Most oil-producing countries support maintaining the already approved plans to increase oil output. However, there are many countries dissatisfied with the high oil prices in consumer countries. And for US President Joe Biden, expensive gasoline has already become a real political headache. Washington is assembling a coalition against the position of Saudi Arabia and Russia. Experts told Nezavisimaya Gazeta that the escalation of the conflict over oil prices could lead to new sanctions. Over the past year, Brent oil has soared by 130% from $36 to $83 and foreign analysts expect further hikes. The current oil market situation clearly does not suit the US. According to media reports, Washington could even assemble a coalition to pressure OPEC+ and force the cartel to boost oil production. According to experts interviewed by Nezavisimaya Gazeta, a conflict between the US and OPEC+ would be possible only after the meeting on November 4, if the cartel decides not to increase oil output. Any sort of confrontation between OPEC+ and the United States will not transpire any time soon, head of the BCS World of Investments department Vasily Karpunin told the newspaper. ""So far, no leverage against OPEC+ has been seen. The OPEC + deal is over two years old, and so far, nothing like this has happened,"" he pointed out. He also noted if the situation with oil prices were really critical for US politicians, they could have reached a compromise with Iran long ago and lifted the oil embargo against it. Karpunin believes that ""supplies from this country would help balance the oil market and put pressure on prices"". Head of the analytical department of AMarkets Artem Deev also doubts that putting pressure on importing countries will be effective. ""The conflict between the United States and OPEC+ over price reductions can only head in one direction, an unsuccessful one for the United States,"" said Deputy Head of Alpari Natalya Milchakova.  The fifth package of sanctions against Belarus may be adopted as early as mid-November. The coming new restrictions are over the migration crisis on the border of Belarus and the EU, and Europe sees Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko as the culprit. At the same time, the Belarusian issue will be discussed in Vienna with the participation of representatives from the Lukashenko administration. However, experts interviewed by Nezavisimaya Gazeta are not sure that the Belarusian leadership will be satisfied with the proposed format. For the first time since last year’s presidential elections, Europe contemplated whether sanctions alone are enough to solve the question of Belarus. However, Austria’s talks initiative did not really surprise the Belarusian expert community. Vienna is seen as Lukashenko’s main lobbyist in Europe, given that it has its own business interests in Belarus, Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes. At the same time, experts are still very cautious about Austria's initiative being actually implemented. Political scientist Valery Karbalevich highlighted the fact that Brussels and Minsk have different mutual interests. Karbalevich also doubts that Minsk will agree to take part in the Vienna conference at all. Political scientist Igor Tyshkevich suggests that ""breakthroughs"" should not be expected from Vienna’s initiative. In his opinion, Austria is trying ""to test the parties’ readiness for dialogue, and at the same time to strengthen its influence within the EU"". The expert believes that Russia could respond to the invitation if it needs it to put pressure on Minsk, but in this case, Belarus will not send its representatives to the event. He does not rule out that both sides could join the event at the level of pro-government experts, which means, people far from making decisions.  Moscow and Washington are gearing up for a second summit between Presidents Vladimir Putin of Russia and Joe Biden of the United States. The date and format of the expected event have not yet been announced, as well as the topics to be discussed by both leaders. US political scientist and University of Chicago Professor John Mearsheimer, who is also a member of the Valdai Discussion Club, told Kommersant that Washington should be interested in normalizing relations with Russia, as it bears the main responsibility for the current conditions of bilateral relations. According to the expert, the chances of US-Russian relations improving in the foreseeable future are very slim. Even if Biden wanted to dramatically change the situation for the better, it would be very difficult, since Russophobic sentiments are so widespread that it would take enormous efforts on the part of the administration to change its policy towards Moscow. Meanwhile, Biden has a number of much more serious problems than the state of US-Russian relations, Mearsheimer noted. The current state of affairs was influenced by several factors, among them, NATO’s eastward expansion coupled with the so-called color revolutions, and the United States believing that all countries should behave the way Washington wants, the expert noted. According to him, the US bears major responsibility for the deplorable state of bilateral relations with Russia. And it is the US that should be interested in normalizing relations, as an alliance between Russia and China is not in Washington’s interests. Touching on the upcoming summit, Mearsheimer would advise Biden to take specific steps to improve relations with Russia. In particular, stop talking about further NATO expansion and make it clear to Putin that he understands Russia’s strategic interests in Eastern Europe.  Gazprom has not booked additional transit capacities of Russian gas via the Yamal-Europe gas pipeline through Poland to Europe for the first, second, and third quarters of 2022. According to Kommersant, the refusal to book can be explained by Gazprom's expectation that certification of the Nord Stream 2 operator will soon be completed, as well as by weak competition from LNG in Europe. Gazprom also refused to book additional transit capacities through Ukraine. The Russian energy giant chose not to book extra capacities in order to get more certainty on the level of gas demand in Europe, on reserves in UGS facilities, as well as on the timing of the launch of Nord Stream 2 by the end of 2021, Maria Belova from Vygon Consulting told Kommersant. Gazprom's reluctance to book capacities for a long time can be explained by the expectation of the launch of Nord Stream 2, as its certification has not yet been completed. In addition, the company’s decision may indicate that it is not going to increase supplies to the European market above contractual obligations in 2022, and so it does not expect high competition from LNG suppliers or a growing struggle for market share in the region. Dmitry Marinchenko from Fitch believes that Gazprom is likely planning to redirect at least some of the gas flows through Ukraine and Poland to Nord Stream 2. Therefore, the company chose not to book capacities in order not to take on additional obligations.

Asked on the show ""Soloviev Live"" how Belarus would respond to an offensive by Ukraine Lukashenko said, ""in the same way as Russia"". Asked whether the answer would be coordinated with Moscow, he replied, ""naturally"". Lukashenko said that Belarus would not export fuel or electricity to Ukraine if Kiev's behaviour led to a war with Russia. ""We will cut off all fuel and lubricant supplies to Ukraine...as well as electricity. We will not supply it if they start a war against us or Russia"", he explained. Lukashenko said the two allies ""drew red lines"" and Ukraine would face consequences if it crossed them. Answering a question from the host he confirmed it includes possible rocket strikes against Ukraine. According to the president, the crisis in the region is escalating because the United States is pushing Kiev towards war. ""This is just the essence of the war, about which you and we are having debates now: 'Ukraine will fight'. Well, it is not Ukraine, it is Americans who are pushing it [Ukraine] to war"", Lukashenko told the Russian YouTube show ""Soloviev Live"". In addition to that, the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) proved its effectiveness during the unrest in Kazakhstan, and the West knows it, according to Lukashenko. The West understands it is futile to fight against with Russia, according to Lukashenko. ""Do they not see it? Therefore, they understand that it is futile to fight with us, especially with Russia. We are not talking about some kind of nuclear and other weapons. But it is better not to touch us"", Lukashenko said. Over the past several weeks, Washington, London, and their allies have been pushing the idea that Moscow is planning to ""invade"" Ukraine, citing a buildup of Russian troops at the border. Russia has repeatedly rejected all the accusations as fake, and, in turn, expressed concerns over NATO's military activities in the region. So far, the US, UK, Canada, and the Baltic States have supplied several batches of lethal arms to Ukraine, with Washington also dispatching additional forces to Poland and Romania. According to Moscow, the ""invasion"" craze in the media is being stirred up as Kiev is planning a provocation against Russia in Donbass, which has been engulfed in war since 2014.",russian,1,400,80.43,42.99,43.72,1.76,19.05,27.75,78.25,61.5,51.25,9.5,4.5,0,1.75,0.25,1,1.25,5,12.25,8.25,0.5,15,8,3,6.5,1.5,14.75,3.25,2,7.75,2.75,1,4,13.75,0.5,12.75,3.25,2,1.25,2,0.25,6,0,5,1,4,0.25,0,0.25,0,0.25,0,0,13,7.25,1,0,1.75,0.75,4,6,0,0,0,1.25,3.75,2,1,0.75,0.75,0,0,0.75,0,0,1.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.25,0.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.75,0,2.5,9.25,0,1.5,6.5,1,0,0.25,2.25,4.5,5,1.25,0,0,0,0,0,21.5,5.75,7.5,0.25,0,1,7

The travel advisory, issued on January 31, came in conjunction with the DOS ordering the departure of family members of US government employees from Belarus. The state department cited Russian military activity along the border with Ukraine and the unpredictability of the situation as their chief concerns.

The second phase of their joint exercise is set to take place between February 10 and 20.

The talks will be the culmination of the diplomatic year for Moscow and Beijing, continuing the rapprochement in response to the West’s containment policy. Each side views the other as a pillar of support in counteracting external threats. For Moscow these threats constitute US-NATO activity in the post-Soviet space and in Europe, while for Beijing, it is the anti-Chinese alliances in the Indo-Pacific Region. Without entering a military alliance, Russia and China prefer to act, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, ""back to back."" ""From the previous format of non-binding ‘strategic partnership’ Russia and China, under Western pressure, are moving to a new stage of cooperation - a de facto military alliance which, however, was not executed in the international legal format,"" Head of the Political and Military Research Center at the Institute for the US and Canadian Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences Vladimir Batyuk told the newspaper. According to him, the evolution of military cooperation between Moscow and Beijing was determined by two key factors - the efforts on bringing NATO infrastructure to Russia’s western border and the formation of an anti-Chinese ""sanitary cordon"" along China’s southern and eastern borders. ""In 2021, the parties significantly increased political, military and economic cooperation. At the same time, tension was growing both in Eastern Europe and in Eastern Asia. And each side separately was conducting its complicated dialogue with the US. In recent months, this dialogue appeared more successful for Russia than for China,"" said Vasily Kashin, who heads the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at the Higher School of Economics. ""Meanwhile, Moscow and Beijing constantly suspect the US of efforts at undermining Russian-Chinese relations and strive to inform each other of their dialogue with the Americans. Despite the long journey traveled in bolstering the trust, certain doubts about each other’s positions in the context of a new confrontation of great powers will remain for a long time,"" the expert explained. Deputy Director at the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Institute of World Economy and International Relations Alexander Lomanov said that the bilateral trade figures that grew by 34% in the past 11 months, amounting to $130.4 bln, are an encouraging background for the conversation between the Russian and Chinese leaders, emphasizing, however, ""that it is impossible to notice that the volumes of bilateral investment flows remain insufficient which indicates insufficient mutual trust between economic elites."" ""Russian-Chinese relations are built on the finest nuances and reflect the situation around each country,"" Director of the Institute of Asian and African Studies Alexey Maslov says. According to him, Russian conflicts with the West are much less explosive and for the most part are controlled by Russia itself. Thus, according to the expert, not only is China Russia’s most important trade partner but, above all, Russia is the only absolutely reliable partner for China.  Next Monday, Kiev will host talks with the leaders of Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania. The leaders of the Lublin Triangle countries will meet for the first time to discuss the situation around the threat of a possible ""Russian invasion."" Kiev will be testing its air raid siren system during the visit of Polish President Andrzej Duda and Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda. On Monday night, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba held the first phone conversation with Germany’s new Minister for Foreign Affairs Annalena Baerbock. According to the Ukrainian side, they discussed the situation along the Ukrainian border with Russia and Belarus as well as the necessity to renew work in the Normandy format. After the Putin-Biden virtual summit, some experts in Kiev thought that the US president would pressure the Zelensky administration into implementing the Minsk Accords in the order of their provisions. This would mean bestowing a special status to the part of Donbass that Ukraine currently does not control. However, Kiev claims that there wasn’t even a hint on the part of Washington of such demands. Ukrainian political expert Victor Vovk noted that the current format of talks on Donbass has led to a dead end and proposed returning to the previous formats of the participants. ""The first international format of talks regarding Russia’s aggression was the Budapest one (with the participation of the US and the UK), then there was the Budapest plus format or the Geneva one (with the participation of the US and the UK as a single structure, not with separate EU member states). Precisely these formats were demolished by then newly-elected President Poroshenko to please Putin and Obama in Normandy on June 6, 2014… It was precisely then when Poroshenko de facto agreed to substantially decrease the responsibility of the guarantor states, the US and the UK, as well as the EU, for Ukraine’s fate."" Germany and France as mediators in the Normandy format could not effectively facilitate the settlement which resulted in the conflict dragging on for over seven years. The expert thinks that Zelensky should have returned to the previous formats in 2019 or attempt to do so now.  The Russian army will soon conduct a series of drills on its Western border using Iskander operational and tactical missile systems, in addition to holding other ""military and military-technical events"" in response to the deployment of US medium-range missiles in Europe, according to Russia’s Defense Ministry and a statement by Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov. According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, Moscow is concerned about the creation of a ""so-called artillery command that last century was managing medium-range Pershing missile systems"" in Europe. And, in the near future, Europe and NATO should expect Russia’s new asymmetrical actions. According to expert evaluations, now new effective modern missiles will appear in Europe instead of the Pershings. According to the US Drive magazine, the new Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) missiles will be deployed in Germany with a range capability of 310 miles (500 kilometers). It was noted that the range can be expanded to 800 kilometers meaning that the systems can easily strike Moscow or St. Petersburg from the Baltic states or Poland. Additionally, plans are in store to deploy prospective hypersonic Dark Eagle missile systems and Typhon fleet complexes with the range up to 2,000 kilometers which means that the missiles can reach important strategic objects in central Russia. NATO claims that these systems won’t have nuclear warheads. Ryabkov, however, notes that ""there is no trust in principle of NATO as an alliance."" Russia cannot control the missiles the US will deploy in Europe and has no guarantees they won’t carry nuclear weapons. In response, Russia may deploy medium-range missiles with nuclear warheads on its western borders and possibly in Belarus. Military expert, retired colonel Nikolay Elbekchiev told the newspaper that Russia had plans to develop new armaments in response to the US deciding to exit the INF Treaty. ""I don’t doubt that such weapons already exist in the Russian Armed Forces."" The expert thinks that the next step is the deployment of these complexes in Belarus. ""Then any NATO strategic object in Europe will be targeted by the Iskanders,"" the expert concluded.  Gas prices in Europe continued to surge as January futures hit a record of $1,600 per 1,000 cubic meters, surpassing October’s highs. They climbed following a statement by Germany’s new Minister for Foreign Affairs Annalena Baerbock that Nord Stream 2 cannot yet be launched since the German regulator suspended its certification due to non-compliance with European energy legislation. Gazprom could increase its gas deliveries to Europe, yet the energy giant is not in a rush to do so. The supplies along the main transport routes remain stable while underground storage facilities are still not filled to their capacity. A decrease in wind generation in Europe may have also influenced the price hike. Sergey Kapitonov, gas industry analyst at the Moscow School of Management SKOLKOVO Energy Center, notes that an apparent ""bullish"" trend is noted on Europe’s gas market. Gas prices are being pushed up both by the strategy of the suppliers of LNG and Gazprom, and record high prices for CO2 along with the political background around Nord Stream 2. Additionally, the expert thinks that there is a strong correlation with energy markets. For example, because of weather conditions it is not always possible to fully use the capacities of wind energy. Ivan Timonin of Vygon Consulting notes that the current price surge was mostly triggered by the change in expectations regarding the launch of Nord Stream 2. Dmitry Marinchenko of Fitch forecasts that given this background, Moscow won’t significantly increase deliveries to Europe and the prospect of a gas deficit in Europe, especially if the winter is cold, seems likely. ""High volatility on the market and high prices are likely to remain at least until the end of the heating season,"" he noted.  At the beginning of the week, the Russian stock market plunged to record lows in more than a year and half. At the end of trading on December 13, the MOEX index dropped by 3.77% to 3,613 points, while the RTS index sank almost by 3.98% to 1,548 points. A similar record low was recorded last April amid the coronavirus pandemic and worldwide lockdowns, turbulence on exchange markets and record oil price drops to $37.6 per barrel. The market continued to drop on December 14 as well, rolling back to the levels of February 2021. Head of the Finam stock analysis department Igor Dodonov thinks that the West’s harsh anti-Russian rhetoric and increased sanctions risks are playing against Russian market now. All of this causes increases anxiety among both Russian and foreign investors. According to Mikhail Zeltser, a stock market expert at BCS Global, the drop is caused both by geopolitical factors and the spread of the Omicron strain as well as by expectations that the US Federal Reserve is downsizing their quantitative easing program along with the monetary clampdown of global central banks. Mikhail Vasilyev, chief analyst at Sovcombank, explained that harsh rhetoric with regards to ""red lines"" between Russia and the West remains, while pressure on Nord Stream 2 is being ramped up. He pointed out that the market can recover due to the Christmas increase on Western sites, a decrease in geopolitical tensions, an increase in oil prices in case of decreased Omicron risks or a cold winter. Vladimir Bragin of Alfa Capital concurs, saying that the market can grow if the general news background is calm. Otherwise, one can expect a decrease yet not as dramatic as the recent drop.

The 28th OSCE Ministerial Council in Stockholm has become one of the few major political events in 2021, where top diplomats from 57 member states have had a chance to meet in person and share views on security and cooperation. The Swedish government has made the event open to the media from all over the world, with journalists being actually invited to Stockholm rather than participating online. When it comes to the overall political tone of the event, there was a strong pro-US and pro-NATO political slant in the rhetoric at the council meetings and on the sidelines, with non-Euro-Atlantic proposals being unwelcome. According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who took part in the plenary sessions and held several bilateral meetings in Stockholm, Russia’s initiative on preventing the use of the Internet by terrorists, which is backed by the Collective Security Treaty Organisaton (CSTO), was outright rejected by the OSCE. “Unfortunately, our Western partners have removed our initiative from the agenda without any explanation,” said Lavrov. “Actually, it was obvious that it didn’t suit them that it was Russia’s initiative."" Russia’s CSTO ally Belarus also experienced its share of pressure at the OSCE Ministerial Council. Even though the country’s foreign minister Vladimir Makey was present in Stockholm and had a series of meetings with top diplomats, it seems that the organisers and the Swedish media have shifted their attention to exiled Belarusian opposition figure Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who was appearing on TV shows, giving interviews on the sidelines of the OSCE event, and meeting American diplomats and Swedish government officials.

Swedish authorities, however, have made it clear that they prefer to support the opposition. According to the Swedish government's website, on Friday Tikhanovskaya was invited to a meeting with the country’s EU minister Hans Dahlgren. “Sweden and the EU have an important role in promoting a positive development in the country by putting pressure on the regime and supporting the forces that work for a democratic Belarus,” said Dahlgren before the meeting. Both Russia and Belarus are being constantly bombarded with threats of western sanctions, and on the sidelines of the OSCE council Russia’s top diplomat gave his view on yet another round of economic restrictions against Moscow over the situation in Ukraine. “Practically everywhere at the talks, which include countries that do not share western views, at first we see a threat of sanctions, and then they are being imposed if someone is not abiding,” Lavrov said. He also pointed at factors, which, in his opinion, get in the way of pragmatism within international organisations, such as the OSCE: “I certainly hope that we’re not dealing with a regrettable fact that the westerners have lost the ability for negotiation, and that it’s the Russophobic current within NATO and the EU that does not allow them to do real work, to set aside confrontation, to do things that OSCE was made for doing.” The OSCE was established in 1973 following international talks initiated by the USSR, and is currently the world’s largest security-oriented bloc. The organisation’s summits end with the acceptance of consensus declarations, which are not legally binding – a fact, which is criticised by some experts who say that OSCE meetings are therefore “a big effort for nothing.""

Russia has recognised the independence of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, President Vladimir Putin has announced. ""I deem it necessary to make a decision that should have been made long ago - to immediately recognise the sovereignty and independence of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Lugansk People's Republic"", Putin said. The Russian president signed the corresponding documents and asked the Federal Assembly to support the signing of treaties of cooperation with the Donbass breakaways. Putin called on Kiev to ""immediately stop hostilities"" against the newly recognised states, warning that ""otherwise, all responsibility for the possibile continuation of bloodshed will be entirely on the conscience of the regime ruling Ukraine"". Ukraine's Tumultuous Fate ""Ukraine is not just a neighbour to us, but an inherent part of our history, culture and spiritual space. These are our comrades...our family, people we have blood and family ties with"", Putin said in an address to the nation Monday night outlining his decision. ""Modern Ukraine was completely created by Russia, more precisely by Bolshevik, Communist Russia. This process was started immediately after the 1917 Revolution"", Putin said. The president suggested that Ukraine saw its territory expand at ""historic Russia's"" expense after the revolution, and at Poland's expense after the Second World War, with Poland receiving compensation in the form of German lands to its west. He also recalled that Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev cut Crimea off from the Russian Soviet republic's jurisdiction and handed it over to the Ukrainian Soviet republic in 1954. ""As a result of Bolshevik policy, Soviet Ukraine arose, which even today can with good reason be called 'Vladimir Ilyich Lenin's Ukraine'. He is its author and architect. This is fully confirmed in archival documents, including hard Leninist directives on the Donbass, which was literally squeezed into Ukraine"", Putin said. After the collapse of the USSR, Putin said, Ukraine was gradually taken over by nationalist forces and oligarchs who had ""nothing to do with"" its achievement of independence. At the same time, Putin recalled, Russia continued to work with post-Soviet Ukraine, to act in an ""open and honest manner with respect to Ukraine's interests"", including through growing trade cooperation, which reached over $50 billion per year by the early 2010s, and in subsidising the country's development to the tune of $250 billion between 1991 and 2013. NATO Danger Putin suggested Ukrainian radicals backed and funded by the US took direct advantage of popular anger over corruption in 2014 to stage a coup, with the country's current ""patriotic"" authorities beginning a ""decommunisation"" campaign and leading the country toward de-sovereignisation and total subservience to the West, while marginalising the Russian-speaking community, undermining the rights of Orthodox believers, and posing a danger to Russia's security. ""Today grateful descendents have demolished monuments to Lenin in Ukraine. This is what they call decommunisation. You want decommunisation? Well, that's just fine with us. But there's no need to stop halfway as they say. We are prepared to show you what real decommunisation means for Ukraine"", Putin said, referring to his step to recognise the DPR and LPR's sovereignty. Putin accused the current authorities in Ukraine of seeking to drag other countries into a war with Russia. ""We have also heard statements about Ukraine threatening to create a nuclear weapon"", he said. The Russian president suggested this was not an ""idle threat"", with Ukraine possessing Soviet-era nuclear and missile technology to make a push to create such a weapon. ""We cannot help but react to this real threat"", he warned. Putin added that Moscow could not even exclude the danger of Ukraine receiving assistance from the West in building a nuke, given the billions of dollars in military assistance already sent to Ukraine by NATO nations in recent years. Putin warned that Ukraine's entry into the Western alliance would constitute a ""direct threat"" to Russia's security, and that the alliance's training centres already established in the country amount to military bases - something illegal under Ukraine's own Constitution. Ukraine as part of NATO would inevitably serve as a springboard from which the bloc - which has openly designated Moscow as its main adversary - can attack Russia, according to the president. Putin recalled that despite posing no threat to the Western alliance after the Cold War, Russia has received five waves of NATO expansion - nothwithstanding promises in the early 1990s not to do so. ""They simply lied to us"", he said. The Russian president also pointed to the deployment of dual-use US missile defence systems in Eastern Europe which can be used to attack targets deep inside Russia, and said the military threat to Moscow will increase ""manyfold"" as the number of these systems inevitably grows. He added that the deployment of NATO radar equipment in Ukraine would allow them to effectively control airspace inside Russia. ""American strategic planning documents - documents contain the possibility of carrying out a so-called 'preemptive strike on enemy missile systems'. Who the main enemy is for the US and NATO we know. It's Russia"", Putin said. Security Guarantee Proposals Ignored Putin recalled that Russia laid out a pair of draft security treaties for consideration by the US and NATO in December in a bid to defuse the current crisis. Unfortunately, he said, the West has rejected them, including key requests from the Russian side that NATO halt its eastward expansion, avoid the deployment of strike systems, and stop the buildup of military infrastructure in the Eastern European countries that joined the alliance after the signing of the Russia-NATO Founding Act of 1997. Hinting at the possibility of new sanctions against Russia over its decision on the Donbass, Putin suggested the West has always had ""only one goal - to hold back the development of Russia. And they will do it, as they did before, even without any formal pretext. Simply because we exist"". However, Russia ""will never compromise our sovereignty, national interests, or our values"", Putin said. Security Council Discussion Earlier Monday, speaking at an emergency session of the Russian Security Council in the Kremlin, Putin said that the negotiating process on the Donbass has reached a dead-end. He specified that the discussion on the future of the self-proclaimed republics was about recognising them as independent states, not a matter of their becoming part of Russia. Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of Russia's lower house of parliament, asked Putin to consider the parliamentary appeal approved last week to recognise the DPR and LNR as independent states. The lawmaker pointed out that over 1.2 million residents of the Donbass have already applied for Russian citizenship. For her part, Valentina Matviyenko, chairwoman of the Federation Council - Russia's upper house of parliament, said the time had come to make a decision on the Donbass, and called the situation in the region a ""humanitarian disaster and genocide"" in the heart of Europe. She noted that throughout the close to eight-year-long conflict, Russia has consistently stood in favour of a diplomatic and political solution. ""No one listened to us. There was an imitation of the Minsk Agreements"", she said. At the same time, the chairwoman accused the West of trying to push Russians and Ukrainians, two fraternal Slavic peoples, into a war. Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin expressed support for the measure, saying it would be appropriate in the absence of any progress on the Minsk Agreements. He added that officials have spent some time preparing for the West's potential reaction to a Russian recognition of the Donbass, with these risks said to be accounted for. Later Monday, in connection with the comments made by Russian officials at the Security Council meeting, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky declared that he has carried out urgent consultations with President Emmanuel Macron of France and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and called a meeting of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine. Putin also spoke with Macron and Scholz, telling them he intends to sign a decree on Donbass. According to the Kremlin, the French and German leaders expressed ""disappointment"". Eight Years of War The conflict in the Donbass has its origins in the February 2014 Maidan coup d'etat in Kiev, in which Ukraine's unpopular but democratically elected government was overthrown by political forces favouring integration with the European Union and NATO at the expense of ties with Russia. In the spring of 2014, demonstrators across eastern and southern Ukraine opposed to the new government's pro-Western orientation and perceived efforts to clamp down on the Russian-speaking regions began organising protests and independence movements. The strongest of these were concentrated in the Russia-bordering regions of Donetsk and Lugansk. Kiev responded to the independence push by trying to crush these movements with military force, leading to the formation of local militias by local residents seeking to defend their homes, and the proclamation of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics in May 2014. Elsewhere, in major eastern and southern regions including Kharkov, Nikolayev, and Odessa, anti-Kiev and pro-independence protesters were systematically jailed, assassinated, and disappeared. A full-scale civil war raged throughout Donbass between May 2014 and February of 2015, killing at least 13,000 people, injuring thousands more and prompting over 2.5 million of the region's residents to flee their homes, with over a million seeking refuge in Russia. In February 2015, the leaders of Ukraine and the three guarantor states of Russia, France, and Germany met in the Belarusian capital of Minsk to hammer out the Minsk Agreements, a comprehensive ceasefire and peace deal aimed at ending the conflict in the Donbass and reintegrating Donetsk and Lugansk back into Ukraine in exchange for broad, constitutionally mandated autonomy. Successive Ukrainian governments failed for years to make any progress on implementing the deal's political portion. In 2019, an attempt to do so by then newly elected President Volodymyr Zelensky was aborted after tens of thousands of protesters, including veterans of the Donbass war and ultra-nationalist militias, gathered in Kiev and threatened to overthrow his government. The uneasy ceasefire in the Donbass region was interrupted late last week by artillery and mortar shelling, sniper attacks, saboteur bombings, and other acts of violence, with Organisation for Security and Co-Operation in Europe observers registering hundreds of violations of the ceasefire by both sides. Last Friday, in response to the escalation, DPR and LPR leaders announced a general mobilisation and began to evacuate their civilian populations to Russia. On Monday, DPR and LPR heads Denis Pushilin and Leonid Pasechnik formally asked Putin to recognise their status as independent nations.",russian,1,1774,97.31,57.54,27.5,6.87,25.71,33.99,81,56.65,45.72,6.09,3.04,0.11,0.9,0.17,0.96,0.85,3.04,14.6,9.7,2.14,17.64,3.72,2.37,5.58,0.62,9.13,4.62,2.54,8.74,1.63,1.24,6.03,8.06,0.45,7.61,1.52,1.35,0.79,0.62,0.56,2.37,0.23,4.11,1.3,2.82,0.39,0.11,0.28,0.06,0.17,0.06,0,11.67,6.43,0.79,0.11,1.63,0.39,3.16,4.96,0.06,0.06,0.28,0.79,7.33,5.36,1.8,0.17,2.54,0,0.34,1.58,0.56,0.17,0.51,0.11,0,0.06,0,0,0,0,0.23,0.34,0.06,0.34,0.06,0.06,0,0.17,1.63,0.28,2.71,9.13,0.62,0.85,7.38,0.17,0.17,0.17,4.34,5.13,1.69,0.79,0.06,0.06,0,0,0,16.63,4.11,6.26,0.06,0,1.86,4.34

According to her, a normal exercise requires notification 42 days in advance if it is about 9,000 troops, but at 13,000, it requires international observers. ""That's what normal looks like, what this is is something entirely different,"" the official noted. ""There are many troubling things happening in Belarus right now. And there can be no doubt about Belarus his role as an increasingly destabilizing actor in the region,"" the senior Department of State official stressed. The US authorities are concerned that draft constitutional amendments may indicate Belarus’ plans to host Russia’s conventional and nuclear weapons, she noted. ""The proposed changes to the constitution include language that could be interpreted as paving the way for Russia to garrison forces on Belarusian territory,"" she said. ""These draft constitutional changes may indicate Belrus’ plans to allow both Russian conventional and nuclear forces to be stationed on its territory,"" the diplomat added. Belarus’ BelTA news agency reported on Tuesday that the country's President Alexander Lukashenko had confirmed that a nationwide constitutional referendum would take place in February. A draft of the country’s amended constitution was released on December 27. Amendments to the constitution will clarify the powers of the head of state, the government and parliament. In addition, the All-Belarusian People’s Assembly will receive additional powers. ""The discussion about nuclear weapons in Belarus is one that was started by Lukashenko in November,"" the US Department of State official said, adding that ""we should all pay attention"" to such statements. Chief of the Belarusian Defense Ministry’s International Military Cooperation Department Oleg Voinov said at a briefing for military attaches on Tuesday that the Union Resolve 2022 Belarusian-Russian drills would take place in Belarus on February 10-20 as part of an inspection of the Union State’s response forces. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said earlier that Russia had explained to the US during the recent consultations in Geneva that Moscow did not have any intention of attacking Ukraine.

Moscow believes that the US Department of State’s claims Minsk’s actions regarding the migration crisis sow division and distract attention from Russia’s activities on the border with Ukraine are wrong, Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the media on Monday. ""We regard this statement as wrong. It is a misinterpretation of the migration crisis on the Belarusian-Polish border,"" Peskov said. ""I would like to remind you that Russian President Vladimir Putin unequivocally said in an interview aired on Saturday that he absolutely ruled out any possibility of Russia’s involvement in what is happening to the migrants on the Belarusian-Polish border. In fact, the president explained why. The situation that is taking shape on the border was not created by Lukashenko. The migrants who arrive there using visa-free rules wish to seek refuge in Europe. They are denied it. They are not allowed there, but the people who are on the way there know perfectly well that in case of other countries migrants were welcomed quite hospitably,"" he added. Peskov said that blaming Lukashenko for the migration crisis on the Belarusian-Polish border was absolutely wrong. ""Putting the blame for the border situation on President Lukashenko, on the Belarusian side would be absolutely wrong. It is absolutely wrong to neglect the pan-European ideals of humanism, which [in the West] nobody wishes to recall in the context of this situation. For some reason, nobody wishes to recall the plight of the several thousand people - the refugees, who have been stranded on the border for nearly a week in very cold weather,"" Peskov said. The [US officials’] statement is fundamentally wrong and we disagree with it,"" Peskov said. Earlier, US Department of State spokesperson Ned Price issued a statement saying that Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Saturday held a telephone conversation with Poland’s Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau. ""Secretary Blinken reaffirmed U.S. support for Poland in the face of the Lukashenko regime’s cynical exploitation of vulnerable migrants,"" Price said.

Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba claims that Russia is seeking to take advantage of loopholes in European legislation to ensure special conditions for Nord Stream 2, reported local media. “But we insist that there should be no exceptions,"" emphasised Kuleba, speaking in an interview for Ukraine’s Channel 24. The Foreign Minister urged his country’s partners to close ranks and insist the European legislation be fully applied to the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline despite efforts by Russian lobbyists and lawyers. ""Together with a number of EU countries and the European Commission, Ukraine insists that Nord Stream 2 be completely in line not only with the spirit but also with the letter of the EU's Third Energy Package. We are working to prevent Russia from turning Nord Stream 2 into a Nord weapon,"" stated Kuleba. The top Ukrainian diplomat claimed that Russia was exerting pressure on the EU on several fronts of its “hybrid war” by manipulating the Nord Stream 2 certification process. ""Nord Stream 2 was long supposed to have been launched and put into operation, but the fact that it is still not working and we are fighting it is the result of our joint efforts,"" said the minister. According to Ukraine’s foreign minister, the ongoing migration crisis on the Polish-Belarus border, alleged military build-up on the part of the Russian Federation along the border with Ukraine, Russia's actions ostensibly seek to paralyse the Normandy format and the Minsk process for a Donbas settlement are “all elements of the same game, aimed to up pressure on the EU to force the bloc to accept concessions”. Western media has repeatedly reported on the alleged Russian military build-up since late last month, pointing to large-scale joint military exercises with Belarus. In response, Moscow dismissed the reports as  not corresponding to reality. Russian President Vladimir Putin, in turn, pointed to the provocative nature of the recent exercises conducted by the United States and a number of its allies in the Black Sea. Regarding Nord Stream 2, tailored to carry Russian gas to Europe along the Black Sea bed, the Ukrainian Foreign Minister insisted that it was a political project for Moscow, not a commercial one. According to Kiev, the certification of Nord Stream 2 was a question of whether Russia’s Gazprom, the owner of the project, would be granted a privileged position in the European gas market to the alleged detriment of participants and consumers, as well as of Ukraine as a transit provider of gas. Ukraine has been vehemently reiterating that European energy law requires that the operator of the pipeline - the Gazprom-owned, Swiss-registered company Nord Stream 2 AG - be fully unbundled and independent from the Russian majority state-owned multinational energy corporation, and that rules on “third-party access” as well as “non-discriminatory, transparent and cost-reflective tariffs” be applied to the entire pipeline. Nord Stream 2 Certification The Ukrainian Foreign Minister’s remarks come as the German regulator Bundesnetzagentur (BNetzA) earlier suspended the certification process for Nord Stream 2 AG, the pipeline operator, stating that it needed to form a company under German law to get an operating licence. European unbundling rules require pipeline owners to be different from suppliers of gas flowing in them to ensure fair competition. ""The certification procedure will remain suspended until the main assets and human resources have been transferred to the subsidiary and the Bundesnetzagentur is able to check whether the documentation resubmitted by the subsidiary, as the new applicant, is complete. When these requirements have been fulfilled, the Bundesnetzagentur will be able to resume its examination in the remainder of the four-month period set out in law, produce a draft decision and deliver it to the European Commission for an opinion, as provided for in the EU legislation on the internal market,"" the regulator added. The German energy regulator was also reported as having invited Ukraine’s National Joint Stock Company Naftogaz and LLC Gas Transmission System Operator (GTSOU) to the certification process, which is to be completed by January 2022. Ukraine, which currently has a gas transit agreement with Russia, has been a vocal opponent of the pipeline, fearing imminent revenue losses after its commissioning. It has also echoed claims by the US that the pipeline threatens the energy security of Ukraine and Europe. Moscow, however, has repeatedly said that it would continue relying on Ukraine's transport capacities to pump gas to Europe in the coming years despite building additional pipelines. Construction of Nord Stream 2 was completed in early September 2021. A joint venture by Russia's Gazprom and Western European energy companies ENGIE, OMV, Shell, Uniper and Wintershall Dea, Nord Stream 2 is a 1,230-km twin gas pipeline along the bottom of the Baltic Sea to complement the existing Nord Stream 1 network. The network is capable of transporting up to 1.9 trillion cubic feet (55 billion cubic metres) of gas annually from Russia to Europe, thus doubling Nord Stream's capacity. Despite long being defended by its participants as a  purely economic and not political venture, the project for the 1,230 km pipeline has been forced to tackle a plethora of challenges, ranging from negotiating operating terms and obtaining clearances from involved countries, to US sanctions, imposed in December 2019 against a key contractor,  Switzerland-based AllSeas. Washington, also driven by ambitions to sell Germany and Eastern Europe its more expensive, tanker-delivered liquefied natural gas, has long claimed the Nord Stream 2 project would leave Ukraine without money from Russian gas transit, while making Europe dependent on Russian gas – allegations that Moscow dismissed as unfounded. Last month Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia could start delivering natural gas to Europe via the Nord Stream 2 pipeline as soon as Moscow gets the green light from Berlin. “If the German regulator hands its clearance for supplies tomorrow, deliveries of 17.5 billion cubic metres [of gas] will start the day after tomorrow”, Putin emphasised.",russian,1,1024,97.24,41.79,9.94,21.42,34.13,33.59,72.56,51.76,41.31,3.71,0.68,0,0.49,0,0.1,0.1,3.03,13.67,10.25,3.42,15.63,5.47,1.95,5.37,0.59,8.79,4.69,3.71,6.05,0.88,1.95,3.42,5.86,0.2,5.66,0.68,0.88,0.78,0.49,0.39,2.44,0,1.17,0.59,0.49,0.2,0,0.1,0.1,0,0,0,5.96,2.73,0.29,0.1,0.2,0,1.56,2.83,0.29,0,0,0.1,5.37,2.83,2.54,0,5.18,0.1,0.1,4.1,0.98,0,0.29,0.1,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.49,0,0.78,0,0.59,0,0.1,0.39,0,2.15,6.25,0.49,0.98,4.39,0.49,0.1,0,3.42,2.54,2.25,0.98,0,0,0,0,0,14.75,3.13,5.96,0,0,1.17,4.49

The escalation comes after months of claims by Western officials and media that it was Russia that was preparing to ""invade"" Ukraine. Ukrainian forces have fired 18 120-mm mortar rounds at the village of Zaitsevo, a Donetsk People's Republic-controlled settlement situated on the outskirts of the town of Gorlovka, a DPR representative at the Joint Center on Control and Coordination has told journalists. ""At 19:40, shelling was recorded by armed formations of Ukraine in the direction of the village of Zaitsevo. 18 mines were fired,"" the representative said. The deployment of 120-mm mortar systems in the Donbass conflict zone is prohibited under the Minsk Agreements - the peace deal hammered out in early 2015 aimed at enforcing a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine and ultimately bringing the civil conflict to a close. The mortar fire comes amid a major escalation of mortar, artillery and small-arms fire along the line of contact between Kiev forces and Donbass militia in the past two days, with both sides reporting dozens of violations of the ceasefire and blaming the other for the violence. Lugansk People's Republic the Trilateral Contact Group representative Rodion Miroshnik warned Friday that the Ukrainian army's deployment of a large amount of tubed artillery on the line of contact would lead to massive casualties if a major military conflagration was started. ""There was shelling of a small village called Sanzhary. It is located between Debaltseve and Pervomaisk on the line of contact. 122-mm artillery was used there, that is, tubed artillery,"" Morshnik said. ""On the line of contact, we see a massive amount of cannon artillery in the 122-152 mm calibre, which can strike at distances of between 20-40 km. Let me remind you that there re just 7 km between the line of contact and the center of Donetsk, and 12 km from the positions where these weapons are deployed and the center of Lugansk. That is, if this artillery is used now, it will not be possible to avoid huge bloodshed and a massive number of victims,"" he added. Miroshnik warned that the Donbass was being pushed toward renewed fighting, since Kiev has shown its lack of readiness to negotiate with the breakaway republics. The leaders of Donetsk and Lugansk ordered an evacuation of their civilian population on Friday, citing the danger of an all-out Ukrainian assault. Speaking to reporters after meeting with his Belarusian counterpart on Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin reiterated that Kiev must sit down for talks with the Donbass breakaways, and do so as soon as possible. Putin also stressed that the Minsk Agreements were the only way to restore peace and relieve tension in the region. The war in the Donbass began in the spring of 2014, when Kiev sent the military to crush fledgling independence movements created by local residents refusing to accept the authority of new political leaders who came to power on the back of a Western-backed coup d'etat. Between May 2014 and early 2015, up to 13,000 Ukrainian troops, Donbass militiamen and civilians were killed in bloody fighting in the cities, towns, villages and plains of eastern Ukraine. In February 2015, the leaders of Ukraine and three nations acting as guarantors - Russia, Germany and France met in Minsk, Belarus to sign the Minsk peace deal. The comprehensive agreement called for an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the front line, plus local elections in the Donbass and constitutional reform in Kiev granting the self-proclaimed republics broad autonomy.

Over the three decades since the disintegration of the Soviet Union the world became significantly less safe. And in the next 30 years technology giants will become key players in geopolitics along with sovereign states, head of the Eurasia Group consulting firm, political scientist Ian Bremmer told a TASS correspondent. He said that the most major changes over this time involved ""a geopolitical recession—what I call the g-zero world. It’s a move from an American-led global order to one where there’s an absence of global leadership, and international architecture and institutions no longer functionally align with the global power balance."" For a while, the expert has been expressing a point of view that not a single country, nor an alliance, including the Group of Seven and the Group of Twenty, can shape the global political agenda on its own or be capable of decisively impacting the rest of the world. At the same time, he thinks it is still possible to talk about the decline of Russia. ""The political divisions in the United States and Europe, the decline of Russia (which blames the West for at least part of their challenges) and the rise of an unaligned China are primary reasons for this,"" the expert thinks. He also asserts that over this period, the world became much more dangerous. ""About the same on nuclear balance, sadly - which was one area that you’d think would have seen considerable improvement. [It is] considerably less safe and secure in response to big global challenges like cyber, climate, and regional power vacuums […] but with more resources to effectively respond when crises occur,"" the political scientist said. According to his forecasts, in the next 30 years, the world order will be transformed by digital giants along with governments. ""Technology companies will become geopolitical actors in their own right, with sovereignty over the digital world while governments maintain control of the physical world […] with massive implications for society, economy, and security,"" the expert said.

The unsubstantiated claims have been consistently rejected by the Kremlin. American officials have reportedly shared intelligence with European allies that includes a map outlining an alleged Russian troop ""buildup"" near the Ukrainian border, a Bloomberg exclusive has detailed. The weekend report indicates that the relayed intelligence information also shows the location of munition reserves purportedly meant to be used as part of a ""rapid, large-scale push into Ukraine from multiple locations if [Russian] President Vladimir Putin decided to invade."" One scenario reportedly outlined by the American intel paints Russian troops allegedly attempting to enter Ukraine through Crimea, the Russian border and through Belarus, which is currently in the midst of its own migrant crisis with Poland. The same scenario also suggests the use of ""about 100 battalion tactical groups"" that would amount to some 100,000 soldiers. ""Two of the people said about half that number of tactical groups was already in position and that any invasion would be backed up by air support,"" the report reads, before noting two sources with claims that ""Moscow had also called up tens of thousands of reservists."" Unsubstantiated claims that Russia is engaging in a disinformation campaign against Ukraine were also noted in the report. Citing individuals with knowledge of the development, Bloomberg detailed that the information was forwarded by the Biden administration to ""some"" NATO members over the last week as a means of proving that Russia is in the midst of plotting an invasion against Ukraine sometime within the next year. The report is the latest in a series of accusations made against Russia, which has repeatedly rejected any assertion that it is planning an invasion. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov most recently lashed out at the allegations, saying earlier that ""this hysteria is being whipped up artificially."" ""Those who bring their armed forces overseas now accuse us of some 'unusual military activity' on our own territory,"" Peskov said, in reference to the US. The official later slammed the NATO alliance and warned it against providing Ukraine with modern weaponry. ""Ukraine is most likely seeking to make another attempt at resolving its own problem through military means; create another disaster for themselves and for everyone in Europe,"" Peskov said. ""This is what Ukraine is striving for. And it is trying to achieve this, most likely, under the cover of those very NATO exercises [near Russia's borders], NATO ships in the Black Sea - US, British soldiers in the region, of which there are more and more."" Both the weekend report and Peskov's commentary came on the heels of remarks from US Secretary of State Antony Blinken that underscored his so-called ""concerns"" regarding growing reports of a Russian ""buildup"" along the Ukrainian border. Blinken's comments surfaced days after Gen. Mark Milley, who serves as the US chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters that he sees no indication that Russia is planning a military invasion.",russian,1,522,95.85,57.2,42.3,5.8,27.47,32.95,82.18,59,47.51,8.43,2.3,0,0.96,0,0.57,0.38,6.13,17.43,9.2,1.15,17.24,5.56,2.49,3.45,0.19,11.49,5.36,4.6,8.81,2.3,1.34,5.17,10.15,0.38,9.77,2.49,1.15,0.57,1.92,0.19,2.68,0,3.64,0.96,2.68,0.38,0,0.38,0,0.38,0,0,10.54,6.32,0.77,0.19,1.72,0.57,2.11,4.79,0,0,0,0.57,6.9,4.41,2.49,0,4.02,0.38,0,3.64,0,0,0.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.19,0.19,0,0,0,0,0,0.38,0.38,1.53,10.73,0.96,1.34,7.66,0.57,0,0.19,4.02,5.36,4.02,0.77,0,0,0,0,0,14.94,3.64,4.02,0,0,0.96,6.32

""Some time from now Western countries will find out that the Russian-Belarusian drills are over and Russian troops returned to Russian soil,"" he said at a news conference following talks with UK Foreign Minister Liz Truss. ""Then they will kick up a media campaign to say that the West convinced Russia to de-escalate.""

Lavrov said he hoped the West will be serious about taking on the issues of European security, which affect everyone regardless of their membership in NATO. ""I really hope that on serious issues related to European security, the security of all countries without exception, be they NATO members, Ukraine or Russia, we will behave a little more like adults and not engage in outright propaganda with an eye to the next electoral adventures,"" the minister said.

Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that Ukraine is pulling its armed forces into the conflict zone in Donbass and that half of the troops are already there. ""Ukrainian Armed Forces are building up their military strength, pulling together heavy equipment, personnel. According to some reports, the number of Ukrainian troops in the conflict zone already numbers 125,000, and this, if anyone does not know, is half of the entire composition of the Armed Forces,"" Zakharova said at a briefing on Wednesday. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that NATO was trying to drag Ukraine into its orbit and turn it into an 'anti-Russia'. “Unfortunately, the situation is seriously complicated by the openly destructive line of the NATO states, which are trying to draw Ukraine into their orbit, to turn it, in the president’s words, into ‘anti-Russia’. The supply of lethal weapons to Kiev is expanding, and provocative manoeuvres involving the United States on land, in the air and at sea near our borders are multiplying. At the same time, they are trying to dictate to us how the Russian Armed Forces should behave on our own territory,"" Lavrov said, speaking at the Federation Council. Russia will continue to react firmly to any unfriendly steps of NATO, the minister added. The NATO chief's remarks about moving nuclear weapons to Eastern Europe were reckless and aimed at conflict, Lavrov said. Commenting on Lukashenko's statement on the possibility of hosting Russian nuclear weapons in Belarus, Lavrov said it should be taken as a very serious warning to the West. In turn, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytry Kuleba took part in a meeting of the North Atlantic Council at the level of the foreign ministers of NATO member states and urged them to increase sanctions pressure on Russia. ""We will call on the allies to join Ukraine in putting together a deterrence package,"" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said. As part of this package, NATO should prepare economic sanctions to be imposed on Russia if it ""decides to choose the worst-case scenario"", he said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the Donbass conflict cannot be resolved without direct Kiev-Moscow dialogue. ""I am not afraid of direct dialogue with them [Russia]. We are not afraid of direct dialogue. We know which of the European countries support Ukraine, it is true, and we are grateful to them. We know which of the European countries pretends to support Ukraine and our independence,"" Zelenskyy told lawmakers, adding that it is impossible to stop the war ""without direct negotiations with Russia."" In 2014, Ukraine initiated a military operation against the eastern regions of Donetsk and Lugansk, known together as Donbass, after they unilaterally proclaimed independence following the change of government in Kiev, which they considered a coup. The Ukrainian government has blamed the crisis on the east on Russia, but Moscow has denied any involvement in the internal Ukrainian conflict.A Normandy format of negotiations involving Russia, France, Germany, and Ukraine was set up in June 2014 to settle the conflict in southeastern Ukraine.

In 2012, Obama Secretary of State Hillary Clinton alleged that Moscow’s efforts to promote Eurasian economic integration of the former USSR was a “move to re-Sovietise the region.” Undersecretary of state for political affairs Victoria Nuland is perfectly aware that rebuilding the Soviet Union is impossible and not on the cards, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. “Mrs. Nuland is well-versed on the subject of Russia and all the nuances of the post-Soviet space, and I am convinced that like us, and like other specialists, Mrs. Nuland understands perfectly well that the restoration of the Soviet Union is impossible,” Peskov said, speaking to reporters on Wednesday. Peskov stressed that none of the integration projects taking place in the post-Soviet space today constitutes anything resembling an attempt to reincarnate the USSR. “Mrs. Nuland surely knows that integration processes with different speeds appeared in the former Soviet space a long time ago and are maturing. This includes the Commonwealth of Independent States, more advanced organizations such as the Eurasian Economic Community and the yet more advanced union state structure, such as the Union State of Russia and Belarus. But none are an attempt to reincarnate the Soviet Union and cannot become such,” the spokesman said. Peskov further suggested that recreating the Soviet Union was impossible because the states which appeared in its place in late 1991 have had sufficient time to establish and strengthen themselves as independent entities. Putin’s ‘Legacy Project' The Kremlin spokesman’s comments followed claims by Nuland in testimony before the US Senate on Tuesday in which she suggested that Russian President Vladimir Putin may have among his “legacy” goals a project to rebuild the Soviet Union. In her comments, Nuland expressed “concern” about “Putin’s public lamentations and private lamentations about the demise of the Soviet Union,” suggesting that they had “gotten noisier and stronger over the years.” “Just in the last year, in the last six months he has increased his public comments to the effect that the sovereign nation of Ukraine is actually a part of Russia, belongs to Russia, etc.,” Nuland said, offering a novel interpretation of Putin’s essay ‘On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians,’ published in July, in which he stressed the importance of friendly ties between Moscow and Kiev, and pointed to Russian diplomatic efforts to stop the “fratricidal” civil war in eastern Ukraine. “The concern is that he is actually as a legacy project seeking to reconstitute the Soviet Union, and then would his appetite be fulfilled with that eating or would he seek to go further. So I think this is why the unity here in the Senate, unity in the House, unity within the United States, unity in Ukraine, unity with our NATO allies and partners, and the significant consequences that we’re talking about are so important,” Nuland said. Nuland served as assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs in the Obama State Department and played a key role in the US-led effort to overthrow the Ukrainian government in early 2014. Publicly, she appeared on the streets of Kiev and passed out cookies to protesters. Privately, she negotiated the future transfer of power to Ukraine’s opposition forces, famously quipping “f*ck the EU” in a leaked telephone conversation with then US ambassador to Ukraine Jeoffrey Pyatt while referring to Brussels’ initial hesitation to overthrowing the elected government in Kiev outright. Putin on the Soviet Union's Fate The Russian president has said repeatedly that he has no aspirations to rebuild the Soviet Union, famously quipping in 2008 that he considered the country’s collapse a “huge geopolitical catastrophe,” but adding that while “whoever does not miss the Soviet Union has no heart, whoever wants it back has no brain.” In 2014, Putin told Western news agencies that claim Moscow is looking to restore its ""empire"" are made up. “They try to stick this label on us – a label that we are trying to restore an empire, the Soviet Union, make everyone subordinate. This absolutely does not correspond to reality. It is a media weapon of war,” he said at the time. Wednesday marked the 30th anniversary ofthe Belovezh Accords – the agreement between Russian Soviet republic president Boris Yeltsin and his Ukrainian and Belarusian republic counterparts to formally dissolve the USSR and establish the Commonwealth of Independent States. The agreement was signed less than nine months after the March 1991 referendum on the future of the Soviet Union, in which 77.85 percent of voters, including 75.4 percent of Russians, 83 percent of Belarusians, and 81.7 percent of Ukrainians voted in favour of preserving the country. Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev has characterized the Belovezh Accords as “illegal,” and suggested that such a question could only have been decided via referendum.

""The destabilizing and dangerous nature of the provocative activities of the armed forces of the United States and a number of other NATO countries in the Black Sea was also noted,"" the Kremlin said in a statement. Earlier this month, the US Sixth Fleet announced that its flagship Mount Whitney departed to the Black Sea to conduct drills with NATO allies and partners. On Monday, Mount Whitney along with US destroyer Porter entered the Georgian port of Batumi. Ukraine welcomed the presence of the alliance's forces near Crimea which it considers to be its annexed territory. The peninsula rejoined Russia in 2014 as a result of a referendum, which saw the vast majority of the population voting in favor of the reunification. Moscow, for its part, sees NATO activities in the Black Sea as a provocation to spur tensions and pursue the policy of containment of Russia. Putin and Merkel also continued discussing the situation on the borders between Belarus and the EU member states. They already discussed the situation during another phone conversation on Wednesday.""The discussion of the situation on the borders of Belarus with the EU countries was continued.

""If Russia faces aggression from Ukraine, we will be closely teaming up — economically, legally, and politically — with Russia. This is the main thing,” Lukashenko said. He stressed that he would never be ""on the side of the nationalist intoxication that is taking place in Ukraine today."" “I will do everything to make Ukraine ours. It is our Ukraine, our people there. These are not emotions, this is my firm conviction,” the head of the Belarusian state said. Lukashenko previously announced his plans to visit Crimea, saying that his trip would mean its recognition as part of Russia by Minsk. ""We all understood that Crimea is de facto Russian Crimea. After the referendum, Crimea became Russian de jure."" ""We have a definite agreement with [Russian President Vladimir] Putin that we will spend time in Crimea,"" Lukashenko said, adding that he has been invited to the peninsula. Following the February 2014 coup in Ukraine, an overwhelming majority of people in Crimea voted in March 2014 to secede from the country and rejoin Russia in a referendum that Kiev and its Western allies rejected as illegal. Moscow has emphasised that the referendum was carried out in accordance with international law. On Tuesday, the Belarusian president said that Minsk would suggest that Moscow deploy nuclear weapons in Belarus if similar NATO systems appear in Poland. The proposal was voiced shortly after NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that the alliance might move nuclear weapons to the eastern European countries if Germany refuses to deploy them.  The Belarusian leader's comments come amid simmering tensions between Russia, on the one hand, and Ukraine and NATO, on the other hand. Over the past weeks, NATO and Kiev have accused Russia of preparing to invade Ukraine, something Moscow has consistently denied as absurd. Earlier, Lukashenko said that Belarusian-Ukrainian political relations are at their lowest point. Ukraine is one of the countries that Belarus, along with the Western countries, accused of interfering in its internal affairs; additionally, last year's opposition protests were coordinated from its territory. Relations between Kiev and Minsk deteriorated when the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, after Lukashenko's inauguration last year, announced that it did not consider him a legitimate president. Blocking Transit of Energy Resources Other than Ukraine, the Belarusian president has reiterated his readiness to suspend the transit of energy resources should Poland follow through with its threats to close the border. ""The Poles decided to close the border with Belarus. Alright, close it. We do not go to the European Union very often. Our interest today is in Russia, China and the East most of all. What if I close [the transit route]? What will then happen to this flow, which mainly goes through us to Russia, China?"" Lukashenko said in an interview with RIA Novosti. He then challenged Warsaw to close the Belarus border and see who will end up in a more disadvantaged situation. Earlier this month, Lukashenko warned the EU that Belarus could stop gas transit, saying that the bloc needed to think about the transit of Russian gas via Belarus before imposing new sanctions against Minsk. At the time, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Lukashenko was entitled to make such a decision, but it would violate transit contracts. He expressed hope that it won't happen. Late last month, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that Warsaw did not rule out the possibility of closing the borders with Belarus over the ongoing migration crisis. Lukashenko told RIA Novosti that Minsk will try to resolve the issue with refugees on the Belarusian-Polish border until the end of the year. The EU's refusal to build refugee camps and sanctions became reasons for the migration crisis on Belarusian borders, Lukashenko believes. The president revealed that Belarus has spent about $25 million on aid to refugees on the border with Poland, clarifying that this refers to the costs of providing migrants with food, treatment, and heating. In recent months, Poland, Latvia, and Lithuania have reported an increase in the number of asylum-seekers, mostly from the Middle East and North Africa, trying to illegally cross the border from Belarus, accusing Minsk of using migrants as a ""hybrid weapon"" against the bloc after it imposed sanctions on the country. Belarus denied all the allegations, saying it could no longer suppress migration to neighboring countries due to lack of resources caused by Western  sanctions against the country.",russian,1,752,91.4,54.35,32.97,6.47,19.79,30.19,78.72,59.04,45.74,9.44,3.32,0.4,1.33,0,1.2,0.27,6.12,15.43,8.38,0.66,15.56,5.85,1.86,4.39,0.93,12.9,5.19,2.66,6.78,1.99,0.53,4.26,8.91,1.06,7.85,1.73,0.66,1.6,1.46,0.13,2.53,0,3.32,0.8,2.39,0.8,0.13,0.53,0.27,0.27,0,0,10.77,5.59,0.93,0,1.6,0.53,2.66,4.92,0,0,0,1.2,7.05,4.79,1.99,0.27,1.86,0,0.13,1.2,0.53,0,0.93,0.13,0,0,0,0.13,0,0.13,0,0.4,0.13,0.13,0.13,0,0,0,0.53,0,4.12,9.84,0.13,1.06,8.24,0.4,0,0.27,4.52,4.65,2.39,1.86,0.13,0,0.13,0,0,15.43,4.79,6.25,0.27,0,0.66,3.46

US undersecretary of state Wendy Sherman has called on Russia to step up its efforts to ensure Europe’s energy security ahead of winter. “Deputy Secretary Sherman called on Russia to do more to ensure European energy security while also echoing [US climate] Secretary [John] Kerry’s call for it to submit a strengthened nationally determined contribution under the Paris Agreement by the time COP 26 meets on October 31,” the State Department said in a press release. The statement followed a meeting between Sherman, undersecretary of state for economic affairs Jose Fernandez and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexei Overchuk on Thursday to discuss bilateral relations between Russia and the US. Sherman’s request comes after years of efforts by Washington to suffocate the recently completed Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline via sanctions, pressure on regional allies, and environmentalism-based machinations to try to sabotage the project. The pipeline, which is expected to become technically ready for operation in the coming days, pending German and European Union regulatory approval, promises to deliver up to an additional 55 billion cubic meters of Russian gas to a hub in Germany each year, thereby doubling the capacity of the Nord Stream network, and complementing supplies sent through existing ground-based pipelines running through Belarus and Ukraine. Sherman’s comments follow weeks of claims by US officials that Russia was somehow responsible for the gas shortages and the corresponding spike in energy prices facing Europe. Late last month, Amos Hochstein, a senior advisor to the State Department on energy security issues, said that the US was “concerned” about Europe running out of gas for heating and power this winter, and blamed Russia’s alleged “inexplicably low” deliveries of gas compared to previous years, especially deliveries through Ukraine. US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan echoed the State Department’s allegations, accusing Moscow of using its energy resources as a “weapon.” Russian officials vocally denied the allegations, with the Kremlin saying that all of Russia’s European energy partners have conceded that Moscow is fully implementing its supply obligations, willing to ramp up supplies further if asked at a moment’s notice. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov called Sullivan’s claims “shameless,” telling the BBC last week that Russia has been and remains “the most reliable and safe supplier of natural resources” to Europe, and is ready to cooperate with regional nations to stabilize prices. President Vladimir Putin commented on the issue on Wednesday, stressing that systemic flaws in Europe’s energy sector, not Russia, were to blame for the current supply crisis, and that it wasn’t worth trying to “lay one’s own fault at someone else’s door.” Moscow, Putin pointed out, has increased its gas sales by 15 percent this year, even as the US, which has blamed Moscow for the crunch, has reduced their LNG deliveries to Europe. Putin stressed that Russian energy producers were interested in stable, long-term prices, not short-term profits, since high prices would inevitably cause “negative consequences for everyone, including producers,” over the long term if industries and utilities were forced to reduce consumption or shut down altogether. On Friday, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said that Gazprom was ready to further grow its gas production capacity if Europe increased its volume of long-term contracts with the Russian gas giant. Europe’s gas supply crunch has a number of objective factors, including a new-found preference for short-term contracts with suppliers, depleted gas reserves caused by an unusually cold winter of 2020-2021 and the failure to refill them sufficiently ahead of the new heating season, market speculation, intense competition for supplies with Asia, and a poorer than expected payoff on investments into alternative sources of energy such as solar and wind power. Russia accounts for up to half of Europe’s gas supplies. Norway, Algeria and Qatar contribute more than a quarter of the rest.",russian,1,675,97.54,49.76,21.53,16.83,37.5,33.93,74.96,52.15,38.96,5.04,1.19,0,0.74,0,0,0.44,3.85,10.96,6.52,1.33,17.63,3.41,1.04,4.74,0.44,7.85,4.89,4.59,4.44,1.19,0.89,2.52,6.22,0.3,5.78,0.59,1.33,0.59,1.04,0.3,2.07,0,3.11,1.33,1.63,0.59,0,0.44,0.3,0,0,0,8.3,4.89,0.74,0.15,0.15,0.74,2.52,3.41,0,0,0,0,4.44,3.11,1.33,0,6.37,0,0,4.89,1.93,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.3,0,0.74,0.15,0.44,0,0.3,1.19,0.3,1.63,7.85,1.19,0.89,5.48,0,0.3,0.44,5.33,3.56,1.93,1.19,0,0,0,0,0,15.56,2.67,6.37,0,0,2.37,4.15

On December 17, Moscow presented draft agreements between Russia, the United States and NATO on security guarantees, which, if agreed to, would prevent NATO from expanding eastwards and prohibit the US and Russia from stationing intermediate and shorter-range ballistic missiles within striking distance of each other's territory, among other things. Moscow and Washington are expected to hold negotiations on the security guarantees on January 10. It will be followed by a Russia-NATO Council meeting on the Russian security proposals on January 12 and a summit of Russia and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe on January 13. According to Thomas Shea, an adjunct senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists, this series of interconnected meetings sets the stage for a diplomatic conference that could result in Ukraine becoming a neutral country and creation of a framework treaty that would decrease the risks of armed conflict. ""We might hope four five-party talks on such an arrangement: Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, NATO and the U.S. It is time for evidence of good faith to be shown by all five, following a time-line to the future. All five should view this as a remarkable development, but especially fragile during these times of high tension. The opening meetings will see all five voicing their respective wishes and conditions,"" Shea said. Nikolai Sokov, a senior fellow at the Vienna Center for Disarmament and Nonproliferation, thinks that the US took Russia's suggestions seriously as a sign that the situation around Ukraine may escalate to dangerous levels. ""Of course, there are limits to what Washington may contemplate but at least a serious dialogue can begin,"" Sokov opined. The expert stated that the issue of NATO's non-expansion is a non-starter for the US, but everything else can be discussed. However, if Moscow insists on the alliance not admitting new members the deal is dead on arrival. ""There can only be a de facto, tacit agreement not to admit Ukraine and Georgia in the foreseeable future; there can also be a tacit agreement on limits to extending NATO military infrastructure to these countries, but nothing formal,"" Sokov said, adding that ""a compromise is possible, of course, but there are limits to what would be acceptable to both Washington and Moscow."" He also explained that the Russia-US strategic stability dialogue on arms control has its own dynamic, with the main question being whether or not Washington would agree to discuss ""areas other than strategic nuclear weapons – long-range conventional and missile defense first of all."" ""So far, it does not seem an agreement on that central disagreement is within reach, though. Consultations on European security and NATO so far appear a separate track,"" Sokov explained. Meanwhile, M. V. Ramana, the Simons Chair in Disarmament, Global and Human Security at the School of Public Policy and Global Affairs and the director of the Liu Institute for Global Issues at the University of British Columbia, noted that the talks between the US and Russia involve other parties as well. ""Besides the United States and Russia, the security concerns of various countries near the border with Russia and in Eastern Europe are also at stake. Proposals that might be problematic to them might not be acceptable. Further, it is likely that US interlocutors will insist on Russia giving various guarantees in exchange,"" Ramana said. Nevertheless, despite the multiple differences between the sides, there is hope that Moscow and Washington will come through with new security arrangements.

""We are ready to close new crossings, transit and trade opportunities in order to exert economic pressure,"" the prime minister said. ""Nowadays, on the eastern border of Poland, we are dealing with a new type of war, in which migrants and disinformation serve as weapons, we are facing a hybrid war,"" the head of the government stated, blaming the Belarusian and Russian leadership for what was happening. According to the prime minister, apart from the migration crisis, the ""artificially provoked energy crisis"" and ""Russia’s growing military activity near Ukraine"" pose a threat to the eastern borders of the EU and NATO. The migrant crisis escalated dramatically on November 8 at the border of Belarus with Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, where migrants have been flocking to since the beginning of 2021. Several thousand people have approached the Polish border from Belarusian territory and are not leaving the border area. Some of them tried to storm into Poland by getting over the barbed wire fence.

While Minsk is accused of retaliating against Brussels’ sanctions by using what has been dubbed a ""hybrid weapon"", Belarus stressed it has no resources to stop the  migrants due to sanctions imposed by the EU. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has publicly intervened in the migrant crisis unfolding on the Poland-Belarus border, telling Russia’s President Vladimir Putin the Kremlin had a “clear responsibility” to end Minsk’s attempt to use “desperate migrants as pawns” to destabilise the region. Writing for The Telegraph, Truss warned that the UK was prepared to act “robustly, decisively and relentlessly” in response to “malign actions, wherever they are in the world”. “Russia has a clear responsibility here. They must press the Belarusian authorities to end the crisis and enter into dialogue,” wrote Truss. The UK Foreign Secretary echoed the earlier statements of some EU countries, such as Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, as well as the US, denouncing the “shameful manufactured migrant crisis” that she claimed was being stoked at Europe’s eastern borders. Truss insisted that Britain would “not look away” in a situation when its European allies were being forced to “bear the brunt” of a “carefully crafted crisis” designed to distract from a “litany of abhorrent acts and human rights violations” ostensibly perpetrated by Alexander Lukashenko’s government. “We will stand with our allies in the region, who are on the frontier of freedom. We are not just standing side by side with Poland as they bear the brunt of this shameful manufactured migrant crisis, but also others in the Visegrad Four – Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic – and our friends in the Baltics and Ukraine,” said Liz Truss. Truss also urged the European Union to reconsider dependence on Russia for gas supplies by cancelling the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Nord Stream 2, the 745-mile pipeline which consists of two tubes with a total capacity of 55 billion cubic meters per year, was completed on 10 September. It is set to deliver gas from Russia to Germany via the Baltic Sea. Currently, the process of certifying Nord Stream 2 AG as the pipeline’s independent operator is underway to ensure the project complies with the conditions of the 12 February EU Gas Directive. Truss, however, appealed to the EU to block the approval of Nord Stream 2, reiterating earlier allegations by the US and the UK that the project risks rendering Europe more dependent on Russian gas. Furthermore, fervent critics of the project have argued that it gave Russia increased leverage over Ukraine by cutting it out as a transit country. “It risks undermining European security by allowing Russia to tighten its grip on those nations who rely on its gas, despite the pandemic reminding us about the importance of having diverse supply chains to avoid being strategically dependent on unreliable partners,” Truss said of Nord Stream 2. In response to all allegations, Moscow has repeatedly voiced assurances that there is no political component to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and that it is a purely economic project not intended to be used as leverage against Europe, as Washington has suggested. The British Foreign Secretary went on to underscore that her nation “should be deepening investment and trade ties with countries that follow the rules and allow free market economies to thrive. We cannot, and will not, ever give succour to those who want to undermine freedom and democracy”. The remarks by the UK Foreign Secretary come after on 11 November the UK sent a small team of military personnel to Poland, with the 10 soldiers to visit the border at the request of the Polish government to help repair or reinforce the fencing. According to the Ministry of Defence, the mission was focused only on “engineering support to address the ongoing situation at the Belarus border”. The recent statements by UK officials come amid their fear that the current migrant crisis at Poland’s border could spill over to Britain. Many of the migrants seeking entry into the EU may potentially travel through France in an attempt to cross the English Channel to subsequently reach Britain. Almost 1,200 illegal immigrants arrived in the UK on 11 November on small inflatable boats from France and Belgium, setting a new daily record. More than 23,500 have made the crossing from France so far this year, a sharp rise on the 8,404 in 2020. With the UK government paying instalments of £54 million to France to help stem the flow of small boats, MPs are slamming the French for not doing more. ‘Thoughtless’ Policy of the EU Regarding the situation on the Polish-Belarus border, Russian President Vladimir Putin, in a conversation with outgoing German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 11 November, urged the importance of an early settlement of the “acute migration crisis”, in accordance with international humanitarian standards. Putin also called for the restoration of communication between the EU countries and Belarus to solve the issue. Belarus has dismissed all accusations that it is waging a ""hybrid war"" against the European Union on the Belarusian-Polish border. Everything that is happening is the result of the “thoughtless policy of the EU, connected with the statehood devastation in a number of countries, and also with the fact that they had invited refugees and declared that they are ready to shelter them,"" according to Belarus Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has also underscored that the migrant flows currently seen at the border of Belarus and Poland resulted from the policy NATO and EU countries have been pursuing in the Middle East and North Africa for years. He referred to the US-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and Western-backed Arab Spring uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa. He also urged the EU to offer financial assistance to Belarus to deal with the influx.",russian,1,985,97.61,48.5,11.39,6.86,28.97,29.24,75.63,54.82,45.99,5.48,2.03,0,0.61,0,0.41,0.71,3.45,15.13,10.76,2.34,17.36,4.97,2.34,4.87,0.81,8.73,4.06,2.23,4.16,1.32,0.3,2.54,7.01,0.61,6.29,0.41,2.23,0.61,0.41,0.2,1.93,0.1,3.55,1.02,2.54,0.71,0,0.71,0.2,0.2,0,0,8.73,5.28,1.12,0.2,0.61,0.81,2.03,3.55,0,0.1,0.2,0.2,5.58,3.45,2.23,0.1,2.74,0,0,2.23,0.71,0,0.1,0.1,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.02,0.1,0.1,0.2,0.1,0,0,1.32,0,2.03,8.12,0.61,1.32,6.19,0.2,0.1,0.1,2.64,3.05,2.94,0.81,0,0,0,0,0,12.89,3.45,4.26,0,0,0.81,4.37

""We must constantly monitor the situation on the border. Let them scream and cry. Yes, these are bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons. But we have no other way out. We must see what they are doing outside,"" the head of state said.

The ministry also issued a statement, pointing to Poland’s inadequate behavior as the Polish authorities amassed 15,000 troops, the armor and air defense capabilities on the border with Belarus over the migration crisis. As the Belarusian Defense Ministry pointed out, these moves more resemble the creation of a strike group and run counter to bilateral agreements between Warsaw and Minsk.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is hoping Russia will recognise the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, since this would enable him to avoid implementing the political portion of the Minsk Agreements, Strana.ua reports, citing sources close to the Ukrainian presidential administration. Kiev has no plans for direct negotiations with the Donbass breakaway regions, and seeks to avoid making changes to Ukraine's Constitution to provide them with a special autonomous status, as required by the Minsk deal, sources say.

This is also why Zelensky has no desire to move to advance Minsk II [the 2015 agreement containing the political reform requirements]. On the contrary, there is a desire to drag the process out until Russia recognises the DPR and the LNR and the problem resolves itself"", one source indicated. According to the outlet, Kiev is looking to take advantage of the dramatic escalation in the Donbass area seen in recent days to avoid fulfilling promises recently made to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to move forward with Minsk II. ""The escalation in the Donbass can be used as an excuse to delay the fulfillment of obligations Zelensky gave to Scholz, and to allow him to say that nothing will happen until the situation normalises"", one of Strana.ua’s sources noted. The outlet's sources also confirmed that neither Zelensky nor those close to him seriously believe in the threat of a Russian ""invasion"" of Ukraine, despite months of claims by Western officials and media citing an ""imminent"" Russian incursion. In an interview with RBK Ukraina last week, Zelensky confirmed that the German chancellor and French President Emmanuel Macron had insisted on the Minsk Agreements' implementation. Zelensky characterised the peace deal as ""botched"" and complained that ""it is designed in such a way as to make us weaker from the start, to be in a losing position"". Publicly, however, Zelensky appeared to have assured Scholz and Macron of Kiev's preparedness to continue working on the Minsk Agreements, something mentioned publicly by Macron and recently by Scholz in his talks with Russia's Vladimir Putin in Moscow. ""President Zelensky said firmly yesterday that the Trilateral Contact Group, within which the Minsk process is taking place…will soon be presented with all three texts of the envisaged bills – on the status of Ukraine, amendments to the constitution, and preparations for elections. This is good progress to build on"", Scholz told reporters last Tuesday following his talks with the Russian president. Two days later, the self-proclaimed Donbass republics reported a dramatic escalation of shelling, mortar attacks, and sniper fire by Ukrainian forces, culminating in the decision by republican leaders Friday to announce a general mobilisation and to begin the evacuation of their civilian populations to Russia. President Putin reiterated Russia's position on the conflict in eastern Ukraine on Friday. ""The guarantee to restoring peace in Ukraine and relieving tension around this country lies in the implementation of the Minsk Agreements. All Kiev needs to do is sit down at the negotiating table with representatives of the Donbass and agree on political, military, economic and humanitarian measures to end this conflict. The sooner this happens, the better"", Putin said. Also last week, the Russian Duma approved an appeal to the president asking him to grant Russian recognition to the self-proclaimed Donbass republics. DPR and LPR heads Denis Pushilin and Leonid Pasechnik welcomed the move. In his talks with Scholz, Putin stressed that the potential of the Minsk Agreements has not yet been exhausted. Minsk II was signed in the Belarusian capital on 12 February 2015, after months of heavy fighting between Ukrainian troops and separatist forces in eastern Ukraine. The civil conflict in Ukraine began in the spring of 2014, when the Ukrainian government sent troops to crush nascent independence movements which sprang up in the aftermath of a US and EU-backed coup d'état in Kiev in February of that year. The subsequent Ukrainian crisis resulted in the most serious deterioration of relations between the West and Russia since the Cold War.",russian,1,723,98.77,49.11,26.51,14.21,28.92,32.5,77.59,55.33,44.4,4.29,1.52,0,0.28,0,0.97,0.28,2.77,15.21,11.07,1.24,18.53,3.73,2.07,5.39,0.83,9.82,3.87,2.07,6.5,0.69,1.11,4.84,8.85,0.69,8.16,1.24,2.9,0.97,0.69,0.55,1.38,0,4.15,1.66,2.21,1.24,0.41,0.55,0.14,0,0,0,8.71,4.98,0.14,0.14,0.97,0.28,2.35,3.46,0,0,0,0.97,5.81,3.6,2.21,0,2.07,0,0,1.8,0.28,0,0.41,0.28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.55,0.41,0.28,0,0.28,0.14,0.14,0.97,0,2.35,9.41,0.28,0.69,7.47,0.55,0,0.41,5.81,2.77,2.9,1.8,0.14,0,0.14,0,0,13.83,3.87,4.98,0,0,1.52,3.46

Trump Leaves White House , Taliban Retakes Kabul , But Mostly That Infernal Virus",English,Russia,"The year began with a riot at the Capitol in Washington DC and ended with President Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin holding talks, but what happened in between and how many people died from COVID-19? Years come in all shapes and sizes - 1918 and 1945 were both pretty big ones globally and 2001 turned out to be a pretty significant year for the United States, Afghanistan and ultimately Iraq. There was no way 2021 was in the same league as those red-letter dates, but it was a very significant year for certain people - Joe Biden, Angela Merkel and Max Verstappen, for example. So what were the highlights of the year? January - Capitol Riot 2021 began with Donald Trump in the White House, still refusing to admit he had lost the presidential election. On 6 January, thousands of Trump supporters from across the United States, including members of the right-wing Proud Boys, came to Washington DC to take part in a rally. Trump told the rally the election had been “stolen by emboldened radical-left Democrats” and he said: “We fight. We fight like hell and if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.” Trump supporters, some of them carrying Confederate flags and Gadsen flags, converged on the Capitol and broke through the flimsy police cordon, entering the building as Vice President Mike Pence presided over a Senate session. Pence was evacuated by his bodyguards and the senators, including Nancy Pelosi, fled the mob as they began breaking in through windows and kicking open doors. Moments later, Trump supporter and US Air Force veteran Ashli Babbitt, 35, was shot dead by a security guard as she attempted to break through a door into the chamber of the House of Representatives. Brian Sicknick, a police officer who was pepper-sprayed by the rioters, suffered two strikes and later died. When he was accused of fomenting the riot, Trump pointed out he had told his supporters to make their voices heard “peacefully and patriotically”. Two weeks later, Joe Biden entered the White House, and Trump became the first outgoing President in 150 years to refuse to attend his successor’s inauguration. Trump is still being investigated for his role in the Capitol riot and his alleged failure to take action. February - Myanmar Coup And Protests On 1 February, a military coup d’etat in Myanmar - formerly known as Burma - ousted the governing National League for Democracy (NLD) and its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi. Army chief Min Aung Hlaing claimed there had been voter fraud in the November 2020 election, which saw the NLD defeat pro-military candidates. General Min Aung Hlaing named himself prime minister for a year and promised new elections in 2022. But thousands of protesters came onto the streets of the biggest city, Yangon, and there were also demonstrations in the capital, Naypyidaw, and in Mandalay and several other towns. The military reacted violently, shooting and beating protesters. The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (Burma), which is based over the border in Thailand, says more than 1,300 people have been killed since the coup and 11,000 have been arrested. In June, General Min Aung Hlaing gave an interview to Sputnik and said the protesters’ goal was to get other countries to interfere in Myanmar’s affairs as he accused Britain and the US of wanting to put its puppets in control of the country. March - Beginning Of The End For Bibi On 23 March, Israelis went to the polls for the fourth time in two years and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu finally lost power. The Likud Party of “Bibi” - as he is universally known - lost seven seats and was unable to cobble together another coalition government. Eventually, after months of haggling, Yair Lapid, the leader of the liberal Yesh Atid party, agreed to a deal with Naftali Bennett, whose conservative Yamina bloc had gained seats. In June, Bennett became the prime minister but will hold the post only until August 2023 when he will hand the position over to Mr Lapid. The coalition also includes Labor, the Blue and White Party, Yisrael Beiteinu and the United Arab List and is likely to be as unstable as the four previous governments. Clashes between Palestinians and Israeli security forces in East Jerusalem broke out in May after six Palestinian families in Sheikh Jarrah were ordered to be evicted to make way for Jewish settlers. Hamas in Gaza soon became involved and fired dozens of rockets into Israel, with the Israelis retaliating with air strikes. March - Stuck In Suez A few miles west there was another international crisis in March, but this time it had nothing to do with Israel or the Palestinians. On 23 March, the Ever Given, a 1,312 foot-long container ship, got stuck in the Suez Canal while travelling from China to the Netherlands. The vessel became wedged in the canal after running aground. For the next six days a huge traffic jam was created in the canal, the Red Sea and the eastern Mediterranean as 372 vessels queued to get through the waterway, which gives ships a short cut in the route between Asia and Europe. They included 180 bulk carriers, 24 crude oil tankers, 98 container ships, and 29 ships carrying Liquefied Natural Gas or Liquefied Petroleum Gas. The Ever Given was impounded by the Egyptians, who demanded US$550 million in compensation but was eventually released in July after a deal was made with its owners and insurers. April - Fans Reject Super League Twelve of Europe’s richest clubs wanted to be even richer and in April they floated plans for a European Super League. AC Milan, Arsenal, Atletico Madrid, Chelsea, Barcelona, Inter Milan, Juventus, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Real Madrid and Tottenham Hotspur wanted to set up a league which would operate in a similar way to the NFL in the United States, with no promotion and relegation. The slogan was: “The best clubs. The best players. Every week.” But the idea went down like a lead balloon, especially in England, where supporters held demonstrations at Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United. Within days the six English clubs had pulled out of the Super League and, in the case of Liverpool, begged the forgiveness of their fans. Manchester United CEO Ed Woodward was forced to resign. Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus soldiered on for a few days until it became clear the idea was a non-starter. May - The Roman Protasevich Affair A Ryanair flight from Greece to Lithuania was forced to land in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, after a bomb threat was made and a military jet scrambled. Once the plane, operated by Ryanair’s Polish subsidiary Buzz, was on the ground the Belarusian authorities detained two of its passengers, Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega. The couple, who had been living in Vilnius, were returning home after attending an economic forum in Athens and Protasevich, a Belarus-born journalist who co-founded the banned Telegram channel Nexta, claimed the bomb threat was a ruse. Protasevich is still waiting to find out what he will be charged with but earlier this month Sapega, who is Russian, was charged with incitement of social enmity and discord; violation of information security, regulations on handling personal data and threats against law enforcement officers. In June, sanctions were imposed on several Belarusian individuals and entities by Britain, Canada, the US and the European Union in retaliation for the Ryanair incident. The then-UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said: “The Lukashenko regime endangered the lives of airline passengers and crew in a shameful ruse to snatch Roman Protasevich. We will hold the regime to account in co-ordination with our allies including through further banning travel, freezing assets and cutting off oil export revenue streams.” July - The Pegasus Scandal A major investigation, published by various media platforms and rights groups, said spyware made by an Israeli cyber company, NSO, had been used to hack the phones of political leaders, journalists, and activists across the globe. It was reported Pegasus can be installed remotely without the need to trick a user into downloading it and once it is on, the smartphone is effectively a pocket spy. Pegasus can switch on a phone's camera or microphone and steal data from the phone without the owner being aware. Time and space: we’re looking back on a year of many milestones in @NASA planetary science – and 2021 isn't even over yet! Here are just some of the highlights: https://t.co/4R5vG5sFJt pic.twitter.com/KVz6Kh4MOE— NASA Solar System (@NASASolarSystem) December 22, 2021 Opposition MPs in Hungary demanded an inquiry after a investigation by a group of media outlets claimed Viktor Orban’s government bought the Pegasus malware to spy on journalists, politicians and businessmen who had been critical of the prime minister. It was also claimed Pegasus was used to spy on Princess Haya - the ex-wife of the ruler of Dubai - and her divorce lawyer Fiona Shackleton. Germany’s then-Chancellor, Angela Merkel, said: “It is important that software designed for specific situations does not fall into the wrong hands...It should not be sold to countries, where judicial oversight of such attacks may not be available.” July/August - Tokyo Olympics After being delayed by 12 months by the coronavirus pandemic, the 32nd Olympiad took place in and around Tokyo. But COVID-19 restrictions meant empty stadiums and masks being worn on the podiums. Tokyo was picked over Istanbul and Madrid for the honour of hosting the games but by the time they started on 23 July, it probably felt like a poison chalice. Certainly public opinion in Japan was divided, with many people against the Games taking place because of the fear of spreading the virus. The Games themselves provided the usual drama - Norway’s Karsten Warholm broke his own record over the 400m hurdles and compatriot Jakob Ingebrigtsen won the 1,500m while Jamaica’s Elaine Thompson-Herah won gold in the 100m and 200m and led the 4x100m women’s team to victory. July/August - Haiti Hit By Double Whammy In the early hours of 7 July, a band of hired assassins burst into the home of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse and gunned him down in front of his wife, Martine, who survived her own injuries. It was later reported the President’s left eye had been gouged out by the killers, during the attack in the exclusive Pelerin 5 neighbourhood. The attackers were soon rounded up by Haitian police and turned out to be 26 Colombians - mostly former soldiers - and two Haitian-Americans who claimed they had been hired on the internet to provide translation between the Spanish-speaking Colombians and French-speaking Haitians. An investigation led to Christian Emmanuel Sanon, 63, a Florida-based Haitian-American doctor who reportedly hired the assassins and apparently harboured ideas of being installed as President himself. One of the Colombians reportedly described them as “useful idiots” who had been duped. But Haiti had further misfortune around the corner. At 8.30 a.m. on 14 August a magnitude 7.2 earthquake hit Haiti. The quake, epicentred on the Tiburon peninsula in southern Haiti, would claim the lives of 2,000 Haitians. August - Taliban Retakes Kabul In Afghanistan - as in Vietnam almost half a century before - the United States had grown tired of a war against an invisible, ideologically-driven enemy fighting on its home territory. Incoming President Joe Biden sped up the withdrawal of US forces, while still claiming the government of President Ashraf Ghani, 72, was motivated and well-armed enough to stave off the threat of the Taliban*. In January 2021, there were 2,500 US troops in Afghanistan but that number had declined significantly by the time the Taliban began their final offensive in May. By July, the Taliban had taken the cities of Kandahar and Herat and morale in the US-backed Afghan National Army had collapsed. The Taliban made dramatic progress in early August but British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab went on holiday to a five-star resort on the Greek island of Crete, apparently oblivious to the hundreds of British citizens trying to get out of Kabul. After the Taliban captured Kabul on 15 August and then took the international airport, Raab came under intense pressure because of the Foreign Office’s tardy response and he was eventually reshuffled by Boris Johnson, being demoted to Justice Secretary. On 26 August, a suicide bomber killed 95 people, including 13 US military personnel, after detonating a device at the Abbey Gate entrance to the airport. Four days later the last US soldier, Captain Chris Donahue, left Afghanistan for good. September - AUKUS Alliance Targets China In September 2021, US President Joe Biden, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Australia’s Scott Morrison announce the formation of a new pact, AUKUS, specifically aimed at countering Chinese influence in the Pacific. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said AUKUS ""seriously undermines regional peace and stability and intensifies the arms race"". But the Chinese were not the only ones who were infuriated by the pact. AUKUS will involved the Americans sharing their knowhow on building and operating nuclear submarines with the Australians and after signing it, Mr. Morrison said he would be pulling out of a deal his predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull, had made in 2016 for the French to build 12 submarines for the Australian Navy. The torpedoing of the deal, which was worth 31 billion euros to the French, was greeted angrily by President Emmanuel Macron’s government. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian described it as a “stab in the back.” October - Russian Movie Director Films In Space Russian actress Yulia Peresild and movie director Klim Shipenko arrived at the International Space Station (ISS) on 5 October to create the world’s first feature film shot entirely in space. Having completed filming of The Challenge, Peresild and Shipenko touched down on Earth together with Russian cosmonaut Oleg Novitskiy on 17 October. Peresild, 37, who starred in the Oscar-nominated Russian movie The Edge in 2010, plays a cardiac surgeon who has to perform open-heart surgery in zero gravity to save the life of a cosmonaut. The Russians beat a rival project by American star Tom Cruise and director Doug Liman, which would use Elon Musk’s SpaceX rockets. Liman meanwhile had a dig at Amazon owner Jeff Bezos, who took “tourists” including William Shatner - who played Captain Kirk in Star Trek - on an orbit of the Earth on his Blue Origin craft. “I’m a bit snobby about it because Blue Origin is not going very high. Like, it’s space, but it’s not. I really think the moon or beyond is space,” said Liman. December - Auf Wiedersehen Angela After 16 years as the Chancellor of Germany, and the most dominant political figure in the country, Angela Merkel finally left office on 7 December. Merkel, a former scientist who grew up in communist East Germany, was a protégé of Helmut Kohl, who was himself in power for 16 years. She led the Christian Democratic Union to four election victories before handing over her position to Armin Laschet, who narrowly lost at the polls on 26 September 2021. After a great deal of horse-trading, the SPD leader Olaf Scholz was finally named Chancellor in December at the head of a coalition which includes the Greens and the liberal Free Democrats. The CDU will be in opposition for the first time since 2005 and the world waits to see if Scholz, a former mayor of Hamburg, will steer Germany in a different direction. December - Putin Chats With Biden Over Ukraine Tensions between Russia and the Ukraine have been growing again, with Kiev refusing to accept the reunification of Crimea with the rest of Russia. The Ukrainians and their friends in Western intelligence agencies have been claiming President Vladimir Putin is preparing his troops to invade Ukraine in early 2022. The US has threatened to send troops to eastern Europe if that happens. On 7 December, Joe Biden and President Putin talked by secure video call - months after they had their first, highly-anticipated summit in person in Geneva, Switzerland. The White House said: “President Biden reiterated his support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and called for de-escalation and a return to diplomacy.” In response, Putin said NATO was making dangerous attempts to expand eastward and was building up its military potential at Russian borders. Putin said he wanted “reliable, legally fixed guarantees” that NATO would not expand to the east and would not deploy offensive weapons in countries bordering Russia.  But Mostly It’s Been COVID But 2021 was, like 2020 before it, dominated once again by the dreaded coronavirus, which has killed 5,388,000 people globally. COVID-19 worries continued to prevail over political and economic discourse around the world. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus which causes COVID-19 is actually called SARS-CoV-2. The original form of the virus emerged in China but various variants have cropped up to keep the scientists on their toes. Alpha (spotted first in Britain) and Beta (which originated in South Africa) were first designated in December 2020 and, in January 2021, Gamma popped up in Brazil. The Delta variant, which emerged in India, caused havoc for much of 2021 but at the end of the year it was Omicron, which was spreading like crazy and forcing countries like the Netherlands to go back into full lockdown. *The Taliban is an organisation under UN sanctions for terrorist activities.",russian,1,2889,95.68,58.2,37.32,8.34,25.57,27,78.23,54.93,44.2,4.6,2.91,0.07,0.42,0.07,1.11,0.55,1.7,12.67,9.55,3.81,15.71,5.43,2.49,6.16,0.48,10.73,5.12,3.08,7.82,1.94,0.76,5.23,6.85,0.35,6.47,0.87,1.32,0.55,0.87,0.31,2.42,0,3.88,1.21,2.49,0.59,0.07,0.45,0.1,0.21,0,0.1,9.45,3.84,0.38,0.14,1.28,0.48,1.25,5.64,0.14,0.07,0.38,1.04,5.5,3.95,1.25,0.31,3.7,0.76,0.28,1.97,0.52,0.24,1.49,0.8,0.42,0,0.03,0,0,0.03,0.35,0.21,0.14,0.59,0.03,0.1,0.03,0.21,0.52,0.17,3.05,10.31,0.17,1.38,8.2,0.59,0.03,0.1,5.05,6.96,1.32,0.83,0.07,0.07,0,0,0,15.61,4.15,6.09,0.07,0.03,0.93,4.33
680,tass.com,2021-12-08 08:00:00,https://tass.com/society/1372631,Soviet Union ceased to exist 30 years ago today,English,,"MOSCOW, December 8. /TASS/. Thirty years ago today, on December 8, 1991 Russia’s President Boris Yeltsin, Ukraine’s President Leonid Kravchuk and Belarusian Parliamentary Speaker Stanislav Shushkevich put their signatures to an agreement on establishing a Commonwealth of Independent States, the CIS. The agreement stated that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist as ""a subject of international law and a geopolitical reality."" The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was founded in 1922 by the leaders of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) as the basis of a future world revolution. In order to attract into the USSR as many socialist republics as possible the first (and all subsequent) Soviet constitutions proclaimed their right to free secession from the Soviet Union. Starting from 1956 the Soviet Union consisted of fifteen union republics. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) was the political force that cemented the Soviet state system. It had a strict hierarchy and in fact was a governing structure parallel to all of the Soviet Union’s executive bodies of power. In the Soviet Constitution the Communist Party was described as ""the leading and guiding force of Soviet society and the backbone of its political system and governmental and non-governmental organizations."" By the 1980s, the Soviet Union had entered a systemic crisis. A large share of the population became disillusioned with the dogmas of the officially professed Communist ideology. The Soviet Union was lagging behind the Western countries economically and technologically. As a result of the Soviet nationalities policy independent national elites took shape in both union and autonomous republics. Attempts at reforming the political system during the years of perestroika in 1985-1991 merely exacerbated the existing contradictions. In 1988-1990 the role of the Communist Party was considerably eased at the initiative of its leader, General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee Mikhail Gorbachev. At the same time, inter-republican relations underwent no revision, which amid the waning influence of the Communist Party sparked an upsurge of separatism in the union republics. The perestroika years in the Soviet Union saw soaring nationalist sentiment. Anti-Armenian pogroms in Azerbaijan’s city of Sumgait in 1988 were the first case of ethnic violence since the launch of perestroika policies. The Sumgait events aggravated the situation in the whole of Transcaucasia. The Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region with its mostly Armenian population declared secession from the Azerbaijani Soviet Socialist Republic, which resulted in a prolonged Armenian-Azerbaijani armed conflict. In 1989, unrest followed in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Moldova, South Ossetia and other regions. By the middle of 1990 inter-ethnic tensions turned more than 600,000 Soviet citizens into refugees or forced migrants. In the Baltic republics, the movement for independence began in 1988. In November 1988, the Supreme Soviet of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic adopted a declaration of state sovereignty. In 1989, similar acts were passed by the Lithuanian and Latvian soviet socialist republics. In the spring of 1990 Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia enacted laws on the restoration of independent statehood. Among other republics, the first one to proclaim state sovereignty was Azerbaijan (September 23, 1989). During 1990 all other union republics passed similar legal acts. The declaration proclaiming the RSFSR’s state sovereignty was adopted at the first congress of people’s deputies on June 12, 1990. In the second half of 1990, the RSFSR leadership under Supreme Soviet Speaker Boris Yeltsin considerably expanded the powers of the Russian government and its ministries and agencies. At the last, 28th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on July 2-13, 1990 the Soviet Union’s first president, Mikhail Gorbachev stated that a new Union Treaty should be signed. On December 3, 1990 the USSR Supreme Soviet supported Gorbachev’s draft, which proposed a new concept of the Union: each constituent republic was to be granted the status of a sovereign country. The Union’s bodies of power were to retain a very limited range of powers, such as those concerning national defense and state security, foreign policy and economic development strategies. At the 4th Congress of the USSR People’s Deputies (the supreme body of power at that moment) on December 17, 1990 Mikhail Gorbachev suggested holding a referendum to let each citizen vote for or against the Union of Sovereign States on a federative basis."" In the March 17, 1991 referendum the voters were asked to answer the question: ""Do you believe it is necessary to preserve the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as a renewed federation of equal and sovereign republics where the rights and freedoms of the individual of any nationality will be guaranteed to the full extent?"" Of the 15 union republics nine participated in the voting: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. Armenia, Georgia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova and Estonia refused. On the whole, 80% of Soviet citizens eligible to vote went to the polling stations in the referendum and 76.4% of them said they wished to preserve the Union, while 21.7% opposed the idea. Alongside the all-union referendum the RSFSR put to the vote the question of establishing the post of the republic’s president (69.85% voted for it). On June 12, 1991 Boris Yeltsin was elected the RSFSR’s president. In the wake of the referendum a new draft of the Union Treaty was developed. On its basis Mikhail Gorbachev and the leaders of nine republics - the RSFSR and the Ukrainian, Kazakh, Uzbek, Azerbaijani, Tajik, Kyrgyz and Turkmen Soviet socialist republics conducted negotiations at the presidential residence Novo-Ogaryovo from April 23 to July 23, 1991 on creating a Union of Sovereign States. Under the treaty's draft the acronym USSR was to be preserved to stand for the Union of Soviet Sovereign Republics. In July 1991, the negotiators approved the draft treaty on the whole. On August 2, Gorbachev appeared on television to declare that a new union treaty would be signed by the RSFSR, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, while the other republics would do so ""at certain intervals."" The text of the treaty was made public for nation-wide discussion on August 15, 1991. A government coup attempt upset the signing of the Union Treaty. On August 18 and 19 a group of senior Communist Party and government officials under Vice-President Gennady Yanayev formed a so-called State Committee for the State of Emergency. With the aim of preventing the signing of the treaty, which, they argued, would have resulted in the collapse of the Soviet Union, the committee’s members ousted Gorbachev from power and declared a state of emergency. RSFSR President Boris Yeltsin refused to obey and slammed the plotters’ actions as an ""anti-constitutional coup."" The plotters’ passiveness, firm resistance from the Russian authorities and a number of union republics and mass protests resulted in the coup’s failure. The August events provoked the potential signatories to the Novo-Ogaryovo treaty to rescind their commitments. On August 24, the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet voted for an independence act, saying that ""creation of an independent Ukrainian state"" was caused by what it described as a ""deadly threat to Ukraine in connection with the government coup in the Soviet Union."" Azerbaijan proclaimed independence on August 30, and Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, on the 31st. All other republics followed suit by the end of the year, Kazakhstan being the last one. Its Supreme Soviet voted for a state independence act on December 16, 1991. On August 23, Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree to suspend the RSFSR Communist Party due to its support for the coup. On August 24, Mikhail Gorbachev made a statement to urge the party’s Central Committee to ""make a difficult but honest decision in favor of self-dissolution."" Gorbachev declared that he was stepping down as the party’s General Secretary. On August 29, the USSR Supreme Soviet suspended the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the whole territory of the country and instructed the prosecutor’s office to probe into the role of the party’s leadership bodies in the government coup attempt. On November 14, the Soviet Union’s President Mikhail Gorbachev and the leaders of the RSFSR, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan made a decision to meet on December 9 for concluding a new treaty on the establishment of a Union of Sovereign States in the form of a ""confederation of democratic states"" with its capital in Minsk. However, by the beginning of December most union republics had already proclaimed independence. Ukraine and Azerbaijan opposed the idea of a confederation. On December 8, 1991 the leaders of the RSFSR, Ukraine and Belarus: Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich met at the Viskuli countryside retreat (the Belovezhskaya Pushcha National Park in Belarus) to sign an agreement to establish a Commonwealth of Independent States. The preamble said that the Soviet Union as a subject of international law and a geopolitical reality had ceased to exist. On December 10, the Supreme Soviets of Ukraine and Belarus denounced the Treaty on the Establishment of the USSR, approved by the 1st congress of the USSR Soviets on December 30, 1922. On December 12, the RSFSR Supreme Soviet ratified the agreement to establish the CIS and denounced the Treaty on the Establishment of the USSR. The leaders of eleven former union republics gathered in Almaty (Kazakhstan) on December 21 to put their signatures to a declaration on the CIS goals and principles and confirm the Belovezh agreements and the termination of the USSR’s existence. The process of creating the CIS was completed. In 1993, a 12th member, Georgia, joined the CIS (its walkout followed in 2009). On December 17, the building of the USSR Supreme Soviet was taken over by the RSFSR Supreme Soviet. The activity of the USSR Foreign Ministry was terminated on December 19. The State Bank was abolished in its previous capacity on December 20. At a meeting between Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin it was agreed to end the activity of the USSR Inter-State Economic Committee and other Union structures starting from December 30. On December 25, the RSFSR Supreme Soviet voted to rename the country to Russian Federation. On the same day, Mikhail Gorbachev appeared on television live to say he was ending his activity as the Soviet Union’s president. After that the Soviet state flag was removed from the flag post over the Kremlin and the state flag of the Russian Federation hoisted instead. On December 26, the Soviet of Republics (one of the two chambers) of the USSR Supreme Soviet adopted a declaration saying that in the wake of the creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States the USSR ceased to exist as a state and a subject of international law. The Russian Federation’s Constitution was adopted on December 12, 1993 in a nation-wide vote.",russian,1,1768,99,44.07,11.63,27.74,22.1,31.62,80.71,49.83,42.48,2.38,0.62,0,0,0.06,0.17,0.4,1.75,18.21,14.71,5.32,17.08,2.66,0.51,4.19,0.06,5.66,4.75,2.32,10.07,3.05,0.62,6.17,4.98,0.28,4.64,0.57,1.19,0.28,0.45,0.11,1.98,0,2.55,1.53,0.96,0.28,0,0.23,0,0.11,0.11,0,7.07,4.02,0.23,0,0.51,0.06,2.04,2.66,0,0,0,0.17,10.97,7.18,3.62,0.17,2.77,0.79,0.06,1.75,0.23,0,0.51,0.06,0,0.06,0,0,0,0,0.06,0.23,0.06,0.17,0,0.11,0.06,0.06,0.23,0.23,0.79,5.43,0,0.62,4.58,0.17,0,0.06,4.24,4.19,0.11,0.23,0,0,0,0,0,15.27,4.64,5.26,0.06,0,1.41,3.9

The people of Crimea and Belarus maintain active ties without using official channels for the work that currently involves people-to-people diplomacy, business cooperation, and the tourism industry, the Russian region’s head Sergey Aksyonov said in an interview with Andrey Vandenko in a TASS special project Top Officials on Monday. ""There are no [official contacts so far]. It is just about people-to-people diplomacy. Members of Crimea’s Belarusian community are engaged in active interaction, they maintain ties, visiting their fellow countrymen. As for entrepreneurs, their business activities are free of politics, so to say,"" Aksyonov pointed out. He noted that for instance, a Belarusian health center continued to operate in Crimea, the tourist inflow had been low but stable since 2014. Belarusian representatives used to attend the Yalta International Economic Forum before the coronavirus pandemic. When asked if Crimea was looking forward to a visit by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko who had told his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in November that he would like to make a trip to the peninsula, Aksyonov said: ""It is up to Vladimir Vladimirovich [Putin] to decide. He invited the Belarusian president and our leader always has my full support. We will certainly be happy to welcome Alexander Grigoryevich [Lukashenko]. They are our Slavic brothers so why should we remain apart?"" Crimea’s head added. Following the 2014 referendum on the reunification of Crimea and Sevastopol with Russia, Ukraine and Western nations introduced a number of sanctions against Russia, which particularly target Russian businessmen and politicians, as well as foreign guests and company employees who visit Crimea. The countries maintain a ban on any positive information about the situation on the peninsula and seek to prevent the region from taking part in international activities abroad. However, numerous foreign delegations visit the peninsula to participate in various forums, congresses, scientific conferences and sporting events, they work together with researchers from Crimea and Sevastopol, establish and cultivate businesses and maintain social connections.",russian,1,326,85.76,80.42,13.19,63.72,19.18,37.42,80.67,55.52,42.33,6.75,4.91,0.31,1.23,0,1.23,1.53,1.84,10.43,7.06,0.92,14.72,4.6,5.21,7.36,0.31,10.74,6.75,2.15,7.67,3.99,0.31,3.37,8.28,0.61,7.67,0.61,1.84,0.92,0.61,0.31,2.76,0,3.37,3.07,0.31,0.92,0.92,0,0,0,0,0,16.26,5.52,1.53,0.31,0,0,2.45,9.51,0.31,0.31,0,1.53,6.44,3.68,2.76,0,7.36,0.31,0,6.75,1.53,0,1.53,0.92,0.61,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.31,0,0.31,0,0,0.31,0,3.07,8.28,0.92,0,7.06,0.31,0,0,3.37,3.07,2.45,0.31,0,0,0,0,0,17.48,4.91,6.13,0.31,0,0.92,5.21

According to Dr.Marco Marsili, who is a research fellow at the Institute for Political Studies at the Catholic University of Portugal and an associate fellow at the Centre for Strategic Research and Analysis, one of the biggest problems for the OSCE is its inability to go from broad declarations to concrete, legally binding decisions. Sputnik: What are the key challenges that the OSCE is facing right now, what are the organisation’s main goals and what are the regions where it is most active? Marco Marsili: In my opinion, the OSCE has to go further with the current capabilities that the organisation has. There are many challenges that so far the OSCE was not able to fix. Since the OSCE Troika was established in 1992 - this format that comprises the chairman office, and the previous and the incoming chairman office, was established by the Helsinki Summit, - this format, which should be useful for solving or fixing the major international disputes, territorial disputes and conflicts within the OSCE area, has proven to be unsuccessful. I’m talking about the “5+2” talks established in 2007 to solve the Transnistrian issue and the Geneva international discussions established in 2008, which are co-chaired by the UN, the EU and Russia, to try to fix the Georgian war and the question of the breakaway republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and finally, the Trilateral Group on Ukraine, established in 2014, that has the purpose to settle the conflict in Donbass. I think that, so far, the effort of the OSCE to solve these questions - the main issues - and to fix the political and diplomatic mess in the Balkan area and in the former Soviet republics, has proven to be unsuccessful and the organisation was not able to overcome these stalemates. Sputnik: Some observers say that it’s been a “bumpy ride” for Sweden at the helm of the OSCE in 2021 and that there is some degree of paralysis in the decision-making process within the organisation. Would you agree with such statements? Were there any breakthroughs during Sweden’s chairmanship? Marco Marsili: It’s common that summits end up with a consensus declaration. What is difficult is that when you give up reaching a majority decision, and you give up to this principle, you bind yourself by the principle of a shared common statement. This way, of course, you open up for declarations that are so broad, that they do not provide any specific means to address questions, to fix problems. These declarations are so broad, mainly because they are declarations of principles, but they do not contain any legal instruments. So far, these summits have proven to be unsuccessful at the end of the day and they do not provide you with legal means, that someone has to put in force. So, in the end, these summits are a big waste of time - a big effort for nothing. Sputnik: Poland will lead the OSCE next year. Do you think Warsaw will use this stage to push forward its vision of the situation at the border with Belarus? Marco Marsili: My opinion is that it will be “business as usual”. This is being called “hybrid warfare” in the wrong way by the media. It hasn’t been termed as an act of “warfare” or “war” by any diplomats or senior figures, or by any government. State officials and representatives of major international organisations refer to this situation at the border between Belarus and Poland as a “hybrid attack” or a “hybrid operation”, and so on. But nobody referred officially to this situation as “hybrid warfare” – that’s something different because “warfare” ceased to exist after the Second World War, and became illegal under the UN Charter, and it should be referred to as an “armed conflict”, that is the official definition according to the Geneva Conventions. So, as there are no armed troops, no military at the border, there is no war or warfare. It's “business as usual”. And hybrid operations is simply the employment of different tools, tactics, techniques that include diplomatic and economic sanctions, propaganda and information operations, et cetera. There's nothing to be worried about. In my opinion, nobody is “masterminding” anything. The Russian Federation, like it happened with cyber-attacks in the past, has been accused of being behind the situation at the border between Belarus and Poland. But it’s “allegedly accused”. Like with the cyber-attacks against multiple countries such as the Baltic states or the United States - nobody was able so far to prove it. And so, these are all just allegations. And I just think that the situation just warmed up and things simply happened. There isn't any mastermind behind it. There isn't any plan to destabilise Poland, either by the Russian Federation or by Belarus.",russian,1,824,77.87,27.47,49.73,3.05,22.89,25.24,83.86,65.17,54.98,9.34,2.31,0.73,0,0.97,0,0.49,7.04,16.99,9.95,1.21,15.66,8.74,3.88,8.13,1.94,12.62,6.67,1.7,7.77,0.61,3.28,4,12.62,1.09,11.53,3.4,0.85,0.49,2.67,0.97,3.16,0,3.64,0.61,3.03,0.12,0,0.12,0.12,0,0,0,6.31,3.64,0,0.24,0.85,0.49,1.46,2.55,0,0,0,0,2.43,1.7,0.49,0.24,2.67,0,0,2.43,0.36,0.12,0.12,0.12,0.12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.61,0,0,0,0,0,0.12,0.36,0.24,2.18,8.86,0,0.85,8.25,0.12,0,0.12,2.18,2.43,5.7,0.97,0.12,0,0.12,0,0,18.08,4,6.19,0.49,0,1.58,5.83

Banks",English,Russia,"US President Joe Biden said on Tuesday that he was imposing the first tranche of economic sanctions against the Russian Federation in response to Moscow's recognition of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics and deployment of peacekeeping forces to the Donbass. “Russia just announced that it is carving out a big chunk of Ukraine,” Biden said on Tuesday, saying Russian President Vladimir Putin was “setting up a rationale to take more territory by force.” “This is the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, as he asked permission for in his Duma,” he continued. “Who in the Lord’s name does Putin think gives him the right to declare new so-called countries on territory that belonged to his neighbors?” Biden asked. “This is a flagrant violation of international law and it demands a firm response from the international community.” The US president announced the first tranche of sanctions against Russia, which target VEB Development Bank, Promsvyazbank Public Joint Stock Company (PSB), and 42 of their subsidiaries; Russia's sovereign debt; and imposes sanctions on Russian ""elites and their families."" He also said he had worked with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to ensure that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which would have brought liquefied natural gas from Russia to German, will not open. ""We are implementing comprehensive sanctions on Russian sovereign debt. That means we have cut off Russia's government from Western financing. It can no longer raise money from the West and cannot trade in its new debt on our markets or European markets either,"" Biden said. “Today’s actions, taken in coordination with our partners and allies, begin the process of dismantling the Kremlin’s financial network and its ability to fund destabilizing activity in Ukraine and around the world,” US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in an Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) news release announcing the details of the new sanctions. “We continue to monitor Russia’s actions and if it further invades Ukraine, the United States will swiftly impose expansive economic sanctions that will have a severe and lasting impact on Russia’s economy,"" she added. The sanctions are slated to take effect beginning on Wednesday. Biden said the US was prepared to implement sanctions ""far beyond” those in 2014 if Russia attacks Ukraine. He also revealed that US troops would be shifted from elsewhere in Europe into the Baltic States in response to Russian troops remaining in Belarus. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are all members of the NATO alliance. Citing a US official, Reuters reported that this included 800 troops from Italy, 20 Apache attack helicopters presently stationed in Germany, and 12 Apache helicopters being sent to Poland from Greece. ""When all is said and done, we're going to judge Russia by its actions, not its words. Whatever Russia does next, we're ready to respond with unity, clarity and conviction,"" Biden said. ""I'm hoping diplomacy is still available."" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters afterward that Putin did not watch Biden's speech, as he was in a working meeting at the time. On Monday, Putin announced he was moving to recognize the independence of the Lugansk People's Republic and the Donetsk People's Republic, two breakaway states in the Donbass region that declared independence from Ukraine in 2014, following the US-backed coup in Kiev. He explained on Tuesday that the Minsk Protocol, which was supposed to lead to peace in the Donbass conflict, had long been killed by Kiev, which refused to implement the deal reached with Russia and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). The decision came as Ukrainian forces dramatically escalated their attacks on the Donbass republics last week, sending tens of thousands of civilians fleeing to safety in Russia's Rostov region. However, the US claimed the attacks were fake and part of a provocation planned by Moscow to justify intervention in Ukraine. The attacks came in the larger context of NATO claiming that Russian troops drilling near the Ukrainian border were preparing an invasion of Ukraine. Moscow has denied any intent to invade, but said that the situation would be considerably less tense if NATO took certain actions to respect Russia's security concerns, including halting its eastward expansion, writing off letting Ukraine join the alliance, and promising not to station offensive weapons near Russia's borders.

",English,Russia,"London remains one of the primary sources of all sorts of claims regarding the purported ""Russian invasion"" of Ukraine. Among the most recent ones are allegations that Moscow seeks to install a pro-Russian government in the neighbouring country. On Sunday, a new round of threats of sanctions against Russia came from UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss. Particularly, she warned that the government would consider legislation that would allow it to ""hit a much wider variety of targets"" with sanctions, mentioning ""Putin's oligarchs"" and ""Russian companies involved in propping up the Russian state"". The pretext for the bravado is unlikely to surprise anyone: it is once again Russian plans to ""invade"" Ukraine - the same plans that Moscow has been denying for several weeks. Given that both Russia and the West seem to agree on pursuing a diplomatic solution for the situation around Ukraine, the move by the United Kingdom to heat up the tensions with threats raises eyebrows. ""London for some unknown reason is trying to play Washington’s ingratiating puppet (despite the Biden regime attack British policy in Ireland and crippling our steel industry!)"" says Rodney Atkinson, a British academic as well as a political and economic commentator. ""London has gone along with all the repeated attacks on Russia and NATO’s move eastwards and is arming and training Ukraine - the most blatantly Nazi country in Europe where parades of openly fascistic symbols and the honouring of the Nazi Stepan Bandera are regarded as normal behaviour"". According to the academic, this is nothing short of being ""part of a two decade long European corporatist fascist attack on Eastern Europe and Russia"". The ""American attack"" targeting Moscow, in his view, stems from the ""abysmal ignorance of Europe, the non communist political economy of modern Russia and engrained Hollywood Russophobia"". However, there is also another reason for London to take such an aggressive stance against Russia, with Moscow being labelled as an external enemy needed by UK PM Boris Johnson to draw attention away from internal crises - particularly from the infamous ""Partygate"" scandal. ""The weakest partner feels they need to shout the loudest. Britain was forced to follow the USA’s fatal policy of abandoning Afghanistan and now feels forced to bang the drum for aggression in eastern Europe"", Atkinson explains. There is a country, however, that seems to have taken ""the most sober and rational approach"", notes Atkinson, and it is Germany - it warns of the possible dangers a war could pose, also pointing at the reasons behind Russia's security concerns and the economic costs of the conflict. ""Although the economic attack on Russia is a part of the military attack the principal motivation is ideological, based on the failure to understand modern Russia and the potential for peaceful co-existence"", Atkinson says. ""Germany understands that an economically weak Russia would be militarily destabilising and a disaster for Germany and European business and has rightly refused to send arms to Ukraine"". Aside from Germany, the academic continues, several other countries also do not appear to be eager to stand with Ukraine, among them Belarus, Poland, Hungary, and Croatia - the latter has already said it would withdraw its troops from NATO should the alliance engage in conflict. Looking back, Atkinson referred to some history lessons - particularly those from Croatia and the anti-Serb Ustaša movement. ""When I once warned Margaret Thatcher about the fascist nature and history of the President of Croatia she was shocked and speechless"", he said.

Kiev has announced its intention to convene a meeting of the 57 member signatories of the Vienna Document, including Russia, to discuss Moscow's alleged failure to respond to Kiev's request for information on its military activities, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has announced. ""Russia failed to respond to our request under the Vienna Document. Consequently, we take the next step.

Kiev's request included demands that Russia provide data on areas where its troops are operating, the dates when they will be withdrawn (if applicable), as well as unit names, the formations they are subordinated to, types of weapons and military equipment involved, and other details. Kuleba warned Friday that if Russia failed to provide this data, or provided information which was deemed insufficient or inadequate by Kiev, Ukraine would convene the emergency Vienna Document meeting to demand an explanation. Parties to the Vienna Document typically exchange information on military forces, major weapons systems and other equipment, as well as defence planning and military budget information on an annual basis. The treaty provides for consultations in the event of ""unusual military activities"" or dangerous incidents. Request Unreasonable, Russia Says Shortly after Kiev made its request Friday, a Russian Foreign Ministry source told Sputnik that the demands were unreasonable, ""since Russian military activity is not unusual and does not give grounds to launch the military danger reduction mechanism provided"" by the Vienna Document. The source said Moscow considers Kiev's request a ""maneuver"" aimed at distracting from ""its own significant unusual military activities,"" as well as daily shelling of the breakaway Donbass republics. The Russian side would provide a response to the Ukrainian request soon, the source assured. The call for the Vienna Document meeting comes amid claims by Western  media Friday citing unnamed political and military officials that Russian President Vladimir Putin had made a decision to invade Ukraine, and would be doing so as soon as this week. Moscow has dismissed the claims, accusing Washington of colluding with media to drum up war ""hysteria,"" and denying having any plans to attack anyone. On Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asked media to provide proof of Russia's supposed invasion plans, and on Sunday US officials including Biden National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Pentagon spokesman John Kirby walked back claims about a specific invasion date, while maintaining that an attack may occur ""any day now."" Provocation Danger Amid Western allegations about Russia's plans, Moscow has expressed its own concerns of a possible provocation against the breakaway Donbass region by Kiev or its allies, particularly amid confirmation by the OSCE mission in Ukraine that some member states are withdrawing observers from the conflict zone, citing fears for their personal safety. Moscow has repeatedly called on Kiev to implement the Minsk Agreements aimed at ending the long-running civil war in eastern Ukraine. The Minsk deal, signed in the Belarusian capital in February 2015, called on the Ukrainian military and the Donbass militias to reach a ceasefire, and withdraw troops and heavy military equipment from the line of contact. It also stipulated for elections to be held in the breakaway regions, and for Kiev to grant them broad autonomy in exchange for a return to Ukrainian jurisdiction. The Ukrainian government has refused to implement the second part of the deal, with flirting in this direction by President Volodymyr Zelensky in 2019 ending after a 50,000-strong mob of protesters in Kiev threatened to overthrow his administration. In recent weeks, Donbass militias have expressed growing concerns about a heavy Ukrainian buildup near the conflict zone. On Friday, a spokesman for the People's Militia of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic reported that new Ukrainian troops, S-300 air defence systems, heavy rocket artillery and British and Polish mercenaries had been spotted near the front.",russian,1,838,97.41,55.71,28.78,8.13,32.23,35.08,77.45,49.88,41.53,4.77,1.31,0,0.72,0,0.12,0.48,3.46,13.13,8.83,1.31,17.18,3.7,2.27,5.85,0.24,7.76,4.06,1.79,11.69,2.27,1.55,8,7.52,0.36,7.16,1.31,1.79,0.6,1.91,0.12,1.79,0,3.46,1.07,2.39,0.24,0.12,0.12,0.12,0,0,0,11.81,8.23,0.12,1.19,1.19,0.48,2.74,3.94,0,0,0,0.36,6.32,4.3,1.79,0.24,1.67,0.12,0,1.43,0.12,0,0.48,0.12,0.12,0,0,0,0.12,0.12,0,0.24,0,0.12,0.24,0.12,0,0,1.43,0.36,0.95,9.07,0.6,0.84,7.28,0.36,0,0.48,4.53,2.86,3.1,1.07,0.12,0.12,0,0,0,13.37,3.1,5.13,0,0,1.19,3.94

Ukraine over the past seven years since the signing of the Minsk agreements has turned into an anti-Russian and largely authoritarian state where Donbass should not return by any means, the deputy director of the CIS Countries Institute, Vladimir Zharikhin, told TASS on Friday. ""Donbass cannot return to Ukraine that there exists today, because over the past seven years Ukraine has turned different and Donbass has turned different. The country’s current regime, with its major authoritarian features, prevents this return. The real opposition there is under pressure, just like all oppositional mass media. There are arrests, quite often extrajudicial arrests, of those who are opposed to Kiev’s policy,"" Zharikhin said. In a situation like this the representatives of the Donbass republics will be faced with ""trumped-up charges, like those brought against Viktor Medvedchuk [the leader of the political council of the Opposition Platform-For Life party]."" Zharikhin believes that in the current situation the sole way of settling the situation somehow is to freeze it for the time being and let the Donbass republics restore their economies to normal. ""For this it is necessary to achieve the troop pullout and, possibly, to deploy peacekeepers along the disengagement line,"" he believes. ""If there can be progress towards a settlement, it can be achieved only by these means. Today’s Ukraine is unable to resolve the problem on the basis of the Minsk agreements,"" Zharikhin said. The leader of the Donetsk People’s Republic, Denis Pushilin, told a news briefing on Friday that the people of Donbass would like to see future Ukraine a member of one Union State together with Russia and Belarus.

The Russiagate narrative has collapsed to a degree that was previously unimaginable to the handful of investigative journalists who have worked diligently to expose it as both a hoax and a deep state coup attempt.

Under the amendment, the US president will determine whether the Russian government is engaged in or knowingly supports a significant escalation in hostilities or hostile action in or against Ukraine compared to levels before November 1, 2021. ""Substantial new sanctions should be imposed in the event that the Government of the Russian Federation engages in escalatory military or other offensive operations against Ukraine,"" the amendment reads. The sanctions would target high-level Russian government and military officials, entities and officials tied to Nord Stream 2, Russian banks, and state-owned businesses. The measure would also ban primary and secondary sovereign debt transactions. Moreover, the measure would authorize additional security assistance for Ukraine. The amendment was submitted to be part of the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act, which the US Senate agreed to begin debate on Friday morning.

Russia accused the US and other western countries of artificially magnifying the fears of war and urged them to cease this dangerous rhetoric. US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, has called on the UN Security Council to take seriously the risks allegedly posed all around the world by Russia's aggressive and destabilising behaviour. The envoy further urged the council members to assess Russia's actions and not just statements. The ambassador to the UN claimed that Russia plans, by the middle of February, to boost its military presence in allied Belarus' territory to 30,000. She expressed the hope that Moscow chooses diplomacy over conflict in Ukraine. The Kremlin has repeatedly rejected the US' allegations that it plans to attack Ukraine, and pointed out that NATO itself has been building up troops and offensive weapons in the countries bordering Russia over the past decades. Open Talks on Ukraine The US also invited Russia to take part in a public meeting on the situation concerning Ukraine with Washington insisting this was the way Moscow could discuss its security concerns. The envoy to the US insisted that by accepting the offer, the Kremlin would allegedly show its good faith in the matter. ""The United States has been clear. If this is truly about Russia's security concerns in Europe, we're offering them an opportunity to address these concerns at the negotiating table"", Thomas-Greenfield said. The Russian side rushed the voting on the proposal with Russia and China voting against it, 10 Security Council Members voting in favour and three more abstaining. China's envoy to the UN called on both sides to engage in ""quiet diplomacy"" instead of organising public meetings or engaging in ""public confrontation"". Russia's ambassador to the UN Vassily Nebenzia called the initiative unacceptable interference into Russia's domestic affairs and an attempt to ""mislead the international community"" on what was really happening in the region. Nebenzia further slammed the proposal as a ""classic example of megaphone diplomacy"". The Russian ambassador further pointed out that the US has so far failed to provide any evidence to back up claims of a planned Russian attack on Ukraine. Nebenzia said statements about an alleged possible war were a ""fiction"" and expressed concerns that the US actually wants them to come true. ""Talks about the coming war are provocative by themselves. [The US] seems to be calling for this, wanting and waiting for [war] to happen, as if you want to make your speculations come true"", Nebenzia said. Russia Faces 'Swift and Severe Consequences' If It Walks Out on Diplomacy On the same day, US President Joe Biden commented on the proposal to set up a meeting on Ukraine claiming that Washington was allowing Russia to ""engage in good faith"" if it was ""sincere"" when it said it wanted to tackle its security concerns through diplomacy. The president said that otherwise, Russia faced the threat of severe consequences. ""If instead Russia chooses to walk away from diplomacy and attack Ukraine, Russia will bear the responsibility, and it will face swift and severe consequences"", Biden said. In a written statement published by the White House, Biden claimed that the US has ""presented in detail"" the alleged nature of Russia’s ""threat to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity"" without going into detail. POTUS further noted that the US and its allies are continuing to prepare for every possible outcome regarding Ukraine. ""The world must be clear-eyed about the actions Russia is threatening and ready to respond to the risks those actions present to all of us,"" Biden said in the statement.

The United States has no right to intervene in constitutional processes in Belarus, while deploying nuclear weapons to Europe, and all of its commentaries regarding rumored risks of a Russian invasion of Ukraine are paranoidal, the chairman of the State Duma’s international affairs committee, Leonid Slutsky, said in his Telegram channel on Wednesday. A senior US Department of State official on Tuesday said at a special briefing that the forthcoming joint exercise by Russia and Belarus would allegedly allow Russia to attack Ukraine from the north. ""The US Department of State’s claims are as ceremonious as far away from reality, let alone paranoidal. It looks like any activity by Russia’s armed forces will be causing an unhealthy reaction from the United States,"" Slutsky said. As for statements concerning the constitutional referendum in Belarus, Slutsky said they were ""another crude attempt at intervention and at exerting pressure on a sovereign state."" ""To make a decision what Constitution Belarus should have is the sole prerogative of the Belarusian people. Without anybody making prompts from outside.

The recent deployment of this term for Kazakh President Kasym-Jomart Tokayev as the US declares its innocence in destructive riots is thus a dark sign of times to come. “There are some crazy Russian claims about the US being behind this,” White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said on Wednesday about the riots in Kazakhstan. “So, let me just use this opportunity to convey that as absolutely false and clearly a part of the standard Russian disinformation playbook we’ve seen a lot of in past years.” After events in Kazakhstan took a decisive turn on Wednesday, so did western media’s orientation toward them. Now, Tokayev has become a “Russian-backed” strongman and the West has found another self-proclaimed opposition leader to drive a wedge into the country’s politics. On January 2, Kazakhstan’s western Mangystau region saw several oil-rich towns near the Caspian Sea erupt in demonstrations over a sharp rise in petroleum prices. However, other demonstrations soon erupted in Almaty, the country’s eastern metropolis and former capital, which became far more violent. Public buildings were stormed, sacked and torched, and rioters attacked police with weapons, including rifles. At least 4,000 rioters have been arrested, while thousands have been injured and an unknown number killed. Hundreds of police officers and national guardsmen have also been injured and at least 18 killed, including two who were beheaded. Tokyaev said Friday that roughly 20,000 gunmen had attacked Almaty and displayed evidence of foreign training. Tokayev declared a state of emergency, said the rioters were terrorists with foreign backing, and invoked the mutual defense clause of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). CSTO members Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan have all answered the call, sending peacekeeping forces to Kazakhstan to protect public buildings but not engage in law enforcement operations. Ablyazov Condemns Russian ‘Occupation’ Then on Friday, Reuters interviewed a former Kazakh trade minister and banker who has been hiding out in Paris from charges that he perpetrated one of the biggest financial frauds in history: Mukhtar Ablyazov. In the interview, he claimed to be leader of the opposition to Tokayev and called on the West to “tear Kazakhstan away from Russia."" ""If not, then Kazakhstan will turn into Belarus and [Russian President Vladimir] Putin will methodically impose his program -  the recreation of a structure like the Soviet Union,"" Ablyazov told Reuters. ""Russia has already entered, sent in troops. CSTO is Russia. This is an occupation by Russia.” ""I see myself as the leader of the opposition,"" Ablyazov also said. ""Every day the protesters call me and ask: 'What should we do? We are standing here: What should we do?'"" ""I know the Soviet cliche of a Western spy, but I would be happy to be an American or European spy because then we would live like the people in America or Europe - and everyone would laugh,"" he said. ""Sadly, the West doesn't help me; the West hinders me."" An article published Friday in the US state-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s (RFERL) Kazakh Service made a telling observation about the protests. One of the demands by protesters from the country’s unregistered Democratic Party (not to be confused with Ablyazov’s party, Democratic Choice), who claim not to be part of the violent “provocateurs” torching public buildings and shooting at police, was “the immediate deployment of foreign peacekeepers” from the CSTO “to bolster security amid the chaos.” Synchronicity With Western Media, Leaders However, much of Ablyazov’s rhetoric has a mirror in that used by Western media and politicians, including the New York Times and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Speaking Friday in Washington, Blinken said “it's not clear why they feel the need for any outside assistance,” referring to Kazakh security forces, who he said “certainly have the capacity to deal appropriately with protests.” “We're trying to learn more about it,” Blinken added. “I think one lesson in recent history is that once Russians are in your house, it's sometimes very difficult to get them to leave."" The same language appeared in a Friday article in the New York Times, as well. An opinion piece by Andrew Higgins, the Times’ Central and Eastern Europe bureau chief, was titled “In Kazakhstan, Putin Again Seizes on Unrest to Try to Expand Influence.” “But a series of revolts against a pro-Russian strongman could also plant the seeds of rebellion at home, analysts say,” the article’s lede adds. “The arrival in Kazakhstan of 2,500 troops from a Russian-led military alliance amid continuing spasms of violent protest was the fourth time in just two years that Moscow has flexed its muscle in neighboring states - Belarus, Armenia and Ukraine being the other three - that the West has long tried to woo,” Higgins wrote. “And once Russian troops arrive, they seldom, if ever, go home. Russian troops sent three decades ago as ‘peacekeepers’ to the breakaway region of Moldova and the Abkhazia region of Georgia are still there.” According to Higgins, Tokayev is one of the “strongman leaders the Kremlin has trusted to keep order,” but before Tokayev requested CSTO peacekeepers on Wednesday, he wasn’t being referred to as Russian-backed. Also on Friday, Jonathan Landay, a Reuters national security reporter in Washington, DC, also referred to Tokayev as “the Russian-backed president.” “Expect to see ‘Russian-backed’ in every reference to Kazakhstan from now on, just as there are no ‘Houthis’ but only ‘Iran-backed Houthis,’” news analyst Steve Patt said in a Friday tweet in response. “Propaganda never sleeps.” Expect to see “Russian-backed” in every reference to Kazakhstan from now on, just as there are no “Houthis” but only “Iran-backed Houthis”. Propaganda never sleeps. pic.twitter.com/wEGbLqiTV5— 🇵🇸Left 👁 on the News (@leftiblog) January 7, 2022 On Thursday, Psaki also questioned the validity of the CSTO deployment, telling reporters that the Biden administration has “questions about the nature of this request and whether it has - it was a legitimate invitation or not.” Other outlets have perpetuated similar misconceptions, including US National Public Radio, which said on Friday that “Russian troops are in Kazakhstan to help quell deadly anti-government protests,” and Axios, which said on Thursday that “Russian paratroopers descended on Kazakhstan's largest city Thursday to help quell the largest uprising in the history of the former Soviet republic.” It is important to note, for the record, that the international peacekeeping force is there under CSTO direction and control, not Russian, and the organization’s rotating chair is presently held by Armenia, not Russia. Also, to reiterate the above, the CSTO peacekeepers are only in Kazakhstan to protect public buildings, not to engage in law enforcement operations. Recycled Regime Change Playbook This type of message coordination between US leaders, corporate media, and opposition politicians in targeted countries has been seen before on several occasions. In Venezuela in 2019, when a no-name opposition figure named Juan Guaido arbitrarily and unilaterally declared himself the country’s interim president, despite having almost no following in the country, he got extensive support from the US and other Western powers - to say nothing of the Western media -  and has been upheld by them as Venezuela’s legitimate leader instead of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Maduro has become a “strongman” kept in power by Russia and Cuba, which have been punished and demonized by the US as a result. It was seen again in Ethiopia in 2021, when the US supported the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) against Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. When Abiy successfully resisted the TPLF offensive and pushed the group back into Tigray from other parts of Ethiopia they had occupied, the New York Times stepped in to portray him as a strongman being kept in power by drones supplied by like-minded authoritarians in Eritrea, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Iran, and China. The former President of Bolivia, Evo Morales, was also labeled a “strongman” in 2019 by the country’s opposition, who accused him of trying to change the results of the election. Morales, too, was portrayed as an “authoritarian” propped up by other strongmen, including Maduro. That this rhetoric has once again surfaced in the context of the riots in Kazakhstan suggests the accusations Psaki cavalierly labeled as “crazy” might not be so crazy after all.",russian,1,1381,89.82,38.8,50.4,14.66,25.11,30.34,81.32,60.1,48.01,5.58,2.97,0.65,0.65,0.07,0.72,0.51,2.61,12.74,8.18,1.81,16.29,6.15,4.85,6.37,1.3,12.02,6.52,3.4,8.04,1.96,0.43,5.65,9.05,0.94,8.11,1.16,1.16,0.72,1.09,0.22,3.62,0,4.06,1.59,2.1,1.01,0.22,0.43,0,0.29,0.07,0,11.01,6.37,0.58,0.14,1.59,0.36,3.19,4.63,0.29,0,0,0.72,5.79,2.9,2.9,0,3.48,0.22,0.36,2.61,0.29,0.14,0.8,0.22,0,0.07,0,0,0,0,0.29,0.14,0,0.22,0,0,0,0.14,0.51,0,3.33,9.78,0.07,1.09,7.75,1.09,0,0.07,5.36,5.43,3.11,0.43,0.29,0.14,0.14,0,0,22.01,3.98,7.02,0.14,0,2.1,8.76

According to the Polish politician, the risk of war is ""now greater than ever before in the last 30 years"". Thomas Greminger, director of the Geneva Centre for Security Policy who previously served as secretary general of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe from 2017 to 2020, has addressed issues in Russia-Europe relations, explaining which options to solve the problems in the region are now on the table. Sputnik: Chairperson-in-Office of the OSCE Zbigniew Rau stated there has been no breakthrough in the Vienna talks. Why is that? What does this tell us about the overall progress of the talks? Thomas Greminger: I think this could not be expected. So, I think what we can see after a week of intense talks starting here in Geneva, continued in Brussels, and today in Vienna at the permanent council of the OSCE, on a positive note, clearly, there is a readiness for dialogue by everybody. And I think that's also what I heard from this morning's statement, all major stakeholders at the permanent council of the OSCE. Second, what we have also seen is that there are areas that are in the short- to medium-term, there is a potential for relatively quick agreements. And I would argue that this is what normally is being described as military risk reduction. Dialogue between militaries, more transparency when it comes to major exercises close to borders, stationing troops, weapons systems close to borders, restraint - all these kinds of issues. And here I would argue Russia has been advocating such a military risk reduction agenda for years and hasn't been really listened to. Now there seems to be a readiness to have a dialogue. I think that's an achievement. Yes, when it comes to the really fundamental issues of European security, when we talk about the guarantees that have been requested by Russia, I think there - I'm not surprised, that we haven't ended up with an outcome after one week of discussions because here we are discussing reconciling two very fundamental principles of European security. You have, on the one side, the right of every country to freely choose its security arrangements, its alliances, et cetera. And you have on the other, the principle of indivisibility of security, meaning that no country should expand its own security at the expense of another country. Now, if you apply these two principles to countries like Ukraine, but also to Belarus, Moldova, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, all these countries that are in between the Russian Federation and NATO you can quickly see that this is very delicate, very challenging. For this, we need lots of dialogue, diplomacy. And at the end, also probably some sort of creativity. But I'm confident that if there is a political will, it is possible to also find a solution for the status of these countries in between taking into account these two principles. Sputnik: The EU foreign policy chief stated that Russia's security proposals are unacceptable for all EU members. Why is the West rejecting the proposals out of hand? Thomas Greminger: Partly this is the usual rhetoric, the usual positioning that you would hear from parties at the beginning of any serious negotiations. The perception in the West is also that the kinds of proposals that came from Moscow that they are maximalist. Their verdict was very harsh. So, I think perceptions are quite similar regarding the maximalist positioning of the other side at the outset, so we shouldn't be too surprised about that. For me, what is more important is that there is this readiness now to engage seriously in a constructive discussion on all of these issues, solving the problem in the Donbass and agreeing, hopefully quickly, to measures of military risk reduction, strengthen confidence, and security-building measures and addressing these very fundamental issues of European security - trying to reconcile these principles of European security. Sputnik: The Russian foreign minister says the prospects for further security talks depend on how Washington and Brussels respond to Moscow's proposals. Russia will be forced to take action if it does not obtain a constructive response to its security proposals within a reasonable time. Do you believe the West will give credible answers? What is the West ready to guarantee then? Thomas Greminger: There is no abstract answer to this question right now. I think this is why one needs to sit at the table and that's why one needs to negotiate. And I think what is important is that there is now quickly an understanding, also on the process, what is going to be discussed and eventually, negotiate that in which format. And but then I would also, you know, call for certain strategic patience. I think serious matters will require time and also at the end a number of issues they can obviously be discussed between Moscow and Washington directly. But then for other issues, you will indeed have to consult the more inclusive platforms be it a NATO-Russia Council or be it the OSCE. And in that sense, for me, that has witnessed and now almost a decade of little appetite for dialogue to hear now between a big, relatively strong commitment to dialogue by major stakeholders of European security. This as such is positive. Sputnik: With regard to the Minsk agreements – aimed at resolving the crisis in Ukraine, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko stated yesterday that the need to fulfil the Minsk agreements had disappeared from NATO's vocabulary. Russia has repeatedly stated the need to implement them, although it is still being portrayed as the aggressor in the situation. What's behind this? Thomas Greminger: First of all, I would totally agree with Deputy Minister Grushko that indeed, there is no alternative to implementing the Minsk agreements. That's what we have. And that should be implemented. And I think we should just stop the blame game and again, try to get into a more positive dynamic. We had it for a few months, as you know, from mid-2019 on and now we're totally stuck and it is indeed very important to get towards implementing the Minsk agreements. There is no doubt about it. Sputnik: Why are the US and its European allies focusing on Ukraine and disarmament, whereas Russian demands concern a much broader picture of European security? Thomas Greminger: I think it depends a bit again on which agendas you focus on. After the summit between Presidents Biden and Putin in Geneva, we have seen a strategic stability dialogue develop an agenda that focuses very much on the global, on what they call strategic items, nuclear mid-range, long-range non-proliferation space, hypersonic weapon systems. And now I think that there seems to be an evolving agreement that there is a need for a parallel track that would focus, on the one hand, on these very principled issues of European security that we have discussed before, but would also give an opportunity to discuss more immediate measures of military risk reductions. And I think this is good and serves an agenda that the Russian Federation has been pushing for a number of years now and not very successfully because there seemed not to have been a lot of interest. Sputnik: Why is NATO increasing military assistance to Ukraine when Stoltenberg himself claimed the alliance is aiming to spread democracy? How does this correlate with the need to protect European security? Thomas Greminger: I'm not going to now defend any NATO policies. I think that's not my job. But what I've been hearing is that this military assistance so far has mainly been geared to helping Ukraine to better defend itself and that there is apparently no offensive scope to it. But again, I think we all have an interest to solve the conflict in the Donbass. But my understanding is also that we need now to think to calm things down and to de-escalate it because at the end you cannot negotiate constructively at gunpoint, so I think de-escalation is important. Sputnik: Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov in Thursday's interview said that he would neither confirm nor exclude a Russian military deployment to Cuba and Venezuela if tensions with the United States mount. What needs to be done now to avoid further deadlock and not allow the situation to deteriorate? Thomas Greminger: We certainly wouldn't need additional military or political posturing. Again, adding fuel to the current tensions will not create this enabling environment. What we now need is an understanding as quickly as possible on a clear agenda, on a clear way forward to discuss these different issues. We also have to acknowledge that these different issues, they're all linked in a way or another. And if not least, if we advance on one issue, we build trust, which again, would help to advance on another issue. So, I think it's important to both advance regarding implementing the Minsk agreements, and these military risk reduction measures that we have been discussing at the structured dialogue in the OSCE for years, since 2017 without any tangible results. I think if there is now a political commitment to move ahead on such measures, this as such would be valid. But I understand, of course, the Russian interest that also these more fundamental issues are properly addressed and discussed. And again, from what I've been hearing this week, there is an interest to do so. But it will be difficult - it will be difficult for all sides because you have these very fundamental principles that to an extent represent a dilemma.",russian,1,1616,52.93,31.74,46.49,22.55,21.84,26.79,85.52,70.24,57.98,12.25,4.7,2.04,1.36,0.74,0.12,0.37,7.55,16.15,7.61,0.87,14.17,9.22,7.55,6.93,1.42,15.47,5.88,3.59,5.75,2.17,1.36,2.35,14.42,1.36,13.06,3.28,1.49,2.17,1.92,1.18,3.65,0,2.29,1.18,0.99,0.68,0.31,0.25,0,0.25,0,0,9.1,5.32,0.68,0.31,0.43,0.25,2.85,3.53,0,0,0,0.12,3.22,2.17,0.99,0.06,1.11,0.12,0,0.93,0.12,0,0.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06,0,1.05,0.06,0.31,0,0,0,0.12,1.67,0.31,4.83,7.61,0.37,0.37,5.82,0.43,0.37,0.19,4.76,2.54,6.81,1.79,0.12,0,0.12,0,0,13.92,3.96,5.75,0.62,0,1.42,2.17

At least one drone and an aircraft of the US strategic reconnaissance aviation performed flights over Ukrainian territory near the area of the armed conflict in Donbass on Friday, according to data from the Flightradar global flight tracking service. The tracking service shows that an aerial vehicle codenamed UAVGH000 performed a flight over Ukraine on January 21. There is no data on it on Flightradar’s website. However, the service’s records indicate that a US RQ-4A Global Hawk strategic reconnaissance drone with this number has performed flights. The drone is capable of carrying out an air patrol at an altitude of up to 20 km for 30 hours. According to the Flightradar data, this unmanned aerial vehicle took off from an airfield on Dalma Island in the United Arab Emirates towards Ukraine. After entering Ukrainian airspace, it first performed flights along Ukraine’s border with Belarus and then in the Donbass conflict area. Also, a US Boeing RC-135W Rivet Joint strategic reconnaissance plane performed flights over Ukraine’s southern and eastern regions on Friday. As the Flightradar data shows, this aircraft was stationed at Great Yarmouth Air Base in eastern England lately and took off from UK territory towards Ukraine. It performed flights over Ukraine’s southern regions, along with the border with Crimea and subsequently along the Donbass conflict area. The aircraft headed off to its home air station after accomplishing its mission. The West and Kiev have recently been spreading allegations about Russia’s potential ‘invasion’ of Ukraine.

The Kremlin has rejected the unsubstantiated claims. According to observers, the latest ""Russian scare"" story by the US and the EU is a distraction and a bargaining chip. Bloomberg claims that Moscow is preparing for nothing short of ""a rapid, large-scale push into Ukraine from multiple locations."" Under a scenario said to have been discussed by US officials, Russia's 100,000-strong contingent would cross into Ukraine from Crimea, the Russian border and via Belarus. The newspaper admitted, however, that ""America and others are not saying a war is certain, or even that they know for sure Putin is serious about one."" Moscow has consistently rejected the US allegations, with Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denouncing the media fuss over allegations of Russian plans to invade Ukraine as ""artificial hysteria."" In contrast, NATO's naval manoeuvres in the Black Sea in close proximity to Russia's borders trigger real concern, according to the Kremlin. Biden Trying to Make Political Gains ""The US presidency is now back in the hands of what I would loosely call the neo-liberal Clinton-faction,"" says Dr. Roslyn Fuller, a Canadian-Irish author and director of the Dublin-based Solonian Democracy Institute. ""Neo-conservative Republicans and neo-liberal Democrats both favour foreign intervention. So, to some extent, what we are seeing is just a return to business as usual."" The timing of this latest ""Russia scare"" is most likely related to the forthcoming Putin-Biden meeting, argues Nicolai Petro, professor of political science at the University of Rhode Island, specialising in Ukraine and Russia. ""President Biden, who is floundering in the polls, would very much like to be able to show his Republican critics that he can 'subdue' Putin,"" Petro says. ""As the late American political scientist Murray Edelman once pointed out, there is a long tradition in American politics of establishing leadership by concocting an imminent danger (he called this 'the political spectacle'), and then making it go disappear."" However, the Biden administration appears to be stuck in 2014 and still using an old playbook, according to the academic. Petro suggests that Biden has overlooked both enormous social and structural changes that have taken place in Crimea after re-unification with Russia and Kiev's failure to forcefully push Donbass back into Ukraine. Therefore, according to the political scientist, the White House is resorting to the familiar strategy of sanctions, which though accomplishing nothing could receive bipartisan support in Congress, something that Biden desperately needs. ""Sanctions are supposed to prove that 'America is back' and leading the world,"" the professor says. Earlier this week, US Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Menendez (D-NJ) introduced an amendment that would trigger a broad range of sanctions against Moscow if the US president, in their words, determines that Russia is engaged in or knowingly supports a significant escalation in hostilities or hostile action in or against Ukraine compared to levels before 1 November 2021. Wrong Timing to Hinder Nord Stream 2 The unfolding dynamics around Ukraine are also linked to the German-Russian Nord Stream gas pipeline, with the US checking ""in one shot"" Germany, the EU and Russia to prevent ""any possible coupling in the Eurasian space,"" suggests Paolo Raffone, a strategic analyst and director of the CIPI Foundation in Brussels. The analyst cites the fact that last week Germany's energy regulator Bundesnetzagentur (BNetzA) suspended the certification process for Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline amid the latest Moscow-Washington row. ""It is quite telling that Germany discovers after 25 years that Gazprom has no legal status in the EU and therefore the technical authorization to use Nord Stream 2 is 'temporarily suspended'!"" he remarks. The US has repeatedly tried to throw sand under the wheels of the project, denouncing the EU's dependency on Russia's hydrocarbons. The European bloc gets about 40% of its imported natural gas from Russia. For its part, Kiev largely sees the pipeline as a threat to the natural gas transit through the Ukrainian territory, despite Moscow's earlier statements that the transit would not be shut down. Fuller does not rule out that EU leadership may be seeking to pin the blame for the bloc's flawed energy policies on a set of ""external factors,"" including Russia. ""There has been a lot of talk about a possible energy crisis in Europe this winter, as well as higher energy costs, and again, it's part of the general strategy to explain those issues as purely external problems that cannot be resolved or even mitigated domestically,"" she suggested. ""So I think that plays into this a bit as well."" Why US & NATO Have Zero Appetite for Confronting Russia The US-NATO military buildup in Ukraine and Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg's declarations that the transatlantic bloc ""stands"" with Kiev does not mean that ""the Council would find any common ground on any significant action towards Russia,"" deems Raffone. ""With exception of Poland, Romania, some of the Baltics, and evidently the UK, without a concrete Russian military move outside its borders it is very difficult to convince France, Germany, Turkey and Italy to support any type of NATO anti-Russian military operation,"" Raffone says. ""Why would France, Germany, Turkey and Italy commit suicide to serve American global interests?"" There is no appetite in Washington for a military confrontation with Russia, echoes Professor Robert Singh, a specialist in contemporary US politics at Birkbeck, University of London, adding that the probable US path is more economic sanctions. ""At this moment, the US in particular faces multiple problems and seems uncertain as to what it wants,"" Singh suggests. ""Washington appreciates that in expanding NATO to Russia's borders, it has taken on commitments that it may not be able or willing to honour. Ukraine is another such example. The idea of NATO membership is off the agenda, but Biden still wants to show 'solidarity' with a nation he hopes to integrate with the West, geo-politically and economically."" Although hawks in Washington may cross Russia's ""red lines"" by supplying Ukraine with additional advanced military equipment, there are several issues which are currently thwarting their agenda, according to Fuller. First, according to the author, Europeans are by no means interested in a military standoff in Ukraine, given that it is fraught with a risk of instability and a new influx of refugees, she notes. Second, ""the hawkish attitude that relies on a never-ending series of external threats is wearing thin among the American public."" Third, the positions of the Democratic neo-liberal ""establishment"" are not as solid as they used to be. ""The American 'establishment', if you will, lost the 2016 presidential election and won the 2020 one by a whisker and at great expense,"" Fuller says. ""If they are smart, they will focus on domestic issues and proceed more cautiously with foreign interventions over the next few years.""",russian,1,1140,92.24,37.05,23.89,17.19,26.51,31.4,78.42,58.68,46.32,6.4,2.02,0.18,0.53,0.09,0.61,0.53,4.39,14.74,8.95,1.75,15.09,6.05,3.25,5.09,1.05,10.79,7.19,4.04,6.23,0.88,1.32,4.12,10.44,0.35,10.09,1.58,1.14,1.49,2.72,0.61,3.16,0,3.07,1.4,1.67,0.7,0.18,0.53,0.18,0.26,0,0,7.54,4.21,0.44,0.09,0.88,0.26,2.19,3.25,0,0,0.18,0.44,6.75,5.35,1.32,0.09,3.25,0.09,0.09,2.63,0.53,0,0.44,0.09,0,0,0.09,0,0,0.18,0.09,0.26,0.26,0.44,0.18,0.35,0,0.18,0.53,0.53,2.46,10,0.7,1.05,7.37,0.88,0,0.09,2.98,1.49,5.26,1.23,0,0,0,0,0,19.82,3.68,6.75,0.09,0.09,2.19,7.02

Signed in 1992 and stepping into force in 2002, Open Skies was one of several ‘confidence-building’ treaties made between the former Cold War adversaries. Russia formally ceased its participation in the Treaty on Open Skies on Saturday, doing so after the failure by Washington’s European allies to give Moscow iron-clad guarantees that information collected during observation flights over Russian territory would not be handed over to the US. In a statement released on the occasion, the Russian Foreign Ministry said that without US and Russian participation, the effectiveness of the treaty would decline dramatically. “We respect the decision of the participating States remaining in the Treaty to continue its implementation. We wish them constructive and fruitful collaboration. However, it is obvious that without the participation of the United States and our country, the effectiveness of the Treaty on Open Skies will decrease sharply: the area of application will drop by about 80 percent, and the number of Open Skies missions planned for 2022 will severely decrease,” the ministry said. “Full responsibility for the degradation of the agreement lies at the feet of the initiator of the collapse of the Treaty on Open Skies: the United States of America,” the ministry said. Moscow’s efforts to preserve the agreement proved for naught, falling victim “to the internal struggle of various influence groups in the United States, in which the hawks took over” and took a course toward the destruction of major security agreements with Russia, the ministry added. The ministry stressed that Russia’s decision to withdraw from the treaty “was not taken without difficulty,” but ultimately made after weighing calculations of the implications for international security. During its participation in the treaty, Russia conducted 646 flights, and allowed for 449 flights to be carried out over its territory among the 1,580 total flights made. The country’s jets became the first to switch to digital surveillance equipment within the framework of the treaty. “Decades of fruitful implementation of the Treaty on Open Skies showed that it served well as a tool for strengthening confidence and security, creating additional opportunities for an objective and unbiased assessment of the military potential and military activities of the participating States,” the ministry stressed. Closed Skies The Treaty on Open Skies was negotiated, signed and ratified in 1992, and stepped into force in 2002, becoming one of numerous confidence-building measures between former Cold War adversaries after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The treaty enabled member states to freely collect information about one another’s military forces and activities on a scheduled basis using specially designated surveillance aircraft. At its peak, the treaty’s members included 34 members, among them Russia, the United States, Belarus, Ukraine and Georgia, most of NATO’s European allies, Finland, Sweden, and Canada. In May 2020, US President Donald Trump announced that Washington would be withdrawing from the agreement based on alleged “repeated violations” of its terms by Russia. Moscow dismissed the allegations, and pointed to alleged treaty violations by the US itself. Washington formally completed its withdrawal from the agreement in November 2020. Russia initially attempted to save the treaty, saying it would stay on if the remaining states (most of them US allies in NATO) could provide Moscow with firm guarantees that they would not transfer any data obtained during overflights to the Pentagon. The other participants refused to do so. In January 2021, Russia said that the US decision to scrap the agreement upset the balance of interests of the remaining participants, and announced plans to withdraw. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov hinted that Moscow would immediately reconsider its decision if the incoming Biden administration moved to return the US to the full implementation of the treaty. Candidate Biden had categorised Trump’s withdrawal from Treaty on Open Skies as a “mistake,” but did nothing to rectify the decision after coming into office. Russian President Vladimir Putin formally signed a bill renouncing the Treaty on Open Skies into law in June 2021, with Moscow giving the necessary six month notice on withdrawal to remaining members. Following Russia’s exit from the treaty, it remains unclear what Belarus – Russia’s ally under the Collective Security Treaty Organization alliance, will do next. Minsk has previously indicated that its continued participation will be carefully considered in consultation with Moscow. If Belarus follows Russia and withdraws, the only non-NATO powers left in the treaty will be Finland and Sweden. Earlier this month, Finnish President Sauli Niinisto said his country retains ""the option"" to join the alliance. The Treaty on Open Skies is one of multiple post-Cold War security agreements abandoned by Washington in over the past two decades. In 2002, the United States quit the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, prompting Moscow to dust off Soviet-era plans for the development of hypersonic weapons systems (the first of which became operational in 2017). In 2019, the Trump administration pulled out of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) – which banned the development, production and fielding of missiles in the 500 to 5,500 km range. In 2020, Trump threatened to let the clock run out on the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty – the last remaining major nuclear agreement between Russia and the United States, unless China’s nuclear arsenal was included. The Biden administration reversed Trump’s position on New START at the last minute, agreeing to extend it by five years in January 2021.",russian,1,922,99,52.35,45.25,16.52,27.12,31.34,80.8,55.86,44.03,4.77,1.19,0,0.65,0,0.11,0.43,3.58,15.51,11.17,3.8,17.9,3.47,1.74,3.9,0.43,9.44,5.53,4.34,7.59,2.17,1.41,4.01,8.68,0.33,8.35,1.63,1.95,1.08,0.98,0.43,2.28,0,3.15,1.41,1.74,0.43,0.11,0.33,0.22,0,0.11,0,6.94,3.25,0.87,0,0.43,0,0.87,4.12,0,0.11,0,0.11,7.81,6.51,0.87,0.43,1.74,0,0,1.74,0,0,0.65,0.43,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.11,0.11,0.65,0,0.33,0,0.33,0.65,0.22,2.39,10.3,0.54,1.52,8.35,0.22,0,0.22,4.88,4.34,0.65,1.3,0,0,0,0,0,14.1,3.69,5.42,0,0,1.41,3.58

Russia’s talks on security guarantees with the US and NATO, which have begun recently, raised the main question of 2022, and the near future will tell if Moscow succeeds in retaking the initiative in terms of relations with the West, a team of experts from Moscow State Institute of International Relations said in a report dubbed ""Global Threats 2022. Retaking the Initiative."" ""Developments in Ukraine, Belarus, Nagorno-Karabakh and Kazakhstan clearly show that regardless of political modalities, relations with Russia are the key factor of stability,"" the report reads. Meanwhile, the authors pointed to the difficult situation around talks on security guarantees. ""The odds are high that the United States and its allies will seek to engage Russia in an elongated negotiation process that will not lead to the necessary results and thus will not suit Moscow. In this case, the chances of Russia’s ‘military and military-technical response’ will be higher. If the US authorities show a willingness to guarantee that they will not deploy military infrastructure to Ukraine, it will reduce the risk of military activities. However, even this is unlikely to remove Moscow’s demands from the agenda,"" the analysts point out. The experts emphasized that the 2021 talks between Presidents Vladimir Putin of Russia and Joe Biden of the United States had given impetus to Russian-US dialogue in a number of fields. ""In 2022, the parties may be expected to move from consultations on strategic stability to specific discussions within working groups,"" the authors of the report said. They also believe that Moscow and Washington will highly likely avoid ""a large-scale and uncontrollable arms race"" in 2022 but can hardly be expected to agree on a common ""level of security."" Talks on security guarantees between Russia and the West make the Ukraine-related international agenda ever more important for the domestic situation in the country. At the same time, the experts noted that Ukraine was going through the most difficult crisis since Vladimir Zelensky’s election as president. The report raises the question of whether the current head of state will manage to retain his post. The report emphasizes that the dialogue on security guarantees removes the risk of provocations in other parts of the world, where the risk of tensions is not that high. Incidents may be staged in order ""to undermine the reliability of Russia’s military guarantees and show Russia’s weakness and vulnerability,"" it is also possible that ""Russia would be attacked through pressure on its allies."" ""Attempts to derail Russia’s talks with the US and NATO on security guarantees may involve new scandals based on allegations about cyberthreats coming from our country and election meddling.

As Boris Johnson arrived, hundreds of more British troops were being deployed in the Eastern European country as well as in neighboring Baltic states. The plucky message: Britain is defending Europe from those nasty Russian hordes. This plays on the overblown notion that Britain won the Second World War against Nazi Germany, even though the Third Reich was in fact built up by British ruling circles and capitalists during the 1930s. Johnson went on to accuse Russia of being a bully and urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to “de-escalate” military tensions. Then accompanied by the Polish premier, Johnson went off to greet British troops who were stationed on Poland’s border. Affecting the air of a cheery general inspecting the fortifications, Johnson queried the military engineers why they were repairing roads. “Don’t we want to stop them coming in?” asked Boris. This week Russian forces are conducting scheduled military exercises in Belarus which neighbors Poland to the East. From his remarks, it seems like the British leader thinks that Russian troops are now going to invade Poland. For weeks now, Johnson’s government has been amping up the Biden administration’s claims that Russia was going to imminently invade Ukraine. Those claims have failed to materialize which is consistent with repeated denials by Moscow of having any plans to attack Ukraine. Russia and the United Nations have condemned the war hysteria being drummed up by Washington and London through baseless speculation about imminent aggression against Ukraine. The United States and Britain have both withdrawn their embassy staff from Ukraine. President Joe Biden this week advised any American citizens in the country to “get out now”. The scaremongering by the Americans and British seems to be aimed at creating a conflict with Russia, with Ukraine as a proxy. Andrey Rudenko, Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister, remarked this week: “The situation has become completely absurd. We have repeatedly stated that we have no plans to invade or attack Ukraine.” He added this prescient comment, “Clearly, establishing peace in Ukraine is not part of NATO’s plans.” Rudenko said the Anglo-American-led NATO alliance was using tensions over Ukraine as a way to “contain” Russia by undermining its defense and economic capabilities. Despite their best malevolent efforts, Washington and London have so far failed to precipitate a full-blown war in Ukraine involving Russia. American and British officials have said they envisage Ukraine becoming another Afghanistan quagmire for Russia. But in spite of the goading, Moscow is not taking the bait. It remains steadfast in its position that it has no intention to escalate militarily over Ukraine. That’s what Putin again told French President Emmanuel Macron this week. This is why British and American lecturing to Russia about the need to de-escalate and “choose the path of diplomacy” sounds ridiculous. This lecturing was reiterated by British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss when she was in Moscow this week. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov lampooned such arrogant ultimatums as a “dead-end street”. Moscow is being admonished to de-escalate troops within its borders while British and American troops are massing near Russian territory, from the Baltic to the Black Sea and in between. British special forces are reportedly being deployed in Ukraine to train militia in techniques of sabotage, assassination and other forms of terrorism. British and Polish mercenaries are reportedly working together. It is not Russia that needs to “choose the path of diplomacy”; it is Washington and London. The Americans and British are deliberately winding up the provocations in Ukraine and Eastern Europe in order to militarize relations with Russia beyond diplomatic repair. This is part of their containment strategy. Rather than proper diplomatic negotiations between Moscow and the US-led NATO bloc on creating a mutual security treaty for Europe, the Anglo-American axis is cynically stoking tensions to preclude any reasonable dialogue. Peace and normal relations with Russia are anathemas because there is no profit for their warmongering industries that are so essential to the functioning of Anglo-American capitalism. Having failed to predict a Russian invasion of Ukraine, it seems now that Washington and London have decided to double down by casting a shadow of fear over all of Eastern Europe. And the Russophobic regimes in Poland and Baltic states are all too willing to indulge this criminal grandstanding of hostilities. Boris Johnson flying unexpectedly to Warsaw this week along with hundreds of British troops is all part of the despicable drama and psyops. The British premier avowedly models himself on Britain’s wartime hero Winston Churchill. He is also a proven liar and political con artist. While Johnson desperately struggles to stave off being sacked by his own party over non-stop scandals in Downing Street, he is prancing around Eastern Europe acting like a noble defender against “Russian invasion”.",russian,1,828,88.14,53.76,26.22,4.35,19.26,32.37,79.23,57.25,45.29,6.88,2.42,0,0.36,0,1.09,0.85,4.47,12.44,6.16,0.6,16.3,6.76,3.26,5.68,0.85,11.59,6.16,2.66,9.3,2.17,1.69,5.43,8.33,0.72,7.61,1.81,1.45,0.36,1.21,0.36,2.42,0,4.95,1.45,3.5,0.97,0.12,0.85,0.12,0.48,0,0,11.35,6.16,0.6,0.36,1.81,1.33,1.81,5.19,0,0,0.12,0.97,8.82,4.83,3.86,0.12,2.9,0.24,0.24,2.05,0.6,0,0.12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.12,0.48,0.12,0.24,0.12,0,0,0.24,0.24,0.24,3.38,9.78,0.12,0.85,7.85,0.36,0.24,0.48,3.14,3.26,4.59,1.45,0,0,0,0,0,12.8,5.07,2.29,0.12,0,0.97,4.35

Russia has dismissed the claims, stressing that it is prepared to sign new long-term contracts with its partners, and ready to start deliveries via the new Nord Stream 2 pipeline as soon as Berlin and Brussels certify the project. The construction of a major new Russian gas pipeline to China poses a threat to Europe and is a sign that Russian President Vladimir Putin has “outsmarted” the EU on energy policy, UK and US media fear. Last month, Putin and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, held a video call to discuss a range of bilateral and global issues, including the Power of Siberia 2 – a major new energy infrastructure project promising to increase Russia’s gas export capability to China by up to 50 billion cubic meters of gas per year. Putin told reporters last month that the pipeline’s proposed route (which includes a stretch through Mongolia), its length and other features have already been agreed upon, and that a study on feasibility will be completed soon. Putin also met with Mongolian President Ukhnaagiin Khurelsukh in Moscow on 16 December to discuss the project. Energy industry observers told Nikkei Asia that the pipeline, which looks to be nearing approval, would be a win-win for both Russia and China. Beijing would receive access to much-needed gas supplies amid a global gas crunch and its shift away from coal power, while Moscow would reduce its dependence on the fickle European Union, which has complained about shortages and spiking spot prices while simultaneously dragging out the certification of Nord Stream 2 – the new gas pipeline was completed last fall with the capacity to provide up to 55 billion cubic meters in additional gas to the region. Power of Siberia 2 would complement the existing Power of Siberia pipeline, which was commissioned in 2019, and will have a maximum capacity of up to 38 billion cubic meters of gas per year when fully up and running in the year 2024. That 2,200 km project has an estimated price tag of about $14.5 billion US, with the Power of Siberia 2 expected to cost in the neighbourhood of $10-$13.6 billion. One important difference between the two projects is that while Power of Siberia takes its gas from fields in eastern Siberia, Power of Siberia 2 will be able to pump gas from Yamal – the massive fields in western Siberia which have provided gas to western Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Europe for decades. Depending on the state of negotiations, Power of Siberia 2 could be built and come online as soon as 2027, with a projected full completion date expected by 2030. Russia’s 'Terror' Pipeline Britain’s tabloid press have sounded the alarm about the Power of Siberia 2 project, with the Daily Express running back-to-back stories with the provocative headlines “Putin outsmarts EU as new China gas deal to pump ‘same amount’ as banned German pipeline” and “China tipped to copy Russia’s Ukraine tactics with Taiwan as pair link up to cause terror.” “Experts” cited by the articles claim, incredulously, that Russia may be deliberately “tinkering with gas supplies” to put pressure on the EU to approve Nord Stream 2, while at the same time looking east to China to give Moscow “more options about who gets the gas and at what price”. These “options,” they fear, may exacerbate Europe’s gas shortages. The more highbrow Telegraph expressed similar concerns, with its article, “Russia looks east as China link threatens to inflame Europe’s gas crisis,” warning that the gas which has heated European homes and provided much-needed energy to European industry for so many years may soon be sent eastward instead. “Experts warn of the impact on European energy security and prices, and of Moscow’s growing grip on global markets at a turbulent time for energy supplies in the push to slash carbon emissions,” the outlet suggested. Worse yet, the Telegraph bitterly asserted, while European countries’ preference for short-term contracts for gas has forced them to pay through the nose as spot prices on wholesale supplies have jumped over 800 percent over the past year, China “can afford to buy greater amounts”, since “it has been purchasing pipeline gas through long-term contracts linked to oil prices”. The outlet estimated that in October 2021, China paid between $4-7 per Mmbtu for its gas even as Europeans shelled out over $20 per Mmbtu during the same period. 'Opportunities to Turn Supplies Off and On' Voice of America, the US government-funded broadcaster, called the Power of Siberia 2 negotiations a sign of a coming Russian ‘gas pivot’ to China which “poses a challenge to Europe”. The State Department mouthpiece accused Russia of deliberately “worsening” the European energy crunch, claiming that Gazprom has “shrugged off urgent European requests for more natural gas”. One anonymous senior European diplomat worriedly told the outlet that Russia’s diversification of supplies to China will “give the Kremlin more opportunities to turn off and on supplies to Europe but reduce considerably any financial risks for Russia.” Among English-language reporting on Power of Siberia 2, only Bloomberg called for calm, with contributor David Fickling penning a piece for the business outlet entitled “A gas pipeline won’t turn Russia and China into buddies.” In it, the author assured readers that historically, “China and Russia have rarely seen eye-to-eye for very long,” and recalled the 60-year-old dispute between Nikita Khrushchev and Mao Zedong, Soviet-Chinese border conflicts, and “rival spheres of influence in Central Asia”. Fickling did not specify how a new, commercially viable gas pipeline with positive energy security implications for both countries impacts any “buddy” relationship Moscow and Beijing might have. Russia and the US-allied European Union aren’t considered “buddies” by foreign policy observers, but that hasn’t stopped Gazprom from selling the Europeans about 180 billion cubic meters of gas per year, accounting for about 40 percent of the region’s demand. Gazprom reiterated last month that it remains ready to sign new long-term gas contracts with European countries. The company has rejected “groundless” claims that it was withholding supplies to the European market, pointing out that its sales to Europe have increased by double digits in 2021 compared to the previous year. Russian officials have pointed to Europe’s over-dependence on short-term contracts, failure to stock up reserves after a cold winter and spring of 2021, lavish spending on wind and solar energy whose returns proved more meagre than expected, and growing competition between Europe and Asia for limited supplies as the causes for the current energy shortages.",russian,1,1097,96.76,36.93,21.94,18.09,37.83,28.9,74.38,54.15,41.84,4.28,0.73,0,0.27,0,0.09,0.18,3.56,11.49,7.11,3.74,17.87,4.74,2.37,5.38,0.36,8.39,6.02,5.01,4.47,0.73,1,3.01,5.29,0,5.29,0.46,1,0.73,1.19,0.27,2.1,0.09,3.1,1.46,1.64,0.64,0.09,0.55,0.46,0,0,0,5.56,3.83,0.27,0.09,0.64,0.18,1.55,1.64,0,0.27,0,0.09,3.01,1.28,1.64,0.09,5.01,0,0.18,3.37,1.73,0,0.36,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.18,0,0.46,0.09,0.46,0,0.18,0.82,0,2.92,8.39,0.46,1.28,6.2,0.46,0.09,0.27,4.65,2.92,2.28,2.28,0,0,0,0,0,16.32,2.83,5.01,0,0,1.91,6.56

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that evidence suggests Russia is planning ""the biggest war in Europe since 1945."" “All the signs are that the plan has already in some senses begun,"" said Johnson in an interview for BBC One's Sunday Morning Programme, hosted by Sophie Raworth. ""People need to understand the sheer cost in human life that could entail,"" Johnson continued, as cited by the BBC, pointing to intelligence purportedly suggesting Russia intended to launch an invasion that would encircle the Ukrainian capital Kiev. Western officials have been whipping up hysteria for some time now, spreading falsehoods that Russian troops deployed to its southern regions for drills were a prelude to an “imminent” invasion of Ukraine, despite Moscow denying the claims, saying its troops were conducting military exercises in the region. The scandal-mired UK Prime Minister, who has been under fire at home over allegations that he and members of his Cabinet had taken part in private parties amid strict coronavirus restrictions in the country, was speaking from Munich, where world leaders are meeting for an annual security conference. Johnson indicated that the UK would slap Russia with even more far-reaching sanctions than previously suggested, with his country and the US stopping Russian companies ""trading in pounds and dollars"" in a move that would ""hit very, very hard"". Asked whether a Russian “invasion” was still deemed “imminent”, an allegation peddled by the West that UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss recently echoed, claiming that in London's view the ""invasion"" was both ""imminent"" and ""highly likely"", Johnson responded: ""I'm afraid that that is what the evidence points to, there's no burnishing it. The fact is that all the signs are that the plan has already in some senses begun."" The PM cited US President Joe Biden as telling Western leaders that intelligence suggested Russian forces were not just planning on invading Ukraine from the east, in Donbass, but also from Belarus and the area surrounding Kiev. ""I'm afraid to say that the plan we are seeing is for something that could be really the biggest war in Europe since 1945 just in terms of sheer scale,"" warned Johnson. In a fit of scaremongering, he urged people to consider the potential loss of life of Ukrainians, as well as ""young Russians"". Boris Johnson was speaking after meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Munich, with the two agreeing upon ""joint next steps"" while ostensibly pursuing de-escalation and diplomacy. Earlier, addressing the Munich security Conference, Boris Johnson told those gathered that any invasion of Ukraine by Russia would ""echo around the world"". He also warned that an alleged invasion launched by the Kremlin would be met with sanctions as the UK would ""open up the Matryoshka dolls"" of certain Russian-owned companies, stripping them of the opportunity to raise money in London. In late January, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss had announced new legislation to expand the UK's sanctions regime so that “any company of interest to the Kremlin and the regime in Russia"" could be targeted in the event of aggression against Ukraine. Russia responded by warning that any threat of more sanctions would result in hurting British companies and shareholders, with the Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov calling the planned move ""an undisguised attack on business"" and said it would prompt retaliatory measures ""based on our interests"". The interview comes as tensions on the line of contact between Ukraine and the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) and Lugansk People's Republic (LPR) have deteriorated in the past days. Kiev intensified its shelling of the outskirts of the city of Donetsk using artillery prohibited by the 2015 Minsk agreements, said the mission of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic to the Joint Centre for Control and Coordination on the ceasefire regime (JCCC) early on Sunday. On Sunday the Ukrainian forces attempted to attack the positions of the People's Militia of the self-proclaimed Lugansk People's Republic (LPR), but suffered losses and retreated, according to the people's police of the LPR. The two self-proclaimed republics announced the evacuation of their citizens on Friday due to the escalation of tensions on the line of contact in southeastern Ukraine and amid fears of an attack by Kiev forces. Over 3,100 people were evacuated on Saturday from the LPR to Russia, while the DPR evacuated 6,600 people, including almost 2,500 children as of Saturday, according to the DPR Ministry of Emergency Situations. The evacuations from Donbass to Russia comes as DPR head Denis Pushilin said on Friday that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky would soon order Kiev forces to launch an offensive in Donbass, in order to implement a plan to invade the DPR and LPR. The recent developments follow months of rhetoric from Western countries and Kiev, accusing Russia of preparing for an alleged ""invasion"" of Ukraine. In response, Moscow has denied these claims, repeatedly stating that it is not threatening anyone and at the same time expressing its concerns over NATO's military activity near Russia's borders, which it considers as a threat to its national security.",russian,1,881,96.82,52.93,38.13,2.86,35.24,31.44,79.11,54.26,44.84,6.02,1.59,0.23,0.34,0,0.57,0.23,4.43,15.21,9.53,0.91,17.25,5.68,2.27,4.54,0.34,9.88,4.43,2.27,7.72,0.79,1.02,5.9,8.29,0.34,7.95,1.59,1.82,1.48,1.25,0.11,1.25,0,4.54,1.02,3.52,0.79,0,0.79,0.34,0.23,0,0,9.88,5.45,0,0,1.36,0.34,3.29,3.63,0,0,0,0.68,4.54,3.18,1.36,0,2.84,0.11,0.11,2.38,0.57,0,0.34,0.11,0.11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.23,0,0.23,0,0,0,0.23,1.7,0.11,2.5,12.15,0.57,1.14,9.53,0.23,0.23,0.68,4.77,4.43,2.61,1.59,0,0,0,0,0,17.03,2.84,5.33,0,0,1.82,7.04

Ukraine's Donbass region during the past few days has been the site of an ongoing armed conflict, with its roots in the 2014 Euromaidan coup in Kiev. Russia in February 2022 recognised the independence of the breakaway Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics. April 2014 While the new government in Ukraine was swiftly recognised by Western powers, many residents of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions of the country did not appear to be keen to follow suit. Tensions with Kiev led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, DPR and LPR, respectively. May 2014 Amid clashes between DPR and LPR supporters and Ukrainian government forces, the two self-proclaimed republics held referendums on self-determination on 11 May 2014, proclaiming their independence the following day. In response, Kiev deployed additional armed forces under the auspices of a so-called ""Anti-Terrorist Operation"" in an attempt to bring these breakaway regions to heel, and began using heavy weapons and military aircraft in a rapidly-escalating conflict. September 2014 Kiev's attempt to crush the DPR and LPR militias through force of arms proved unsuccessful, as, despite being outnumbered and outgunned, these groups offered stiff resistance to the Ukrainian military and paramilitary groups deployed against them. The Minsk Protocol, signed in the capital of Belarus by the Trilateral Contact Group on Ukraine (Ukraine, the Russian Federation, and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe) and by the heads of the DPR and LPR, was aimed at implementing a ceasefire but failed to stop the fighting in the region. February 2015 After weeks of fighting, a comprehensive ceasefire and peace agreement was signed in Minsk by Ukraine and three guarantor nations: Russia, Germany, and France. This agreement, often referred to as the Second Minsk Agreement, halted the fighting in Donbass, but did not resolve the disagreements, turning it instead into a frozen conflict. Currently, Kiev has refused to fulfill the political portion of the agreement, and initiate constitutional reforms to grant the self-proclaimed republics broader autonomy in exchange for their return to Ukrainian jurisdiction. Throughout the conflict, the Ukrainian government has repeatedly accused Russia of providing military assistance to DPR and LPR militia forces, and even directly participating in the conflict. Moscow has consistently denied the accusations, and Kiev has not been able to provide tangible evidence to back up its claims. Russia, however, has never concealed that it provides humanitarian aid to DPR and LPR, which Moscow previously regarded as part of Ukraine, not as independent entities. Current Situation Until the most recent escalation, the situation in Donbass has remained in limbo, as sporadic exchanges of small arms fire between the sides and reports of shelling become a common occurrence. On 17 February 2022, however, Ukrainian forces intensified the shelling of the DPR and LPR territories, hitting civilian targets and prompting local authorities to initiate a mass temporary evacuation of women and children to Russia.

He made this statement at a meeting with the country's government on Thursday. ""We furnish Europe with heat, yet they threaten to close the border. And what if we shut off natural gas there?

""But it is up to them. If they close it (the border - TASS) let them do it,"" Lukashenko said. At the same time, he ordered the Foreign Ministry ""to warn everyone in Europe: if they introduce additional sanctions that are ‘undigestible’ and ‘unacceptable’ for us, then we should respond."" ""How to respond, we agreed with you about it half a year ago,"" the President of Belarus said. Lukashenko reiterated that as a tough response to the new packages of EU sanctions, his country may shut off transit. ""What if we close the transit through Belarus? Through Ukraine it won’t work: the Russian border is closed there, there are no roads through the Baltic states. If we close it for the Poles and, for example, for the Germans, what will happen next? We should stop at nothing to protect our sovereignty and independence,"" Lukashenko said commenting on Warsaw’s plans to close the Polish-Belarusian border.

He also expressed hope that the United States and the European Union will work to resolve the crisis peacefully. ""By signing the decree, President Putin has made clear his seriousness and willingness to take further action,” Black said. ""Hopefully this will cause the US and European powers to work toward resolving matters in a way that avoids bloodshed for both Russians and Ukrainians."" The recognition of the breakaway republics in the Donbas region should not come as a surprise, however, the ex-senator said, recalling that the Russian lower house, when asking Putin to do it last week, said that it was ""morally justified because Ukraine had abrogated its responsibilities under the Minsk agreements, conducted artillery shelling of the region, and imposed an economic blockade on the population."" The Minsk agreements is a package of de-escalation measures in the eastern Ukrainian conflict negotiated from 2014-2015 within the so-called Normandy format, involving France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine. Moscow has repeatedly accused Kiev of violating the deal. ""Putin’s decree effectively ends the Minsk agreements, which Russia doggedly sought to implement without cooperation from Ukraine or NATO. Under those agreements, Donbas would have gained significant autonomy while remaining part of Ukraine,"" Black said. ""Since Minsk was ignored, the actions of the Duma [Russian lower house] were predictable."" The former lawmaker believes that Putin's signing of the DPR and LPR independence decree creates a new level of uncertainty. ""It is not clear what boundaries are covered by it. Under one scenario, much of the land is occupied by Ukrainian troops, inviting armed conflict over lands they presently hold,"" he explained. ""The world would be less apprehensive if the only areas covered by the decree were those lands which the DPR and LPR presently holds. If that is the intent, it would be helpful to say so."" Black believes that several other nations will also recognize the DPR and LPR. ""Nations like Belarus, Kazakhstan, Syria, Venezuela, and Cuba have recently benefited from Russian assistance and can be expected to reciprocate. At first, the new states will not be widely recognized, but they will not be diplomatically isolated either,"" he said. Black expressed hope that both the United States and Europe will now understand the gravity of the threat to Russia's vital national security interests posed by ""NATO’s de facto encroachment into Ukraine."" ""Until now, they have been dismissive of Russia’s genuine apprehensions,"" he stressed. ""The US had 200 Florida National Guard troops deployed inside of Ukraine, and Canada had its troops deployed there too. Actions such as those were an unacceptable threat to Russia. That should have been obvious to anyone. Yet until now, politicians have seemed oblivious to the danger that NATO’s reckless eastward advance caused for both Russia and even Western nations too."" Although Biden has so far resisted cries for immediate sanctions, there will be renewed discussions to decide whether Putin’s actions warrant sanctions now, the ex-lawmaker opined. ""There is still reluctance by European states to back sanctions, so the president’s decree alone might not trigger them. However, President Putin’s comments suggesting that Ukraine should have remained an integral part of Russia after the Soviet Union’s dissolution is causing nervousness across Europe,"" he said. Black believes that independent non-aligned Ukraine with a buffer against war for both sides would provide stability in the region. ""Ideally, Ukraine would be treated as Austria was during the Cold War, when the Soviet Union permitted it to become a sovereign, non-aligned, demilitarized buffer between East and West,"" he explained. In 1955, the Austrian parliament incorporated the Declaration of Neutrality into its constitution, declaring that Austria would remain permanently neutral and would neither join military alliances nor permit foreign bases to be established on its territory. ""From that time forward, Austria stepped aside from East-West tensions, and everyone benefited,"" Black said. If, however, Russia attacked and advanced west of the Dnieper River, it would ""create fear and perhaps unite NATO in a serious way,"" the ex-state senator said. He would expect this scenario to ""rouse passions"" among NATO countries such as Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, and Finland. ""Undoubtedly, a move west of the river would trigger sanctions limiting Russian access to financial systems like the SWIFT system for settlement of international transactions,"" Black said. The situation in the breakaway Donbas region has escalated in recent days, with the DPR and LPR reporting increased shelling by the Ukrainian forces and ordering general mobilization in anticipation of an offensive by the government in Kiev. The local authorities began evacuating civilians to Russia on Friday, aiming to take up to 700,000 people into safety. In 2014, the Ukrainian authorities launched a military operation against the DPR and LPR after they declared independence following what they considered a coup in Kiev. Early clashes escalated into a protracted military conflict that claimed thousands of lives and displaced over 2 million Ukrainians.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has responded to remarks made by British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who earlier weighed in on the migrant crisis unfolding on the Poland-Belarus border, urging Russia’s President Vladimir Putin to step in and end Minsk’s attempt to use “desperate migrants as pawns” to destabilise the region. “Russia has a clear responsibility here. They must press the Belarusian authorities to end the crisis and enter into dialogue,” wrote Truss in The Telegraph, as she deplored what she referred to as a “carefully crafted crisis” that she blamed on the government of Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko. “The UK’s intervention in Iraq – now that was ‘carefully crafted’. 45 thousand British soldiers helped the United States occupy that country, kill its citizens and plunder its riches. Britain bears a clear historical responsibility for everything that happens from that moment in the region - the death of Iraqis, the destruction of Iraqi statehood, endless flows of refugees, the emergence of Daesh*, humanitarian disasters in this part of the world,” wrote Zakharova on Telegram on Sunday. Truss, in her column for The Telegraph, had insisted that Britain would “not look away” in a situation when its European allies were being forced to “bear the brunt” of a manipulated situation designed to distract from a “litany of abhorrent acts and human rights violations” ostensibly perpetrated by Alexander Lukashenko’s government. “Until London is held accountable for its crimes, its officials have no right to accuse anyone,” remonstrated Maria Zakkarova. On Sunday, Liz Truss had also underscored that the UK stood with its allies in the region, besides Poland, such as others in the Visegrad Four – Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic – and “friends in the Baltics and Ukraine”. The British Foreign Secretary even went as far as to urge the European Union to reconsider dependence on Russia for gas supplies by cancelling the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, completed on 10 September and awaiting certification. “It risks undermining European security by allowing Russia to tighten its grip on those nations who rely on its gas, despite the pandemic reminding us about the importance of having diverse supply chains to avoid being strategically dependent on unreliable partners,” Truss said of Nord stream 2. ‘Crisis of Their Own Making’ The crisis on Belarus’ borders with Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, where tens of thousands of migrants, primarily from the Middle East and Africa, have traveled since the beginning of the year, sharply escalated on 8 November. Several thousand people had arrived at the border with Poland and set up camp there, with many hoping to make their way into the European Union and travel further west, presumably to Germany. Brussels has blamed Minsk for the escalation of the situation, accusing it of using migrants as a ""hybrid weapon"". Some EU countries demanding fresh sanctions against Belarus. President Alexander Lukashenko redirected the blame for the crisis towards the Western countries themselves, who had fueled a situation that prompted the people to flee their war-ravaged nations amid decades of military interventions in the Middle East and North Africa. Furthermore, Lukashenko emphasised that previous rounds of EU sanctions against Belarus have drained his country's ability to control migration flows. *Daesh (aka ISIL, ISIS) is a terrorist organization banned in Russia and other countries.",russian,1,590,97.54,55.22,16.31,3.23,31.05,32.54,76.78,54.75,44.24,7.12,2.54,0,0.17,0,1.02,0.85,4.58,15.25,9.32,1.53,17.97,3.73,2.2,4.41,0.34,8.31,5.08,1.69,5.25,1.02,0.51,3.73,8.14,0.34,7.8,0.85,3.39,0.51,0.34,0,1.53,0.17,4.07,0.85,3.22,0.68,0.17,0.51,0,0.17,0,0,9.32,5.25,0.85,0,0.68,1.53,1.86,4.24,0,0.17,1.02,0.17,6.27,3.73,2.54,0,2.2,0,0,2.03,0.17,0,0.51,0.17,0.17,0,0,0,0,0,0.34,1.53,0.17,0,0,0.17,0,0,1.86,0,2.54,9.49,0.34,1.53,7.46,0.17,0,0.17,2.88,4.24,1.53,0.17,0.17,0.17,0,0,0,16.95,3.22,5.93,0,0,1.53,6.27

Geopolitical tensions could weaken the Russian ruble to 77 rubles per dollar or more, according to experts interviewed by TASS. The dollar continued to grow against the ruble on Monday with the highest values since July 2021. Experts consider geopolitical tensions to be the most significant factor among the reasons for the current weakening of the ruble, including the tensions in Ukraine, the migration crisis in Belarus, as well as the Karabakh conflict (a new round of escalation and casualties), experts from Loko-Invest noted. At the same time, Freedom Finance analyst Alexander Osin believes that regulators are using the factor of non-market pressure on demand for risky assets (including sanctions and geopolitical ones) in order to restore demand for low-yield, ""quality"" assets due to a significant decline in inflation. Further deterioration of the international politics can undoubtedly push the ruble against the dollar to the level of 75-77 rubles and even more, investment strategist at BCS World of Investments Alexander Bakhtin believes. Loko-Invest does not rule out that even with a stable market situation, the risk premium may weaken the ruble to 75-77 rubles per dollar in the short term due to geopolitical tensions. ""Everything will depend on how large-scale the potential threats may be in their consequences. So far there is no reason to believe that the geopolitical situation in the near future will only get worse,"" Bakhtin added. Freedom Finance expects the ruble to consolidate over the next month (roughly before the date of the Bank of Russia meeting on December 17, 2021) at around 67-79 rubles per dollar and 78-92 rubles per euro.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has traditionally addressed world leaders and heads of international organizations with Christmas and New Year greetings, the Kremlin press service said on Thursday. In his messages to most of them, he noted the strengthening of relations despite the pandemic and recalled that the development of cooperation with Moscow was in the interests of their peoples. TASS has summarized the highlights of the Russian president’s messages of greetings to foreign counterparts. In his Christmas and New Year greetings to the President of the United States of America, Joseph Biden, with whom he plans to have a telephone conversation this evening, Vladimir Putin noted that Moscow and Washington bore a special responsibility for international and regional stability and could and should interact constructively, combining efforts to respond to the numerous challenges and threats facing humanity. ""I am confident that, following up on our agreements reached during the June summit in Geneva and subsequent meetings, we can move forward and establish an effective Russian-American dialogue based on mutual respect and consideration for each other’s national interests,"" the message says. In his greetings to the Federal President of the Federal Republic of Germany Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Federal Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz Putin noted the need for the international community to come together and join its efforts to face the multiple challenges Europe and the entire world were facing.

Just as on the previous occasion, Putin sent separate greetings to the King and the Queen of Spain (but not the head of government) and Sweden’s new Prime Minister (but not the royal couple), the Prince of Monaco, and the leaders of Greece, Canada, Serbia, Slovenia, and Croatia. The meetings with Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev in the outgoing year confirmed the strong partnership between Moscow and Baku, and regular contacts with Armenia’s Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, the relations of the alliance, Putin said in his greetings to the leaders of the two countries. Russia and Belarus this year cooperated tightly and effectively in addressing large-scale tasks in bilateral relations despite the pandemic and external pressures, Putin wrote to his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko, with whom he had held a bilateral meeting after the informal CIS summit in St. Petersburg and played hockey on Wednesday. Putin described as successful Russia’s relations with the Central Asian countries. In his messages to their leaders, he noted the steady development of bilateral ties. The Russian leader congratulated Moldova’s President Maia Sandu and the leaders of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Aslan Bzhania and Anatoly Bibilov. Messages to the leadership of Georgia and Ukraine are not mentioned in the Kremlin’s news release, just as last year. Russia and China cooperated productively in various spheres, Putin said.

""The implementation of the agreements reached will help further expand productive Russia-India cooperation in various areas,"" Putin noted. Putin appreciated last October’s telephone conversation with Japan’s new Prime Minister, Fumio Kishida, and confirmed the determination to have further contracts. He expressed the hope for the further dialogue with South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in, but last year’s plans for a visit to Seoul were not mentioned in the Kremlin’s news release. The Russian leader sent greetings to the leadership of Vietnam and Mongolia’s President Ukhnaagiin Khurelsukh, who had visited Russia just recently. Putin sent greetings to the leaders of three countries in the Middle East - Israel, Syria and Turkey. In the message to Israel’s President Yitzhak Herzog and Prime Minister Naftali Bennet he expressed the hope for further constructive joint work. To the Syrian leader, Bashar Assad, Putin promised Moscow’s continued support for Damascus, and in the message to Recep Tayyip Erdogan he mentioned a good outlook for cooperation in outer space and vaccine production. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is not mentioned in the Kremlin’s news release, but Putin held a telephone conversation with him on Thursday. In the message of greetings to Argentina’s President Alberto Fernandez Putin noted the firm and comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries and tangible positive results in the joint struggle against the pandemic. To Brazil’s leader Jair Bolsonaro Putin expressed the hope for the further constructive dialogue in bilateral relations and in international organizations. Separate messages were sent to Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro, to his Cuban counterpart Miguel Diaz Canel and to Raul Castro. Just as last year, South Africa was the sole African country mentioned on the list of Putin’s greetings. ""I hope that in 2022 we will continue to work closely to strengthen the multifaceted interaction between Russia and South Africa This fully meets the interests of our peoples and helps strengthen international stability and security,"" the message to South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa says.

US Vice President Kamala Harris during her trip to the Munich Conference later this week will ensure the United States is aligned with its allies and partners in Europe on the Ukraine situation, a senior US administration official told reporters. ""The key objective for her [Harris'] trip now is to focus on this fast-changing, evolving situation, this tremendous challenge we are facing now, to make sure that we are fully aligned with our allies and partners, and to make sure that we have sent a very clear message to Russia... which is that there are two paths: our preference is diplomacy and deterrence but if Russia chooses aggression, we are ready, the US is ready, our allies are ready"", the official said on Wednesday. The official also accused Russia of allegedly deploying an additional 7,000 troops near its border with Ukraine over the last several days, adding that Washington and its allies would be ready if there is an invasion. Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov earlier announced that Moscow was withdrawing some of its forces from the border with Ukraine. On the same day, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu told Russian President Vladimir Putin that some drills with Belarus had ended while others were continuing as planned. The joint Russia-Belarus drills are expected to finish up on Sunday. Also on Wednesday, State Department spokesperson Ned Price told reporters that American concerns over an ""incursion into Ukraine"" have not diminished, claiming, ""we are in a window where [Russian President Vladimir] Putin could order an invasion or an attack on Ukraine at a moment's notice"". The West and Kiev have accused Russia of a troop buildup near the Ukrainian border in alleged preparation for an ""invasion"".

""For some reason, the Ukrainian leadership decided to carry out drills practically on the state border under the guise of combating illegal migration.

How Western Tabloids Indulge in Stoking  Russian Invasion  Narrative",English,Russia,"Hardly anything has ever been fostered by the Western media quite like the unageing narrative of the ""Russian threat"". It has long been cultivated in mainstream media outlets, but a Thursday Bloomberg report about plans of an alleged ""Russian invasion"" of Ukraine appeared to breathe new life into it. Western mainstream media have ramped up the ""Russian threat"" narrative with reports of Russian troop deployments in Belarus amid an unfolding migrant crisis at the Belarusian border with Poland. The Daily Mail ran a story on Friday titled ""East and West go toe-to-toe"", focusing on how Russia is carrying out ""snap military drills in Belarus [...], as fears grow that [Russian President] Vladimir Putin is preparing for an invasion in eastern Europe"". The report emphasises that the drills are taking place ""just 20 miles from where thousands of migrants are gathered at the Polish border"". Belarus stresses that the drills were launched in response to a ""military build-up"" on its borders. Warsaw has amassed 15,000 troops and invited British soldiers to its eastern border as migrants from the Middle East try to make their way to the EU through Belarus. However, the British deployment in Poland has not sparked a proportionate storm in the Western media - even in the wake of Russia and Belarus unveiling an integration plan that envisages the coordination of migration and security policies. The Russians are Coming?! The Polish storyline fits perfectly into the ""Russia warmongering"" narrative that has dominated the tabloids in recent days. As of Friday, the front pages of outlets such as The Sun, The Mirror, The Daily Mirror, and many others were filled with articles dedicated to the alleged plans of a ""Russian invasion"" or the Russian drills in Belarus - or both at the same time. The hot topic was also not left unnoticed by the UK's Daily Express, which rolled out a report titled ""Putin warmongering hits UK"", dedicated to how a British plane was diverted from the south-western part of the Crimean Peninsula by a Russian Su-30 fighter, underlining that it happened"" after Russia sent two nuclear bombers over Belarus as the dispute between Belarus and Poland intensifies"". ""VLADIMIR PUTIN has added to growing war fears after a British spy plane was diverted as it approached the Russian border in Crimea, just a day after it sent nuclear bombers over Belarus"", the report reads, without elaborating on how diverting a foreign plane from a state border could add to ""growing war fears"". The Daily Express goes on to cite Poland’s Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who went even further and put the blame for the ongoing migrant crisis between Belarus and Poland on Russia. “This attack which Lukashenko is conducting has its mastermind in Moscow, the mastermind is President Putin"", Morawiecki said, as cited by the outlet. A cascade of such stories ensued after Bloomberg reported on Thursday that the United States had ""privately alerted their European allies"" of a possible ""Russian invasion"" allegedly being planned by the Kremlin. 'Russian Invasion' Amid the media-fuelled ""invasion"" hysteria, reports about Russian troop movements near Ukraine were denied by Moscow as ""groundless"". Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov underlined that the movements of Russian troops, as long as they take place within the country's own territory, should not be a cause for anyone's concerns. ""We go about our own business, and we take measures to ensure our security if necessary if some provocative actions by our opponents occur near our borders"", he said, referring to how NATO continues to ""actively and assertively"" operate in the vicinity of the Russian borders. Concerns voiced in the Western media in regard to the Russian-Belarusian military drills come amid Moscow and Minsk continuing their efforts to establish stronger defence ties between the two countries under the Union State agreement. ""As recent events have shown, the Union’s regional grouping of troops is a reliable security shield not only for our countries but also for the entire post-Soviet space. President [of Russia Vladimir Putin] and I do not hide our intentions to bolster this grouping in the future"", Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said in early November.

The Russian Foreign Ministry accused NATO on Friday of ""escalation for the sake of escalation"" in the ongoing crisis in Eastern Europe, where the alliance has accused Moscow of planning an invasion of Ukraine. ""The military-political situation in Europe continues to degrade. Russian proposals on security guarantees are aimed at correcting this situation, to which we have not received a clear answer from the alliance,"" Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said in a Friday statement. ""We hope that negotiations on them will continue. We will insist on NATO stopping its provocative expansion policy, refusing to deploy strike weapons that threaten us near our borders, and returning the configuration of the alliance's forces to the positions of 1997,"" she added. Moscow has denied any intent to invade Ukraine, and the Ukrainian government has likewise said that Russian troops near its borders are insufficient to constitute an invasion threat. Nonetheless, the US government and Western media have continued to claim that such an attack could happen ""at any time,"" and even that Moscow might try and use a ""false flag"" incident to create a casus belli. The US State Department levied just such an accusation on Friday, telling Sputnik that it regards news from the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) of explosions and artillery shelling by Ukrainian forces as a ""false flag operation."" ""Announcements like these are further attempts to obscure through lies and disinformation that Russia is the aggressor in this conflict. This type of false flag operation is exactly what Secretary [Antony] Blinken highlighted in his remarks to the UN Security Council,"" a State Department spokesperson told Sputnik. ""It is also cynical and cruel to use human beings as pawns to distract the world from the fact that Russia is building up its forces in preparation for an attack. Russia is the sole instigator of these tensions and is threatening the people of Ukraine. It has put its troops on Ukraine's borders, and routinely abuses and violates the rights of the people of Donbas and Crimea,"" they added. The DPR and its sister republic, the Lugansk People's Republic (LPR), are breakaway states in the Russophone Donbass region, which declared independence from Kiev in 2014 after a nationalist government came to power and attempted to reduce the status the Russian language as a national language in Ukraine. The eight-year war between them and Kiev has killed at least 14,000 people. Denis Pushilin, the head of the DPR, announced on Friday that some 700,000 civilians were being evacuated eastward into Russia's Rostov region, warning that  ""a full-scale offensive can simply begin"" at any moment. Earlier this week, the Russian State Duma passed a resolution calling on Russian President Vladimir Putin to recognize the two Donbass republics as independent states, but he has so far declined to do so. Ukraine and NATO have accused Moscow of secretly supporting the rebels, but they have denied any interference in Ukrainian affairs.

It was always de facto, and became de jure after the 2014 referendum,"" the top diplomat said when asked what had to be done for Minsk to formalize its recognition of Crimea. Earlier, President Lukashenko said that he intended to visit Crimea together with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Crimean leader Sergey Aksyonov said that this decision by the Belarusian president ""was quite in the spirit of brotherly relations between the peoples of Russia and Belarus.""

Russia will respond to any hostile actions by the Western powers with adequate military measures, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has said. ""You must understand why this subject has arisen: It is because of the continued hostile actions being taken by NATO countries, to which Russia's leadership has responded by saying that if all of this continues, such hostile, unfriendly, aggressive actions will be met with an adequate response, including in the military-technical sphere,"" Zakharova said, speaking at a briefing Friday, and responding to a question about the possible deployment of Russian nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory. ""Therefore there's no need to invent the idea that these are special, secret plans. Nothing of the kind. This is a sober assessment of the situation on the planet, [based on] an understanding of the strategy and tactics of countries and political systems with which we must now do business...and the creation of appropriate measures, goals and tasks based on this,"" she added. On Tuesday, the Foreign Ministry confirmed that all options, including the deployment of nuclear weapons in Belarus, would be considered in the event of NATO's refusal to discuss Russia's twin security proposals - which demand a halt to the alliance's eastward expansion into Ukraine, and propose other means to ease tensions. Last week, Belarusian Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei indicated that Minsk would consider the possibility of deploying Russian nuclear weapons on its territory if NATO put nukes in Poland. Moscow handed the US and NATO a pair of detailed security proposals last week, recommending legally binding commitments by Moscow and Washington not to deploy weapons and troops in areas where they may be perceived as a threat to the other party's national security,  setting limits on the deployment of intermediate and shorter-range missiles, demanding that NATO halt its eastward expansion, and abandon its military activities in Ukraine, the Caucasus and Central Asia. Russian officials have warned that the proposals must be ""evaluated in their totality"" and are ""not...a menu, where it is possible to pick and choose"". Moscow has also warned that it will be forced to create a system of ""counterthreats"" to the US and NATO should the Western alliance reject the security proposals out of hand. On Thursday, a senior Biden administration official told reporters that the US would be prepared to hold security talks with Russia in January, and said that Washington would not provide a substantive response to Russia's proposals in public. ""There are some issues that Russia has raised that we believe we can discuss and others they know very well we never agree to,"" the official said. At his year-end press conference Thursday, President Putin indicated that Russia's future actions would depend on ""unconditional guarantees of Russian national security, rather than the course of negotiations"" with the West. ""We have made it clear that NATO's expansion eastward is unacceptable. The US is on our doorstep with its missiles. How would Americans react if we were to place our missiles at the US border with Canada or Mexico?"" Putin said. Also Thursday, NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said NATO never promised not to expand, and suggested that its further expansion was ""not something we can change through some quotes."" In 1990, US Secretary of State James Baker assured then-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that the NATO alliance would not expand 'one inch eastward' beyond the borders of a reunified Germany following the annexation of the German Democratic Republic by the Federal Republic.

""A special border operation was coordinated for a future response to a possible complication of the situation jointly with interacting state structures and a corresponding plan was worked out,"" the press service quoted him as saying on the agency’s website. According to the official, the threat of a migration crisis and the possibility of a migrant influx into the country remain on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border. He specified that the main task of those participating in the special operation is to prevent any illegal migrants from penetrating into Ukraine. According to him, in order to do so, the coordination of all participating agencies - the State Border Guard Service, the National Guard, the police, the armed forces and others - was ensured. During the special operation, plans are in store to use aviation, including drones, for patrols. Additionally, it involves a substantial tightening of the border regime on the Ukrainian-Belarusian sector. Checkpoints will be set up on motorways in border districts, bus and railway stations will be inspected and preventive measures will be undertaken in populated localities near the border, the press service specified.

This contrasts sharply with reports in the US media of a continued Russian buildup in Belarus and on its Western frontier. Following the removal of most US Embassy staff from the Ukrainian capital of Kiev late last month, the US State Department has announced it is moving its embassy in Ukraine to the western city of Lvov. According to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the shift is motivated by Washington's fears that Russia is planning to soon invade Ukraine, despite assurances otherwise from both Kiev and Moscow. ""With that in mind, we are in the process of temporarily relocating our Embassy operations in Ukraine from our Embassy in Kiev to Lvov due to the dramatic acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces"", Blinken said. ""The Embassy will remain engaged with the Ukrainian government, coordinating diplomatic engagement in Ukraine"". ""These prudent precautions in no way undermine our support for or our commitment to Ukraine"", the US secretary of state added. ""Our commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity is unwavering"". The US already maintains a consulate in Lvov, which is close to Ukraine's western border with Poland. A State Department official denied over the weekend that the Lvov consulate was a ""fallback"" position or even that the Kiev embassy would close. ""We're shifting some people there in part because of its closer proximity to US diplomatic and consular facilities in neighbouring countries so we can maintain close coordination with colleagues in those neighbouring countries and ensure that, should military action on the part of Russia begin, we can move those people safely should we decide to do so"", the official told reporters. Still, according to The Wall Street Journal on Monday, when US workers left the Kiev embassy on Monday, the State Department ""ordered the destruction of networking equipment and computer workstations and the dismantling of the embassy telephone system"", rendering the ""embassy inoperable as a diplomatic facility"". The report was based on internal documents viewed by the New York paper. The US has claimed for months that Russian troops engaged in military drills in Russia's southwestern regions are preparing to invade Ukraine, offering a variety of claims for which it has never furnished proof and scolded journalists who sought it. Moscow says its troops are no threat - something the Ukrainian government has agreed with, urging the US to stop spreading invasion panic. In order to defuse the situation, the administration of Russian President Vladimir Putin has informed NATO of its primary security concerns, including that the alliance halt its eastward expansion and pledge not to accept Ukraine as a member or station offensive weapons on Ukrainian soil. On Monday, Kiev seemed to indicate a willingness to consider giving up on its NATO membership ambitions, but that was quickly squashed. NATO has likewise indicated a willingness to discuss issues relating to its stationing of certain weapons in Eastern Europe, such as at the Aegis Ashore bases in Poland and Romania, but refused to close its ""open-door"" membership policy.",russian,1,530,94.49,66.66,47.21,15.97,29.44,33.96,79.25,54.91,46.23,8.11,3.02,0,2.64,0,0,0.19,5.09,14.53,8.11,0.19,16.98,5.09,2.08,4.53,0.75,9.06,3.77,1.89,11.89,4.91,0.94,6.42,7.92,0.75,7.17,1.32,1.13,0.94,0.94,0.19,2.64,0,1.89,0.75,1.13,0.57,0,0.57,0.38,0.19,0,0,10.38,5.09,0.38,0.57,1.32,0.19,1.51,5.28,0,0,0,0,9.25,6.98,1.89,0.38,4.53,0.19,0.57,3.77,0,0,0.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.19,0,0.19,0,0,0.38,0,1.89,10.94,0.75,0.75,9.43,0,0,0,4.53,3.21,3.58,0.94,0,0,0,0,0,12.64,3.4,4.53,0,0,0.94,3.77

The officer made the remarks amid claims by US officials and media that Russia is poised for an invasion of Ukraine. Moscow has denied the allegations. Britain could deploy up to 600 elite Special Air Service (SAS), Parachute Regiment troops and support forces to Ukraine, The Mirror reports, citing a source said to be familiar with the preparations. “The high readiness element of the brigade was told it may need to deploy at very short notice. Between 400 and 600 troops are ready. Their equipment is packed and they are ready to fly to Ukraine and either land or parachute in. They have trained for both eventualities,” the anonymous source said. Plans for the possible deployment were drawn up following apparent warnings by Britain’s defence establishment and MI6 warning of a supposed ‘clear and present danger’ posed by Russia to Ukraine – an aspiring NATO partner. Two thirds of the British force is said to consist of paratroopers from the 16 Air Assault Brigade, ordinarily based in Aldershot, southern England. Along with SAS and paratroops, the unit is also said to include medics, engineers, signallers and other support staff. It’s not clear exactly where in Ukraine British troops would be sent, or what their purpose could be. The UK and its NATO allies have already rotated deployments of hundreds of troops in and out of western Ukraine in recent years to train troops, and to parade through the streets of Kiev, Ukraine’s capital, in a show of force to Moscow. NATO has also provided the country with billions of dollars in lethal weapons.  Russian officials have slammed the deployments and arms deliveries, pointing to Kiev’s ongoing military campaign against separatist forces in the country’s east, and to the danger of a further destabilisation of the situation. Ukraine was thrust into a civil war in the spring of 2014, in the aftermath of a US and EU-backed coup d’état which ousted the country’s democratically elected president and brought ultra-nationalists to power. The violence caused the deaths of over 13,000 people, with over 2.5 million forced to flee their homes, and nearly a million settling in neighbouring Russia as refugees. Britain deployed a “small team” of army Royal Engineers to Poland’s border with Belarus this week amid tensions between Warsaw and Minsk over Middle Eastern migrants seeking to make their way into the European Union using Belarus as a transit point. Poland has built up troops, tanks, and aircraft on the border against thousands of unarmed migrants. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko called the deployment “blackmail,” pointing to the absurdity of Poland’s alleged plans to fight “migrants with Leopard tanks.” ‘Russian Invasion’ Fears US and UK media have spent the past two weeks accusing Russia of concentrating forces “on the border with Ukraine,” with Politico publishing satellite pictures of Russian armoured units in Smolensk region –which is over 250 km north of the Ukrainian border, as a border buildup. The claims have been echoed by the Washington Post and Foreign Policy. Moscow dismissed the reports as a coordinated fake news campaign against Russia. On Wednesday, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby asked Russia to provide the US with more information about the supposed buildup, while Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Moscow against making “mistakes” in Ukraine. The Russian Foreign Ministry blasted Blinken over the remarks, urging Washington to consider its own conduct in Ukraine, including its support for the illegal February 2014 coup. On Saturday, UK Chief of Defence Staff Nick Carter warned in an interview that the risk of an accidental war between the West and Russia was greater now than at any other time in his 44-year career. “I think the nature of the competition between states and great powers leads to greater tensions. We have to be careful that people don’t end up allowing the bellicose nature of some of our politics to end up in a position where escalation leads to miscalculation,” Carter stressed. The ‘Ukraine invasion claims’ have been accompanied by active diplomatic efforts by Ukraine to join the NATO alliance. Russia has expressed concerns over the prospects of Ukraine becoming part of the Western bloc. Despite a commitment to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990 not to expand eastward beyond the borders of a reunified Germany, NATO has gone on to swallow up every single former member of the Warsaw Pact alliance, plus three former Soviet republics, and four republics of the former Yugoslavia. Along with Ukraine, Georgia has also applied for membership in NATO. Despite its claims of being a defensive alliance, NATO has spent much of the past thirty years focused on external operations, including the 1990s bombing of Yugoslavia, turning Libya into a failed state in 2011, and the 19+ year occupation of Afghanistan which ended in August with the withdrawal of Western troops and the collapse of the Afghan army and government.",russian,1,842,99,54.24,35.23,4.48,25.52,29.69,81.47,56.41,45.37,3.56,1.66,0.12,0.59,0,0.24,0.71,1.9,14.13,9.5,3.21,19.83,4.63,1.54,4.87,0.36,9.62,5.58,3.09,9.74,3.09,1.07,6.06,8.08,0.12,7.96,0.83,2.26,0.59,1.19,0.24,2.73,0,3.68,0.83,2.85,0.36,0,0.36,0.24,0.12,0,0,9.86,5.46,1.19,0.12,0.48,0.36,2.14,4.99,0,0,0,0.36,6.65,4.63,1.78,0.24,2.97,0,0.24,2.38,0.36,0,0.71,0.24,0,0,0,0,0,0.12,0.24,0.36,0,0.12,0,0,0,0,1.31,0,2.61,11.88,0.95,0.95,9.38,0.24,0.12,0.24,2.85,4.16,2.38,1.07,0,0,0,0,0,12.95,4.04,4.51,0,0,1.54,2.85

Ukrainian troops practiced urban combat and other tactics in the northern city of Pripyat on Friday, according to AFP. Due to many unique characteristics of the area, it offered a unique training opportunity. However, it’s also very dangerous, as the city lies within the fallout zone irradiated by the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, when a nearby nuclear power plant experienced a partial meltdown during a safety test. ""As there are no civilians around here we can conduct exercises with real ammunition in a situation as close to actual urban warfare as possible,"" one Ukrainian soldier told AFP. According to the agency, the troops practiced clearing buildings of enemy troops, targeted mortar fire and engaging snipers in urban conditions. Emergency service workers also practiced evacuations and firefighting. Photos of the drills show troops in snow gear maneuvering down streets and through wooded areas, and the erection of “hedgehog” tank traps and concertina wire. Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov, who was accompanied by journalists to the Exclusion Zone, downplayed the threat posed by Russian soldiers, but described the Exclusion Zone as a major obstacle, with radiation forming just one peril. ""This area is very hard to get through - forests, swamp, rivers - it's complicated enough to move by foot, let alone with a tank,"" Reznikov said. ""And don't forget that still since the disaster, there remain some highly radioactive areas on the route from Belarus."" Civilians generally aren’t allowed in the exclusion zone, where some of the worst radiation spewed by the fire inside of Chernobyl Reactor No. 4 fell and irradiated the soil. The area covers some 1,000 square kilometers and abuts the Belarusian border. Pripyat, which at the time had 50,000 people, many of whom were employed at the nuclear power plant, was evacuated after the April 1986 incident, along with numerous other towns in the area. Since then, it’s become an eerie ghost city, and the surrounding countryside has been studied by naturalists fascinated with what happens when all human interaction halts. A New Safe Containment Shelter has also been erected over the collapsed fourth reactor to halt further radioactive leaking - a task it’s expected to perform for the next century. Kiev deployed several thousand troops to the area beginning in November, when the West began raising fears of alleged Russian invasion plans after Russian troops were deployed near the Ukrainian border. If an attack were to come from Belarus, the Exclusion Zone offers one of the quickest ways to the capital of Kiev. Moscow has denied plans for an invasion, and troops deployed to Belarus are scheduled for combined drills later this month. Indeed, Kiev has also sought to play down Western fears, saying the Russian forces near the border aren’t numerous enough to constitute an invasion force, and that such deployments are both legal and typical. As a way to defuse the crisis, Moscow has made a security proposal that would protect its western flank, asking NATO not to expand further eastward, including refusing to admit Ukraine as a future member of the alliance. Moscow has also demanded that no offensive forces be stationed by NATO in Ukraine. So far, the alliance has refused to write off the possibility of admitting Ukraine, but has made some concessions about stationing offensive weapons in Ukraine or certain other weapons in nearby states. However, the US has demanded Russia pull its troops back from near the Ukrainian border, putting the entire blame for the crisis on Russia’s shoulders.",russian,1,616,95.74,34.51,71.6,3.56,24.64,28.41,81.33,56.98,46.1,3.08,0.49,0,0.16,0,0,0,2.6,15.91,10.55,1.79,16.23,5.52,3.9,6.98,1.14,9.42,8.6,3.9,7.47,2.27,0.97,4.22,8.28,0.65,7.63,0.97,1.46,0.32,1.14,0.32,3.41,0.16,4.55,1.14,3.41,0.81,0,0.81,0.49,0.32,0,0,7.31,3.73,0.49,0,1.14,0.49,0.97,3.41,0,0,0,0,3.25,0.97,1.95,0.32,2.92,0.32,0,2.6,0,0,0.65,0,0,0,0,0,0.16,0,0.16,0.49,0,0.16,0,0.32,0,0.16,1.79,0.32,2.11,13.8,0.32,0.97,12.34,0.16,0,0.32,3.9,3.9,4.06,0.97,0,0,0,0,0,13.96,4.06,6.82,0,0,1.3,1.79

""Russia has used energy as a tool for political influence (see for instance in Moldova), and while it is strictly speaking fulfilling its commitments on gas supplies, many see its current refusal to increase export volumes to Europe or to re-fill Gazprom-owned storage facilities as a means to exert pressure on the EU and specifically to secure the regulatory licensing of Nord Stream 2,"" Borrell said on his blog on Sunday. He pointed out that European energy prices have been extraordinarily high and have risen by around 300 percent since this summer and by 40 percent this month alone. In such circumstances, the political discourse involving Ukraine is inevitably linked to the issue of gas imports, Borrell said. ""Any discussion on Russia/Ukraine/Belarus includes the energy dimension, given that 40% of EU gas imports come from Russia, principally through three transit routes: Ukraine, Belarus and the Baltic Sea,"" Borrell explained. Nord Stream 2 is a joint venture of Gazprom, Royal Dutch Shell, OMV, Engie, Uniper, and Wintershall. The project is designed to carry natural gas from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea. The pipeline was completed in September and is now undergoing certification in Germany, which has been stalled by the Federal Network Agency's demand to create a German subsidiary and then file a separate bid on its behalf. According to the German energy regulator, the decision on Nord Stream 2 certification will not be made in the first half of 2022. The new German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said earlier this month that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline could not be permitted in its current form because it did not comply with EU law. The declaration led to a sharp rise in European gas prices. Russia's permanent representative to the EU Vladimir Chizhov said last week that the decision to extend the certification period for Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is political as there is no logical reason for it.",russian,1,353,94.49,30.59,19.16,20.23,29.42,28.33,70.54,56.09,41.36,5.1,0.57,0,0,0,0.57,0,4.53,13.31,7.93,3.4,15.01,5.67,1.98,4.53,1.13,11.33,6.52,3.68,6.52,0,1.98,4.53,7.37,0.28,7.08,1.7,2.55,0.57,0.57,0,1.7,0,0.57,0.28,0.28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.67,4.25,0,0,0.28,0,2.55,1.13,0,0,0,0.57,4.82,2.83,1.7,0.28,2.55,0,0,1.98,0.57,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.57,0,0,0.28,0.28,2.55,6.52,0.57,1.42,4.25,0.57,0,0,5.38,4.53,4.25,0.28,0,0,0,0,0,13.31,3.4,5.1,0,0,0.57,4.25

French President Emmanuel Macron stated on Tuesday that his meeting with Putin helped to avoid escalation over Ukraine, adding, however, that he never thought ""for one second"" that the Russian president was ""prepared to make any gestures"" on the issue. ""For me, it was about 'locking the game' in order to prevent an escalation and open up new prospects. For me, this goal has been achieved. France has strengthened its credibility"", Macron said, as quoted by the BFMTV broadcaster. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov addressed the Monday talks, noting that Western countries have not yet shown any readiness to take Russia's security concerns into account. During the meeting, Putin expressed regret that the responses of the US and NATO to Russia's security proposals are secondary and do not address fundamental issues. Therefore, the topic remains open, Peskov told the press. At the same time, the spokesman denied a Financial Times report about an alleged deal reached by the two presidents during the talks. The outlet suggested that Putin and Macron had agreed on a broader dialogue on the movement of Russian troops and possibly their withdrawal from Belarus after the completion of joint drills later in February. ""Well, here, of course, what the Financial Times has reported is probably wrong, because, in the current situation, Moscow and Paris could not strike any deals. It is simply impossible since France is both a member of the EU and the EU presidency. France is also a member of NATO, where France does not own leadership"", Peskov said. Tensions over Ukraine have been escalating over the past weeks, as the US, the United Kingdom, and their allies have claimed Russia is planning ""an invasion"" of the neighbouring country, citing the movement of troops on the border.

Konashenkov added that on Thursday, ""military echelons with heavy military equipment of the units of the Southern Military District, who drilled tasks at training grounds in the Crimea, were transferred by rail over a distance of more than 1,500 kilometres to permanent deployment bases in the Chechen Republic and the Republic of Dagestan"". According to him, also returning to their permanent bases are Russian units who have wrapped up their exercises in Belarus. The remarks come a few days after Konashenkov told reporters that Russia's southern and western military units had started the process of returning troops to their places of permanent deployment after the drills. He spoke as the Russian Defence Ministry published a video of the military vehicles being loaded for return to their permanent bases. The vehicles included includes tanks, AMPVs, as well as self-propelled howitzers. The ministry also posted a clip showing Т-72Bz tanks leaving the site of the drills. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, for his part, commented on the redeployment of troops by saying that it is a regular troop movement, and there is ""nothing new"" in it. On Monday, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said during a meeting with President Vladimir Putin that the Russian military is conducting a number of exercises, and that some of them have already wrapped up, while other drills are close to completion. The developments come amid ongoing Western media reports that Russia is amassing troops at the border, planning an ""imminent invasion"" of Ukraine. Moscow has rejected the allegations as absurd, stressing that the whole ""invasion"" narrative is a pretext for NATO to deploy more troops close to the Russian border.",russian,1,373,97.85,68.26,62.26,23.62,28.69,34.58,76.41,57.64,45.04,6.97,3.75,0,0,0,1.07,2.14,3.22,17.16,10.72,1.07,17.69,4.29,1.61,5.09,0.27,9.65,6.97,4.29,5.9,1.61,0.27,4.02,2.41,0.27,1.61,0.27,0,0,0,0,1.34,0,1.34,0.8,0.54,0.27,0,0.27,0.27,0,0,0,10.19,4.29,0.27,0,0.27,0.27,3.22,6.43,0,0,0,1.61,5.36,3.75,1.61,0,2.41,0,0,2.41,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.27,0,0.54,0,0,0,0,2.14,12.33,0,2.95,10.46,0.27,0,0.27,5.9,4.56,2.68,0.8,0,0,0,0,0,12.6,3.49,5.36,0,0,0.54,3.22

Kiev needs to sit down at the negotiating table with leaders of the self-proclaimed Donbass republics and agree the measures needed to resolve the conflict, and the sooner it does so, the better, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said. ""The Belarusian president and I stated that the guarantee to restoring peace in Ukraine and relieving tension around this country lies with the implementation of the Minsk Agreements,"" Putin said, speaking to reporters after his talks with President Alexander Lukashenko on Friday. ""All Kiev needs to do is sit down at the negotiating table with representatives of the Donbass and agree on political, military, economic and humanitarian measures to end this conflict. The sooner this happens, the better,"" Putin added. The Russian president lamented that unfortunately, at the moment, ""we are witnessing, on the contrary, an aggravation of the situation in the Donbass."" ""The settlement process is still stalled. Despite all our efforts and contacts at the level of advisors to the leaders of the Normandy format countries [Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France], our consultations on this issue with partners have not helped,"" Putin said. Kiev, the Russian president suggested, is refusing to comply with the Minsk agreements and categorically rejecting direct dialogue with the self-proclaimed republics. ""Kiev is essentially sabotaging the implementation of the agreements to amend the constitution, regarding the special status of the Donbass, local elections and amnesty,"" Putin said. Commenting on the growing tensions between Russia and the West over Ukraine, Alexander Lukashenko accused Western politicians of behaving in a ""stupid"" and dangerous manner. ""For the first time in decades, we have found ourselves on the verge of a conflict that could swallow up almost the entire continent like a funnel. Today we see in all its glory the irresponsibility, and pardon the frankness, stupidity of a number of Western politicians, which defies logic; we see behaviour of the leaders of regional countries which defies logic or reasonable explanation, their downright painful desire to walk along the very edge of conflict,"" the Belarusian leader said. Donbass Escalation Friday's meeting between Putin and Lukashenko comes at the conclusion of a tension-filled week, with the prediction by Western officials and media that Moscow would begin an ""invasion"" of Ukraine on Wednesday proven false, and the Biden administration and the outlets whose stories were debunked adjusting their claims to suggest that an incursion will actually start after the 20th of February. Moscow has repeatedly dismissed the invasion claims as a pretext for NATO to beef up its military footprint in countries surrounding Russia. The past 48 hours have also seen a dramatic escalation in back-and-forth claims by Kiev and the Donbass breakaways accusing one another of sniper fire and shelling using artillery, mortars and anti-tank weapons systems, with the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics and the Ukrainian Army reporting dozens of incidents on a daily basis. On Friday, Donetsk People's Republics chief Denis Pushilin urged residents to begin evacuating to Russia, citing the threat of a Ukrainian invasion and constant shelling by Ukrainian forces. Leonid Pasechnik, the head of the Lugansk People's Republic, similarly called on people not involved in maintaining critical social and civilian infrastructure to leave, and asked all men of fighting age to remain behind and take up arms to defend the republic. In addition to Ukrainian regular armed forces formations, the Donbass is known to be filled with neo-Nazi volunteer militias, as well as foreign mercenaries from countries including Poland and Britain. Last week, Donbass militias spotted Ukrainian S-300s, heavy artillery and foreign mercenaries operating near the front line and warned of the dangers of an imminent provocation. Signed in February 2015 after months of bloody fighting between Kiev forces and Donbass militias, the Minsk Agreements instituted a ceasefire in the region and compelled both sides to pull heavy weaponry back from the front lines. The peace deal, which provides Kiev with a means to return Donetsk and Lugansk to its jurisdiction in exchange for broad constitutionally guaranteed autonomy, succeeded in stopping mass bloodshed but has been stalled amid accusations of violations of the ceasefire, and by Ukrainian leaders' refusal to implement its political portion. The war in the Donbass began in the spring of 2014 after Kiev sent troops to try to crush fledgling independence movements which sprang up in the aftermath of the February 2014 coup in Kiev, which replaced the country's democratically elected president with a pro-US, pro-EU and pro-NATO junta.",russian,1,781,99,54.57,35.04,4.36,33.96,34.06,79.26,55.95,44.3,4.1,1.54,0.13,0.9,0,0.13,0.26,2.56,15.36,11.52,1.66,18.44,2.69,1.41,5.89,0.26,8.19,4.87,3.07,8.71,1.28,1.02,6.53,6.66,0.51,6.15,1.41,1.02,0.9,0.26,0.64,1.79,0,5.25,1.54,3.59,0.51,0,0.38,0,0.13,0,0.13,10.88,6.79,0.51,0.26,2.05,0.64,2.82,3.84,0,0,0,0.26,5.38,3.84,1.54,0,2.43,0,0.13,2.18,0.13,0,0.77,0.13,0.13,0,0,0,0,0.26,0.13,0.64,0.13,0.13,0,0.13,0,0.26,0.77,0,2.3,10.24,0.13,0.77,8.32,0.51,0,0.77,4.61,3.07,2.3,0.77,0.26,0,0.26,0,0,14.08,2.94,6.4,0,0,0.9,3.84

Speaking about what his country has been doing to defend itself amid unstable and tense relations with the EU and NATO's reported plans for eastward expansion, Lukashenko mentioned what Minsk needs. ""Today we completely cover our borders with our air defence systems ... But in order to be effective against a missile attack, we need just the S-400, and maybe the S-500 [air defence systems],"" Lukashenko said. When asked when Belarus could receive these defence missile systems, Lukashenko said that Russian President Vladimir Putin would make that decision. Lukashenko also mentioned that Belarus already has a combat-ready S-400 system in its training centre, and Minsk wants to ask Moscow to leave it in Belarus. Lukashenko added that all launchers for nuclear intercontinental missiles in Belarus have been preserved and are ready for use, except for one. ""Why did I become an enemy for the West? Not because I am a dictator. Because all the sites on which Topol [missiles] stood, except one, are completely preserved and are still ready for use,"" Lukashenko said. According to Lukashenko, former Russian President Boris Yeltsin sought to destroy these launching facilities due to pressure from Washington. ""I said no. But when the pressure was extreme so that you know, I can prove and show it, we blew up one site, it was in the forest, the sites are not just 10 centimetres there, it is very big [area],"" Lukashenko said. On Tensions Between Russia and Ukraine According to Lukashenko, Putin offered to former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko assistance in the restoration of Donbass, but Poroshenko refused due to external influence. ""And Putin wholeheartedly says: well, what they are doing, we need to finish this … It [the war] should end and Donbass must be restored. People need to live normally... I say, if it's official, I'm ready to talk with Poroshenko on this topic … I was already leaving, he [Putin] took me by the hand: and [said] I will help to restore Donbass. And I will help, tell him [Poroshenko],"" Lukashenko said.The Belarusian president mentioned that he had good relations with Poroshenko and knew him before he became the president of Ukraine.""I suggest you restore Donbass. Putin told me about it directly. I emphasize this. You know, Poroshenko finally agreed. But after a month, within a month, he began to do everything the other way around. Why? Because the guy was under external control,"" Lukashenko said. He also asserted that he had offered to place Belarusian border guards on the border with Russia and Ukraine, adding that Moscow did not mind, but Kiev had refused. ""When Putin and I once again talked, you know, when the OSCE sent these observers, I say: you know, I've seen enough observers in my life. Nothing will come of them, they will play on the side of the West. He says: well, okay. They want, let there be these observers. Well, what option is this? Therefore, for me, it is more than clear what is happening in Ukraine and what is the way out in this situation. Well, they did not use this way out then, including that I was even ready to deploy my border guards on 400 kilometres of the Ukrainian-Russian border,"" he said. According to Lukashenko, he was ready to close the border.""When Putin came to Minsk, we discussed this problem. You, he says, take such a neutral position. I do not mind. But Ukraine opposed. That is, any normal initiatives were torpedoed. Okay, you didn’t trust Lukashenko then. Now I understand, now Lukashenko is Putin's lackey, as they say. But then he occupied a neutral position, as you say,"" the Belarusian president stated.Ukraine torpedoed all initiatives because, in Lukashenko's words, ""they did not rule their country then, and even more so now"". On Crimea According to Lukashenko, before the change of power in Kiev, the Ukrainian military offered to their colleagues from Russia the opportunity to save Crimea from a NATO invasion in 2014, which was reported to Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""They [Ukrainian military] reached out to Russian [military] ... They warned the Russians that Crimea will not be Russia's if we do not take certain actions. It will not be Ukraine's either. And whose? — NATO's ... And after the next meeting with the Russians ... they suggested ... that the issue of Crimea is necessary to be decided. According to my information, it was reported to the Russian president,"" Lukashenko said. According to the Ukrainian military serving in Crimea, the US had already designed barracks in Sevastopol, the Belarusian president added.""Therefore, those who served there in Crimea, they saw it, Ukrainian, former Soviet generals and officers. And they offered Russians ... And, according to my information, the president insisted on a legal solution to the problem. He was absolutely in favour of it. I know Putin's position — in no case should there be NATO troops in Crimea,"" the Belarusian president said.He said that ""therefore, there was not a single shot [in Crimea]."" ""Because it was agreed in advance that Crimea should be saved, and then, as I know and understand, Putin insisted on a referendum,"" he said. According to Lukashenko, the referendum has legally reunited Crimea with Russia. On Migrant Crisis on the Border With Poland Smuggling weapons from Ukraine intended for migrants at the Belarusian border, activities stopped by the Belarusian security service, started long before the migration crisis, Lukashenko told Ria Novosti, adding that the goal was to use these arms against himself, as well as a Russian military base and reporters. ""We noticed this, I think, three weeks ago, and began to record even earlier. This is arms traffic already coming from Ukraine, this is a disaster,"" Lukashenko claimed.The purpose of these weapons was ""to eliminate the president and commit terrorist acts on the territory of Belarus,"" he added. ""We prevented [the use of weapons] against the Russian military base, we showed it, against our journalists, against your [RT] journalist Konstantin Pridybailo ...The organizers were ... Americans and Belarusians who were detained in Moscow,"" Lukashenko asserted. Russian citizens, including Chechens, were among the organizers of the delivery of Middle Eastern migrants to the Belarusian border, Lukashenko continued. ""These people [refugees] hire private traders, 300-350 kilometers, and they are on the border near Brest and Grodno. Private companies, then taxis, buses ... But, guides from Russia worked here, and thanks to the Chechens. What an organized people. They were the most organized here, organizing the flow,"" he said. He also pointed out that the European Union had terminated the readmission agreement with Belarus.""I said directly, well, you tore up this agreement, you stopped cooperating with us and talking on border issues, well, God be with you. Your problems, but I tell you, I will not protect you anymore like I did last year. They all hear it, and the organizers as well,"" Lukashenko said. Acting German Chancellor Angela Merkel in phone conversations earlier promised Belarus EU assistance to solve the problem of refugees in a camp on the Polish-Belarusian border. ""Those [of the Iraqi refugees at the border] who have already worn out, we worked with them and sent them to Iraq. I fulfill my promise, which I gave to the European Union through Merkel. They did not take a single step, although Merkel promised me that the issue of this camp, these 2,000 migrants, will be decided by the European Union, together with us,"" Lukashenko said on the essence of his negotiations with Merkel. According to him, ""this is already a big step forward.""""They [the EU] didn’t talk about it at all, and now they will decide,"" the Belarusian president continued.""Why are migrants sitting there? They are waiting to be taken away,"" Lukashenko said.

The mission of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) to the Joint Centre of Control and Coordination (JCCC) has said that Ukrainian forces shelled the outskirts of the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk on Thursday. ""At 9:50 [06:50 GMT], shelling was recorded from the side of the armed formations of Ukraine in the direction of the village of Mandrykino [outskirts of Donetsk]. Five 82-mm calibre mines were fired"", a DPR spokesperson told reporters. The remarks followed the militia of the Lugansk People's Republic (LPR) in eastern Ukraine stating that the situation in the region has worsened considerably in the past 24 hours as Kiev is trying to escalate the conflict. The LPR called on international observers to record the attack and take measures to prevent aggression by Ukraine. ""Ukraine's armed units grossly violated the ceasefire regime, using weapons that, in accordance with the Minsk [peace] agreements, should be withdrawn"", an officer from the LPR mission to the JCCC said. The DPR's militia, in turn, said on Thursday that its units had retaliated against the Ukrainian security forces, who shelled the territory of the self-proclaimed republic. ""In order to protect the civilian population, our defenders were forced to return fire to suppress the enemy's firepower. Information on civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure is being clarified"", the militia's spokesman said. The DPR militia also claimed that the Ukrainian Army is planning an amphibious assault operation in the Donetsk region in the hope of capturing the Sea of Azov coastline. ""The command of the Vostok [East] Tactical Operations Group […] is preparing an amphibious assault landing to seize the Sea of Azov coast in the Donetsk People's Republic and use it as a springboard for an offensive on our rear positions"", a militia spokesperson told reporters. They argued that the assault will target the villages of Sartana and Kominternovo east of the key port city of Mariupol, and that the Ukrainian forces would use American landing ships in the operation. DPR intelligence has, meanwhile, reported about preparations for the evacuation of the Ukrainian president's office and the country's parliament to the western city of Lvov in connection with the hostilities. Donbass Conflict The conflict in Ukraine began in 2014, when the Ukrainian Army launched an offensive against the eastern regions of Donetsk and Lugansk, referred to together as Donbass, after they proclaimed independence from Kiev. Their decision came in response to what they considered a coup in Kiev that toppled the old government in February of that year. In February 2015, the leaders of the so-called Normandy Four, which besides Ukraine includes France, Germany, and Russia, held talks in the Belarusian capital Minsk that resulted in adopting peace agreements aimed at halting the war in Donbass and a long-term political settlement of the conflict. During a Normandy Format summit in Paris in late 2019, all sides agreed that the Minsk agreements remain the basis for the resolution of the crisis. In one of the latest developments, Russian President Vladimir Putin stressed that the Minsk agreements remain the only possible solution to the Ukraine conflict, but Kiev does not want to fulfill them. According to Putin, Ukraine has been dragging out negotiations to resolve the conflict, and against this backdrop, NATO has been deploying military equipment closer to the border with Russia.",russian,1,587,99,60.33,39.78,1.11,29.35,35.26,79.22,52.47,43.95,4.43,1.36,0,0.34,0,0,0.85,3.07,18.06,14.31,2.04,17.55,3.92,1.19,3.24,0.17,8.35,3.58,1.02,7.84,0.51,1.02,6.3,6.98,0.51,6.47,1.53,1.87,1.02,0.34,0,1.36,0,4.77,0.68,4.09,1.19,0.17,1.02,0.17,0.85,0,0,11.58,6.98,0.17,0,3.07,0.34,3.24,4.6,0,0,0,0.17,5.79,4.09,1.7,0,1.7,0,0,1.7,0,0,0.17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.17,0.17,0.34,0.17,0,0.17,0,0,0.85,0,0.85,11.24,0,1.36,10.05,0,0,0,3.41,4.43,2.39,0.85,0,0,0,0,0,16.18,3.58,5.28,0,0,1.7,5.62

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko’s statement on Crimea at the meeting of the Supreme State Council of the Union State of Russia and Belarus means recognizing it as part of Russia, Belarusian MP Andrei Savinyh said on Thursday. ""Beyond all doubt,"" Savinyh, who chairs the permanent commission for international affairs at the House of Representatives (lower house of the Belarusian parliament) told YouTube channel Solovyov Live. The lawmaker stressed that Belarus had considered Crimea as Russia’s territory for a long time, but this was not ""formalized for Russia’s media space."" ""Nevertheless, several times and the president’s statement was that this (Crimea as part of Russia - TASS) is a political reality. Today it was unequivocally announced, and for us, Crimea, as well as, let’s say, a month ago, is and was an integral part of the Russian Federation,"" the lawmaker added. Lukashenko ""complained"" to Putin earlier in the day at a video conference of the Supreme Council of the Union State that he had not been invited to Sevastopol to mark Russia’s National Unity Day, although Putin ""used to promise me that he would bring me along to Crimea."" In response, Putin told Lukashenko about the monument to victims of the Russian Civil War (1917-1922) in Crimea and assured that he would always be delighted to welcome the Belarusian president in the peninsula. After a government coup in Ukraine in February 2014 the authorities of Crimea and Sevastopol made a decision to hold a referendum on reunification with Russia. In the voting held on March 16 more than 80% of those eligible to cast their ballots took part. The unification with Russia was supported by 96.7% and 95.6% in Crimea and Sevastopol respectively. On March 18, the Russian president signed a treaty on the accession of the Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol to the Russian Federation.

At the same time, the procedures for obtaining a residence permit and a temporary residence permit have been simplified for a number of categories, administrative barriers have been removed, including a reduction in the time for processing applications.

Who is to blame and what's the solution to the unfolding chaos? Poland has rushed to pin the blame on Belarus and Russia for what it called facilitating illegal migration to destabilise the EU. Still, Minsk and Moscow dismissed Warsaw's accusation as completely false. The Belarusian leadership has explained that it has no funds to stop the refugee influx due to the European sanctions spree. Meanwhile, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Wednesday called for fresh sanctions on ""all those who participate in the targeted smuggling of migrants"", including Minsk. On the same day, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and US President Joe Biden discussed potentially imposing restrictions against airlines carrying the refugees. A day earlier, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg reassured Poland of the alliance’s solidarity with Warsaw amid the border crisis. Migrant Influx: Chickens Coming Home to Roost ""Biden and von der Leyen addressed the humanitarian situation on the EU’s border with Belarus and expressed 'deep concern about the irregular migration flows'. Still, there was no discussion about the impact of the US and NATO occupation of Afghanistan that lasted for almost 20 years"", highlights Adriel Kasonta, a London-based foreign affairs analyst and former chairman of the International Affairs Committee at Bow Group, a conservative think tank in the UK. The unfolding blame game is not helping at all; in fact, ""it’s made by design to protect the real perpetrators of yet another migrant and humanitarian crisis at our borders, namely, the United States of America and their European vassals"", according to the scholar. ""I’m pretty astonished by the fact that European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who has recently met with Joe Biden in Washington, failed to address the root cause of the migrant flow from the Middle East, namely, the US presence in the region and its destabilisation"", Kasonta notes, adding that he does not believe Belarus should be the guardian of the EU's borders and keep migrants inside its own country. Moscow is Major Target of US-EU Blame Game It appears that the root of the unfolding controversy lies in the EU's antagonism towards the government of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, deems Eurasia Centre Vice President Earl Rasmussen. ""The disintegration took a major downward step following the Ryanair incident but also to some degree as a result of EU countries supporting the overthrow of the Belarusian government and the anti-Lukashenko demonstrations following the Belarusian election"", the think tank vice president says. ""The EU is attempting to show strength but seems to only know the language military actions or sanctions as a means for diplomacy"". At the same time, Rasmussen does not rule out that the real target for the EU-US' blame game is Russia, Belarus' longstanding ally. By tightening the screws on Minsk, Brussels and Washington are seeking to oust the government of Lukashenko in order to replace him with a pro-Western leader and pull Minsk away from Moscow, according to the scholar. ""Instead of trying to de-escalate tensions and help people who are trapped in these inhumane conditions, we can see an intensifying blame game and Poland (most probably encouraged by the US that is now telling the EU that Russia plans to invade Ukraine) doing what Poland does best: acts as a useful idiot in Washington’s arsenal against Moscow"", echoes Kasonta. No Unity Within the European Bloc Meanwhile, the EU and Poland's position is weakened by the fact that there's no unity between the two, Rasmussen presumes. ""As many know, there are tensions between the EU leadership and Poland"", the scholar says. ""Moreover, there seems to be little support that the EU is providing to Poland, hence the actions taken"". Euronews reported on 12 November that while Warsaw is depicting itself as a ""defender"" of ""Christian Europe"" against migrant ""invaders"", it has ignored the European Court of Human Rights' order to provide food and medical care to a group of Afghan refugees stranded on its border for weeks. The media outlet also notes that Poland has rejected Germany's repeated offers for assistance with border protection, and has not allowed EU border agency Frontex to be present at the border. Earlier, Poland along with Hungary, Slovakia, and Czech Republic vehemently opposed the EU's migrant ""quotas."" ""Poland is very selective about migrants. They don’t like Muslims, Arabs, Indians, and Blacks"", remarks Kasonta, adding that Warsaw is at the same time allowing Belarusians into the country"". When it comes to NATO's potential interference in the border crisis, it is highly unlikely, despite encouraging signals from Stoltenberg, according to Rasmussen: ""This is definitely outside of NATO mission area"", the scholar stresses. Spectre of 2015 Refugee Crisis While the blame game is raging on, the unfolding border tensions evoke strong memories of the refugee crisis which engulfed Europe in 2015, according to the observers. ""The fear of a 2015 migrant crisis repeat becomes a reality"", believes Adriel Kasonta. ""Nevertheless, there is a difference between the 2015 crisis and the current one, as the latter has added geopolitical dimensions because it is unfolding on the border between NATO and Russia-allied Belarus. Perhaps the recent antagonisation of Belarus and Russia serves as a tool to maintain the cohesion within the EU, which is mentally preparing for the coming crisis and needs the unifier – a topic that allows them to stick together in times when they would normally disunite"". Kasonta believes that the UN Security Council has to step in to solve the emerging problem, as neither the EU – including Poland – nor the US can be trusted. According to him, so far, ""the only sensible country seems to be Lithuania that is seeking backing from the UN to open a humanitarian corridor from the Belarus border with Poland to the Grodno airport to allow migrants to return home"". Meanwhile, the solution to the problem requires Poland and the EU to diplomatically engage with Belarus through negotiations, not threats, underscores Earl Rasmussen.",russian,1,1017,95.9,40.06,28.23,7.14,29.91,30.29,77.38,54.67,45.92,5.11,1.47,0.1,0.29,0,0.29,0.39,3.64,15.14,11.31,0.88,15.44,5.01,3.83,5.21,1.18,9.83,4.23,1.67,6.19,1.28,0.79,4.03,8.95,0.79,8.16,1.87,0.98,0.79,1.18,0.39,2.65,0.1,5.31,1.77,3.24,0.79,0,0.59,0.29,0.29,0,0.1,9.34,5.41,1.28,0.1,0.79,1.47,0.88,3.74,0,0.1,0,0.29,6.88,4.23,2.65,0,2.75,0.49,0.2,1.67,0.1,0.29,0.29,0.2,0,0,0,0,0,0.1,0,1.18,0,0.2,0,0,0,0,1.28,0,2.85,9.14,0.29,1.38,7.18,0.29,0,0.39,2.85,1.57,5.51,0.59,0,0,0,0,0,16.32,3.24,5.9,0.1,0,1.97,5.11

Among these proposals are guarantees from NATO not to deploy offensive weapons in Eastern Europe and especially Ukraine. All options, including the deployment of nuclear weapons in Belarus, will be considered in the event of NATO's refusal to discuss the security proposals, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday. The ministry also underlined that sending US military personnel to Ukraine will escalate the situation, noting that Moscow hopes Washington understands the dangerous consequences of doing so. ""We believe that such steps will only lead to a further escalation of the situation around Ukraine, and in our relations with the West as a whole, including the United States. I believe that, after all, there are reasonable people in Washington who understand the full danger of such actions"", Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko told reporters. Aside from this, Rudenko said that Russia sees no need to involve Ukraine in the negotiations with NATO and the United States on the security guarantees. ""So far, our draft agreements have been sent to only two sides - the United States and the North Atlantic Alliance. We did not send anything to Ukraine, but, of course, Ukraine is aware of it, like everyone else. At this stage, we do not see the need for their participation"", he said. Rudenko said that Moscow is waiting for an official response from the United States and NATO on the security proposals - which include the demand that NATO not put offensive weapons in the countries neighbouring Russia. Simmering Tensions The West continues to accuse Russia of ""amassing troops"" in the vicinity of the Ukrainian border and ""preparing to invade"" its neighbour. Moscow, for its part, has repeatedly said that Russian troops move within the country's borders and do not pose a threat to anyone. With tensions heating up, Belarusian officials warned Western countries that the Baltic States will be ""swept off the face of the Earth"" should a serious military conflict unfold in the region. Belarusian Security Council deputy chief Maj. Gen. Vladimir Archakov accused the Baltic countries and other Western nations of aggravating regional tensions, particularly pointing to Washington's use of Polish airspace to conduct optical-electronic reconnaissance of Belarusian territory. Earlier, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said that Minsk will suggest that Russia deploy nuclear weapons in Belarusian territory if NATO does the same in Poland. Moscow has consistently underlined that it is up to the West to take action in order to de-escalate the situation and negotiate the security proposals that Russia rolled out last week, demanding that the NATO alliance give up the idea of placing offensive weapons in Eastern Europe. While several states, like Norway and Sweden, have already blasted the security proposals as ""completely unrealistic"" and ""unacceptable"", others, like China, welcomed them as something that could reduce the risk of conflict.

Uzbekistan sees no need to restore its membership in the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), Uzbekistan’s Foreign Minister Abdulaziz Kamilov told Russian reporters on Friday. ""Today we see no need for Uzbekistan to rejoin the CSTO on the belief that there will be some offensive by regiments, armies or divisions towards Central Asia and Uzbekistan. However, threats and challenges from some terrorist organizations that continue operating on the territory of Afghanistan cannot be ruled out,"" the top diplomat said. ""It is not a matter of designating somehow our accession to the CSTO. It is a matter of how to effectively build our collective cooperation in the security sphere,"" he pointed out. The forms of the republic’s interaction with the post-Soviet security bloc may change, depending on the situation, the foreign minister said. ""At least for now we do not see the need for restoring Uzbekistan’s membership in the CSTO. However, active interaction is simultaneously underway with the Russian Federation and neighboring states on security issues to some extent,"" he pointed out. Tashkent believes that a priority task today is to timely fend off pinpointed terrorist challenges and threats, Kamilov said.

US President Joe Biden has claimed that ""there is every indication"" that Russia is ""prepared"" to invade Ukraine, insisting that Washington has “reason to believe” that Moscow is “engaged in a false flag operation to have an excuse to go in”. ""My sense it will happen within the next several days"", he claimed. Speaking at the White House, POTUS said Washington saw no signs of a Russian troop pullback along its border with Ukraine. The president went on to allege that the threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine is ""very high"", and said that he had no plans to call his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. Shortly after Biden's statement, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken delivered a speech to the UN Security Council, repeating the same allegations - without providing any proof - and going as far as to claim that the ""Russia-manufactured"" pretext to invade Ukraine could include a ""fake or real attack using chemical weapons"". Russia has repeatedly said it does not plan to attack any country, including Ukraine. ""If Russia doesn't invade Ukraine, then we will be relieved that Russia changed course and proved our predictions wrong,"" Blinken said. ""We’ll gladly accept any criticism that anyone directs at us."" Blinken asserted that the information that the United States has on Russia’s potential invasion of Ukraine is ""validated by what we’ve seen unfolding in plain sight before our eyes for months"". He then informed the UNSC that he had sent a letter to Russian Foreign Minister Sergeo Lavrov to propose a meeting next week in Europe to address the Ukraine crisis. ""Earlier today, I sent a letter to Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov proposing that we meet next week in Europe following up on our  talks in recent weeks to discuss the steps we can take to resolve this crisis without conflict. We are also proposing meetings at the NATO-Russia Council and the OSCE  Permanent Council. These meetings can pave the way for a summit of key leaders in the context of deescalation."" “I am here today not to start a war but to prevent one,” Blinken said. Biden and Blinken's words echoed earlier allegations by British officials, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who claimed that the shelling of a kindergarten in eastern Ukraine ""was a false flag operation"" designed to create a pretext for Russian military action. The Russian side has already slammed Kiev for staging provocations in Donbass. ""We have repeatedly warned that the excessive concentration of Ukrainian armed forces in the immediate vicinity of the demarcation line, coupled with possible provocations, could pose a terrible danger. Now we see that these terrible provocations are going on, we see reports from  representatives of the self-proclaimed republics that mutual attacks are taking place on the line of contact, that the first attack came from Ukraine. This is disturbing information. We keep monitoring,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday. West Stoking Russian Invasion Fears Just a month ago, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki claimed that the US had information that Russia was planning to fabricate a pretext for an invasion of Ukraine by using operatives to carry out a false flag event. ""As  part of its plans, Russia’s laying the groundwork to have the option of  fabricating a pretext for invasion,"" Psaki told a press briefing. ""We have information that indicates Russia has already pre-positioned a  group of operatives to conduct a false flag operation in eastern Ukraine. The operatives are trained in urban warfare and in using explosives to carry out acts of sabotage against Russia’s own proxy forces."" The situation on the line of contact in Ukraine's breakaway Donbass republics has deteriorated significantly over the past day, with Kiev making attempts to escalate the conflict, the militia of the Lugansk People's Republic said. The Ukrainian military has repeatedly fired mortar shells and grenades at multiple localities in the self-proclaimed Lugansk and Donetsk People's Republics. Western media and US intelligence claimed that Russia would launch an offensive against Ukraine on 15-16 February, something which didn't happen. The claims about an ""imminent"" Russian invasion ""scheduled for 16 February"" began circulating in Western media last week, with the claims being backed by US politicians who said that the invasion could happen any day. Several Western countries, including the US and the UK, used these reports to urge all Americans to leave Ukraine ahead of a ""looming"" invasion. On Thursday, Politico, citing analysts, gave a list of reasons why Russia could invade Ukraine after 20 February, branding the previous date of the anticipated attack – February 16 – as a distraction from the actual dates. According to analysts, cited by the newspaper in a report on Wednesday,  the 16 February invasion scenario was overestimated and aimed at diverting attention from the real key dates, which is after 20 February for several reasons. Firstly, according to the analysts, the date marks the end of Russian-Belarusian joint exercises, after which Russian troops are supposed to return home. In this regard, Moscow’s intentions will become clear based on the actions of the Russian military after 20 February,  the newspaper said. Secondly, the date will be the end of the Munich Security Conference, which will be attended by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, US Vice President Kamala Harris, and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. According to the newspaper, a ""Russian invasion"" at the time when the Ukrainian leader is outside his country would be a geopolitical trolling allegedly favoured by none other than Vladimir Putin.Last but not least, 20 February is the last day of the Winter Olympics in Beijing so  Russia will not launch the attack against Ukraine before that date to ""please"" Chinese President Xi Jinping, the newspaper said. The tensions around Ukraine have escalated n recent weeks, with the United States and the European Union accusing Russia of a ""massive military build-up"" at the Ukrainian border, and NATO urging allies to boost their military support for Kiev. Russia, in turn, has repeatedly denied allegations of intending to invade its neighbour, pointing out that NATO's military activity near Russian borders poses a threat to its national security while hampering efforts toward peaceful resolution in Ukraine.

On Migration Crisis on Belarus-Poland Border Minsk will try to resolve the issue with refugees on the Belarusian-Polish border until the end of the year, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said in an interview with RIA Novosti. ""I told her [German Acting Chancellor Angela Merkel] straight away … I will try to solve this problem before the New Year because we do not need it. People [migrants] are now in Minsk, now in Grodno,"" Lukashenko said.According to Lukashenko, Belarus will ask migrants who are there legally ""to go back because we have no humanitarian corridor.""The Belarusian president mentioned that over 1,000 Iraqis have already left Belarus. The European Union’s refusal to build refugee camps and sanctions became reasons for the migration crisis on Belarusian borders, Lukashenko believes.He mentioned that Minsk and Brussels had a readmission agreement in the past and Belarus took back migrants if they appear in the EU via its territory and placed them in camps. ""They [the EU] had to build the camps, and they began to build, and then they stopped. And I stopped taking them from there,"" Lukashenko said. The Belarusian president added that the EU broke the readmission agreement first and then imposed sanctions against Minsk.""I honestly told them about this at the very beginning: guys, you went to aggravate relations. You accuse us of this plane [the Ryanair incident]. Although not a single fact was presented,"" Lukashenko added. Lukashenko said that the country has spent about $25 million on aid to refugees on the border with Poland. ""Twelve and a half million dollars was paid, as of a week ago ... Now it will be twice as much,"" Lukashenko said in an interview with RIA Novosti. He clarified that this refers to the costs of providing migrants with food, treatment, heating.  At the same time, the president expressed the opinion that international assistance to refugees who are now in the transport and logistics centre near the Belarusian-Polish border could be more significant than now.  ""The World Health Organization sent some stockings, pads, diapers or whatever,"" he said. On NATO Manoeuvres in the Baltic States and Ukraine Amid NATO manoeuvres in the Baltic and in Ukraine, Minsk has a plan and combat units to respond to attempts to start a conflict,  Lukashenko said in an interview with RIA Novosti. ""So they started these manoeuvres in Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and Ukraine. What should I do as commander-in-chief? I should not succumb to these provocations, but I must foresee what will happen so that it does not happen, as it was in 1941,"" he said. ""Therefore, I have to have plans and units, divisions of the Belarusian army that will react to any attempt to create a conflict here. On the border of the Baltic states, Poland and Ukraine..."" Lukashenko said. Minsk will propose to Moscow to deploy nuclear weapons in Belarus if similar NATO systems appear in Poland, the Belarusian President added. Earlier in November, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that the alliance may move nuclear weapons to the eastern European countries if Germany refuses to deploy them.Lukashenko said that Minsk and Moscow will come to an agreement on what kind of systems to deploy.""The nuclear weapon that will be most effective in such contact. We are ready for this on the territory of Belarus,"" he said. On the Status of Crimea Crimea de facto and de jure became a part of Russia after a referendum, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko told Ria Novosti in an interview. ""We all understood that Crimea is de facto Russian Crimea. After the referendum, Crimea became Russian de jure,"" Lukashenko said. He added that he plans to visit Crimea and agreed on it with Russian President Vladimir Putin.""We have a definite agreement with Putin that we will spend time in Crimea,"" Lukashenko said, adding that he has been invited to the peninsula. Lukashenko also said that he wants to start his trip to Crimea from Sevastopol.“We talked about this [the trip to Crimea] three times [with Putin]. And he has to decide for himself when the time would be more convenient … I told him ill come when you invite me” he said.Lukashenko added that his trip to Crimea would mean its recognition as part of Russia by Minsk. “If the president has already arrived there [in Crimea] … With the president of Russia.

Ukraine was a particular problem, as UK government files reveal. There was never any question in Western minds of whether or not to recognise Russia. The European Community, the precursor to the European Union, issued a statement on 23 December 1991, noting that, ""the international rights and obligations of the former USSR, including those under the UN Charter, will continue to be exercised by Russia. They welcome the Russian government's acceptance of these commitments and responsibilities and in this capacity will continue their dealings with Russia, taking account of the modification of her constitutional status"". Privately British politicians were careful to point out that legally it was not ""recognition"" of a new state. As Percy Craddock, foreign policy adviser to Prime Minister John Major explained: ""We have not 'recognised' Russia: we do not need to do so, since we regard it as the continuation of the former Soviet Union under international law"". Regarding the recognition of the other ex-USSR states, both Britons and Europeans had a ""number of continuing concerns about the policies of the republics"". The twelve member states of the EC attached ""the highest importance to single and secure control of nuclear weapons, to the early accession of all republics [that remained in the USSR by that time], to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as Non-Nuclear Weapons State, to acceptance by [the] republics of the commitments of the CFE Treaty and other Arms Control Agreements"". And, of course, they expected the republics to honour their share of Soviet foreign debt. The recognition was contingent upon acceptance by the republics of the conditions in the statement of the twelve issued by the Dutch presidency of the EC. The portends were not good. The British Embassy telegraphed on the squabbles at the Minsk summit among the leaders of the newly-proclaimed Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS): ""after 8-10 hours of difficult and at times contentious negotiation the commonwealth leaders in Minsk…evidently failed to agree on the most important military and economic issues"". Ukrainian Intransigence At the Minsk summit on 30 December, the leaders did not sign an overarching charter, apparently ready in draft, because of objections by President Kravchuk of Ukraine. British Ambassador to the USSR Sir Rodric Braithwaite reported back to London: ""Evidently because of Ukrainian intransigence there was very little progress on putting any substance into the commonwealth as a political entity"". John Major's foreign policy adviser Sir Percy Craddock briefed the prime minister: ""Ukraine still deeply suspicious of Russia, continues to block all avenues to real coordination in the new commonwealth"". The behaviour of the republican leaders at a later press conference told its own story, reported British Ambassador in Moscow Rodric Braithwaite. ""Yeltsin was careful in his comments and conciliatory in approach. Kravchuk had fewer inhibitions: obviously pleased with himself, he made a late and theatrical entrance, at one point waving to the television cameras while Yeltsin was trying to answer a question"". Negotiation with Belarus and Kazakhstan was relatively easy, said British diplomats, who observed the talks, but Ukraine was a different matter and the British foresaw political problems, by far the most serious of which would be over the military. While other Republics were content to leave the umbrella command of their armed forces to Russia, at least temporarily, “The Ukrainians are determined to set up their own armed forces and withdraw from military cooperation, even if this jeopardises the commonwealth,” observed the British Ambassador. Yet, in spite of ""Ukraine's intransigence"", the British had decided to recognise it, even while their hero Gorbachev was still presiding over the Soviet Union. A briefing note from the Foreign Office informed 10 Downing Street on 23 December 1991 that ""plans already existed to open a separate British Embassy in Kiev"". In fact, an embryonic British Embassy in Kiev sprang up in June 1990, when an ""advance party"" of three British diplomats set up shop at the historic Hotel Kiev, now the Premier Palace Hotel in the city centre, officially to prepare for a visit by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. It was immediately christened by the locals as ""the British Embassy"". At the same time, Thatcher assured Gorbachev she did not want to undermine Moscow in its relations with the republics. British foreign policy threw up quite a few ambiguities. Confusion Over the End of the USSR Since the EC [EU] statement on recognition of the republics referred to ""the moment the dissolution of the Soviet Union enters into force"", British Ambassador Sir Rodric Brathwaite asked then-Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev when the dissolution would be formally announced. Kozyrev replied that this was unclear. ""There might well not be a formal ceremony. Though the Supreme Soviet of the Union was meeting today, it was not clear whether the meeting would have a quorum, or even legal status, or the powers to declare the Union over. And – if we were all arguing that Russia was simply a continuation of the Soviet Union – there was something to be said for this lack of clarity"", Kozyrev said. Rodric Braithwaite suggested that ""perhaps we should simply take the hauling down of the red flag over the Kremlin as marking the moment of dissolution. He [Kozyrev] agreed, but was not even clear whether this would happen on the 30th (as we had expected) or earlier"", Rodric Brathwaite said. The British were worried there would be precious little time for the Dutch presidency of the EC to obtain assurances from the various republics referred to in the statement of the twelve. They needn't have worried, as Big Brother stepped in: ""…now that [the] Americans have recognised all republics it is clear that our partners in the Twelve [EC/EU] will wish to go ahead without delay"". The British did not want to be outdone. Recognition messages to the leaders of the ex-Soviet republics were quickly drafted for prime ministerial approval on 30 December. The Foreign Office was relieved that ""agreement has been reached that nuclear weapons should remain under [the] single control [of Russia], and that Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus will become non-nuclear weapon states"". But there were still ""some profoundly worrying aspects"" regarding nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons held by the republics. As senior British diplomat, Sir Len Appleyard, sent by Prime Minister Major on a fact-finding mission to Moscow, Minsk, and Kiev in mid-December 1991, reported: ""The wilder fringe of the Ukrainian political spectrum could present problems in all these areas"". Independent, But Not Sovereign? The recognition letters sent out to the emergent countries contained a curious edit: the formula ""sovereign state"", initially put in the draft, was deleted from the approved letter. ""The United Kingdom has separately recognised as independent sovereign states, Ukraine, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and the Azerbaijan Republic"". The prime minister's letter to President Yeltsin was different from the rest: ""I have considered this in details with my G7 colleagues, and taken full account of the recent historic developments which have led to continuity of statehood between Russia and the former Soviet Union. Its international rights and obligations including those under the UN Charter will now be those of Russia"". John Major also explained that Britain regarded all treaties and agreements in force to which the United Kingdom and the USSR were party as remaining intact upon the ""renaming of your country as Russia. Relations between our states continue taking account of constitutional changes and the change in your name"". The British were still hopeful that the replacement of the USSR with the CIS could work, and told the republics: ""We welcome the establishment of the Commonwealth of Independent States, and shall do all in our power to help the development of stable, peaceful, and prosperous relations between the states formerly part of the Soviet Union"". Prime Minister Major even expressed an interest in making reference to the possibility of Russia representing the CIS in the UN Security Council, just like Britain and France agreed in effect to further the views of the European Community/Union in the Security Council. There was an important caveat in recognising the borders of the new states: the republics must resolve their territorial disputes among themselves, and not drag London into them. ""Recognition shall not be taken to imply acceptance by Her Majesty's government of the position of any of the republics concerning territory which is the subject of a dispute between two or more republics"". The British had a reason for such a caveat. As top British diplomats observed: ""It is remarkable that after a matter of 3 ½ hours negotiation 11 republic leaders have agreed on an expanded commonwealth of independent states"". ""The durability of agreements reached so rapidly by states with so many conflicting aims and interests must be in doubt"". As a result, Sir Len Appleyard warned: ""We have a prospect of a new band of basically pro-Western, politically assertive, and quarrelsome independent states running from the Baltic down to Central Europe"". The British assumed that the definitive version of the agreement on the creation of the CIS was that agreed upon in Minsk. However, in his Alma Ata [then the capital of Kazakhstan] press conference, the Ukrainian president implied that he regarded as valid both the original version and the watered down document ratified by his own parliament. Kiev's ambiguity has been haunting the CIS and Ukraine's relations with Russia over these past 30 years.",russian,1,1606,96.69,45.58,34.61,35.21,27.22,31.57,82.38,60.9,49,5.29,2.43,0.12,0.68,0.12,0.62,0.81,2.86,17,11.77,1.56,16.63,5.54,3.36,5.48,1,9.34,7.47,2.37,7.35,2.24,0.5,4.61,11.64,0.5,11.08,2.18,1.31,1.31,1.74,0.87,3.8,0,3.42,2.24,1.18,0.75,0.19,0.56,0.19,0.19,0.06,0,9.34,4.17,0.19,0.93,0.44,0.12,1.62,5.04,0.06,0,0.25,0.93,8.78,5.67,2.8,0.31,2.8,0.31,0,2.24,0.37,0.06,0.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06,0.12,0.25,0.62,0.06,0.06,0,0,0.37,0.25,2.18,8.22,0.5,1.06,6.6,0.5,0,0,4.11,5.6,0.93,1.06,0.12,0.06,0.06,0,0,16.25,3.74,5.17,0.06,0,0.62,6.66

",English,Russia,"US officials had warned their European counterparts that Russia may be planning a potential invasion of Ukraine, Bloomberg reported on 11 November, falling short of providing any evidence to back the claims. What's actually behind the latest ""Russian invasion"" story? During a Wednesday meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart, Secretary of State Antony Blinken justified Washington's suspicions by mentioning Russia's ""playbook"", admitting, however, that the US has zero ""clarity into Moscow's intentions"". The US secretary of state referred to the 2014 post-coup events in Ukraine – when Crimea held a peninsula-wide referendum on reunification with Russia – as an example of Moscow's ""invasion"" politics. Western Media Crying Wolf Over Potential Russian 'Invasion' ""Washington knows that Russia is not going to invade Ukraine"", says Dr Paul Craig Roberts, ex-assistant secretary of the treasury under Ronald Reagan and former member of the Cold War Committee on the Present Danger. ""The Kremlin doesn't want Ukraine. Putin would not even accept the Russian populated Donetsk and Lugansk Republics that voted to be reincorporated into Russia. So the real questions are: Are the Biden regime foreign policy advisers incompetent? Is the Biden regime scaring Europe in order to achieve European approval of Ukraine as a NATO member? Does the Biden regime intend to provoke a Russian invasion of Ukraine?"" Moscow has nothing to gain from war, echoes Dan Lazare, investigative journalist and author of ""America's Undeclared War"", stressing that the accusations against Russia are ridiculous. Kiev, however, does benefit from a buildup in tensions, according to him. ""The goal is more US aid, more US military support, and more American muscle aimed at forcing Moscow into some sort of humiliating retreat – or so the Zelensky government hopes and believes"", Lazare says. This is not the first time the US and its NATO allies have sounded the alarm over Russia's alleged plans to enter its neighbour's territory. In mid-March 2021, western media circulated warnings about Moscow's potential preparations for a war with Ukraine, citing internal movements of Russian troops within the country's western regions. In particular, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg dubbed Russia's internal manoeuvres ""the largest massing of Russian troops since the illegal annexation of Crimea"". However, none of the fears cited by the western press has translated into reality. In October 2021, US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin revived the debate over Ukraine's NATO membership and groundlessly accused Russia of ""occupying"" Crimea and ""perpetuating the war in eastern Ukraine"". For its part, Moscow warned the US that any expansion of NATO military installations in Ukraine would cross its ""red lines"". Last week, 15 GOP House lawmakers called upon Joe Biden to increase the amount of lethal aid for the Kiev government and deploy American forces to the Black Sea. ""Russia's behaviour is becoming more aggressive, and it has intensified rhetoric critical of Ukraine on topics ranging from Ukraine's military modernisation and military partnerships to Ukraine's admission into NATO"", the congressmen's letter said as quoted by the New York Post. US-NATO Drills in the Black Sea Earlier this month, the US Sixth Fleet announced that its flagship, USS Mount Whitney, was heading to the Black Sea for routine maritime drills with the nation's NATO allies and partners. The Russian Defence Ministry noted on 11 November that US and NATO military activities in the Black Sea region had dramatically increased. In particular, four NATO reconnaissance planes were detected and escorted by Russian anti-aircraft missile forces. The transatlantic alliance's unscheduled drills in close proximity to Russia's borders have been called a threat to regional stability by Moscow. ""It makes no military sense for Washington to have its Navy exposed in the Black Sea where the ships could be easily sunk"", suggests Dr Roberts. ""Maybe the Biden regime is offering bait to the Russians hoping for an incident that will renew European fear of Russia and advance NATO membership for Ukraine"". The root cause of Washington's belligerent rhetoric and brazen maneouvres is that ""the US military/security complex needs Russia as an enemy for its power and profit and for its hold on Europe"", highlights the former Reagan official. ""President Trump threatened this need by saying he intended to restore 'normal relations' with Russia and was removed from office"", Dr Roberts adds. Poland-Belarus Border Crisis The situation has been exacerbated by the migrant crisis on the Poland-Belarus border, says Dan Lazare. Warsaw has already blamed Russia and Belarus for the influx of migrants, while Ursula von der Leyen described the situation as a ""hybrid attack"" against the EU. For its part, Washington is mulling over a fresh batch of sanctions against companies and state actors allegedly involved in transferring Middle Eastern and Central Asian refugees to Poland's border. Moscow has dismissed the allegations as false and beyond the pale, while Minsk explained that it cannot hold the refugees due to the pressure of western sanctions on the Belarusian economy. ""Then there's the migrant crisis, which is further driving up tensions throughout the region"", says Lazare. ""While the US wants everyone to think it's all Lukashenko's fault, it conveniently forgets its own role in creating the migrant crisis in the first place"". Lazare notes that the refugee crisis was originally caused by the US-NATO invasion of Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya, and a proxy war on Syria. In addition, the US created further chaos by backing a coup d'etat in Kiev, the investigative journalist underscores.

In early 2015, Russia, Germany and France arranged a fragile ceasefire agreement between Kiev and the Donbass militias. The Ukrainian military is continuing the illegal deployment of weapons and military equipment in settlements near the contact line, Lugansk People’s Republic militia spokesman Ivan Filipenko has said. In a Sunday briefing summarising the situation on the front, Filipenko indicated that although there have been no violations of the ceasefire reported over the past 24 hours, the Ukrainian military “has continued to deploy weapons and military equipment in settlements under Ukraine’s control,” in violation of agreements banning such weapons from settlements near the frontline. Filipenko also reported that Ukrainian forces have deployed a mobile radio electronic warfare system to suppress the control and navigation channels used by Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe drones tasked with monitoring the situation on the ground. Media Provocations Lugansk People’s Republic intelligence has also uncovered the presence of journalists from Ukraine’s Channel 5 and ICTV in the conflict zone, with the media working together with officers from the Ukrainian armed forces to “prepare staged videos meant to compromise the people’s militia,” according to Filipenko. “The reports that are being prepared, apart from interviews with phony ‘local residents’ and Ukrainian militants, feature footage of the destruction of civilian facilities which were actually destroyed in the course of the fighting in 2014. Furthermore, the Ukrainian propagandists are tasked with lionising the personnel on the frontline to reduce the number of personnel refusing to renew their contract for further service,” the spokesman said. Local residents in the Ukrainian army-controlled settlement of Valuyskoye previously reported on the takeover of the village school by nationalist battalions and equipment, with vehicles containing armed fighters, artillery reconnaissance, observation and target designation equipment and radio stations said to have been deployed in the area. “Kiev’s use of a secondary school in the village of Valuyskoye to deploy the headquarters of a combat unit and a fire control point for Ukrainian artillery is a flagrant violation of the ceasefire agreement and of international humanitarian law,” Filipenko said. 7+ Year Conflict The Lugansk People’s republic submitted more than 100 war crimes complaints to the International Criminal Court and the European Court of Human Rights in 2021 over alleged criminal actions taken by the Ukrainian security forces. Earlier, LPR official Anna Soroka estimated that the Lugansk and Donetsk Republics together filed over 3,000 claims against Kiev over suspected war crimes by the Ukrainian military. The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in the spring of 2014, when Kiev launched a military operation to try to crush independence-seeking forces in the country’s east after the February 2014 Western-backed coup in Kiev. The war led to the deaths of up to 31,000 people, with tens of thousands more injured, and more than 2.5 million residents either externally or internally displaced. In February 2015, the Normandy Four contact group, consisting of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France negotiated a peace agreement in the Belarusian capital of Minsk. The agreement put a freeze on the hot phase of the conflict (although the ceasefire has occasionally been punctured by violations including shootings and artillery strikes). The peace deal’s political phase – which requires Kiev provide the Donbass with broad autonomy in exchange for the region’s peaceful reintegration with Ukraine, has not been carried through amid stiff resistance from the country’s successive governments. In mid-2020, additional security measures were agreed to try to ensure the stability of the ceasefire, among them a complete ban on the deployment of weapons in and near populated areas, and prohibitions on any offensive, reconnaissance and sabotage operations by either side. The restrictions also forbade the use of drones. In the spring of 2021 and again in the autumn, Donbass militias expressed fears that Kiev forces may be getting ready to try to resolve the civil conflict in the east by force. Over the past several months, Kiev and its western allies have sought to deflect from these concerns by claiming that Russia is amassing troops on the border in preparation for an invasion of Ukraine. Moscow has dismissed allegations of any invasion plans. However, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has warned that Russia would “take all the necessary measures” to protect the hundreds of thousands of Donbass residents who have been granted Russian citizenship, at the same time that Moscow continues to make every effort “to resolve the internal Ukrainian conflict by political and diplomatic means.”",russian,1,774,99,40.84,32.59,4.29,33.65,37.6,77.26,52.33,42.76,2.07,0.39,0,0,0,0,0.26,1.68,15.12,11.37,2.71,18.48,3.75,1.29,4.91,0.26,7.24,5.81,2.33,8.79,0.9,0.65,7.24,7.11,0.39,6.46,0.78,1.68,0.52,0.9,0.13,2.07,0,4.13,1.03,3.1,0.26,0,0.26,0.13,0.13,0,0,6.85,4.78,0.78,0.13,1.55,0.9,1.29,2.45,0,0,0,0.26,6.33,4.13,2.07,0.13,2.71,0,0.52,2.2,0,0,0.26,0.13,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.13,0.26,0,0.52,0,0.13,0,0,0.65,0,1.42,10.59,0.65,0.65,9.04,0.13,0,0.26,3.62,3.49,1.94,0.9,0,0,0,0,0,12.14,3.1,4.65,0,0,1.68,2.71

Moscow has consistently rejected any claim that it is a military threat to any other country and condemned what it characterises as a ""fearmongering"" press. Russian President Vladimir Putin purportedly has a ready-made plan stored in a drawer of a table for a military offensive that would see the seizure of two-thirds of Ukraine's territory, including the capital, the German tabloid Bild has reported, citing what it called high-ranking anonymous security sources from NATO and Ukrainian intelligence. To hear the unnamed sources tell it, the Russian president has not decided whether the alleged plan should be implemented. The western intelligence assessments cited by Bild claim that an offensive might start in January or February 2022, should NATO and Kiev not respond to the Kremlin's demands. Among the purported demands is the cessation of the alliance's eastward advance and redeployments of troops, as well as the banning of Ukraine's admission to NATO. Alleged Three-Phase Plan Bild cites several anonymous NATO sources as claiming that the alleged Russian invasion plan includes three stages: During the first stage, Moscow's forces deployed in Crimea purportedly should attack Ukraine's south with troops deploying from the sea near Odessa and airborne special forces dropping on Kherson. The aim of these attacks is to allegedly cut off Ukraine from supplies by sea. By advancing further along the Dnieper River, Russian forces will allegedly cut off Ukrainian forces in the east from supplies coming from the west by seizing bridges. At the same time, the armed forces deployed on the territory of the self-proclaimed people's republics in the east will simultaneously attack the Ukrainian Army and advance to the Zaporizhia region and then towards Crimea, according to the anonymous sources. The second stage would purportedly hinge on the reaction of the international community and the success of the first, the tabloid claims. ""If Russia goes in, the sanctions against it will be applied anyway. After that, it doesn't make sense to stop halfway anymore"", one of Bild's sources claimed. Under the alleged plan, the second stage would see Russian tanks and air force assets cross the Ukrainian border near the Lugansk and Kharkov regions to seize the cities of Dnipro and Poltava. The third and final stage would start with the encirclement of Kiev, which would be carried out by forces coming from Belarussian territory, the tabloid claims. Yet, under certain circumstances, the seizure of the capital might be carried out at the start of the campaign one source told Bild. Another source allegedly estimated that the Ukrainians would put up a fight, but will undoubtedly lose to a larger Russian force. Kremlin Denies Any Plan to Attack Anyone The Bild report follows in the footsteps of allegations made by The Washington Post and the Associated Press, citing anonymous sources in the US intelligence community. Both news outlets claim that Russia plans to deploy as many as 175,000 troops with plans to attack Ukrainian territory. Commenting on these reports, US President Joe Biden stated that he would make it ""very, very difficult'' for Russia to attack its western neighbour and vowed to have a ""long discussion"" with Putin regarding the situation around Ukraine. The two presidents are set to have a conversation on 7 December, discussing, among other urgent topics, issues surrounding Ukraine, including continuing media reports about an alleged Russian military buildup at the border. The Kremlin has repeatedly rejected allegations that Russia poses a military threat to its neighbours, slamming a ""fake news campaign"" targeting Moscow. Russia further insisted that the movements of troops on its sovereign territory are of nobody's concern. At the same time, the Kremlin has repeatedly denounced efforts by some western countries to pump Ukraine with weapons thus giving Kiev an incentive to use military force to resolve its internal conflict instead of through the use of negotiation and diplomacy.",russian,1,666,98.33,45.39,22.54,3.62,27.75,32.43,80.78,54.65,46.25,4.95,0.45,0,0.3,0,0.15,0,4.5,17.42,11.71,2.1,16.52,5.26,1.65,4.05,0.6,10.06,4.5,2.85,10.81,1.8,1.95,7.06,12.61,0.15,12.46,2.1,3.45,1.65,2.85,0.15,2.25,0,3.75,0.75,3,0.45,0,0.45,0,0.45,0,0,10.06,6.31,0.15,0.15,2.25,0.6,1.95,3.45,0,0,0,0.15,6.46,4.5,1.95,0,1.8,0,0.3,1.35,0.15,0,0.3,0.3,0.3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.15,0,0.15,0,0,0,0.3,0.6,0,3.6,9.16,0,1.5,7.21,0.45,0.15,0.15,2.7,1.35,2.4,2.1,0,0,0,0,0,12.46,3.6,4.8,0,0,1.8,2.25

""We are looking at the situation at the moment. On Monday, foreign ministers are to have a discussion to decide if extra measures are needed,"" Stano said, when asked for a comment on reports about Russia’s growing military presence on the border with Belarus. ""The information that we have at our disposal is causing rather large concerns. We are discussing and exchanging information with our partners, including Britain and the US, and contemplating likely extra measures,"" he said. Asked if the European Union agreed there was a routine exercise underway, Stano said: ""When an ordinary exercise is on the agenda, there exist certain rules and procedures to be observed, such as timely notification of partners. This was not done earlier this year. For this reason we had an in-depth discussion of this issue at the foreign minister level in April."" It is expected that the same issue may be raised when the EU’s defense ministers gather for a meeting on November 16, to which NATO’s Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg will be invited. According to diplomatic sources, the United States provided its own data regarding Russian troops near the border with Ukraine.

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko on Friday said it’s important for the West to ""drown Russian-Ukrainian brotherhood in blood."" In a state-of-the-nation speech, he said Ukraine is a subject of a behind-the-scenes tradeoff, which is pushed into a conflict and being prepared for an aggression. ""The building up of tensions in the south causes the greatest alarm,"" he said. ""Ukraine is becoming a subject of a behind-the-scenes tradeoff."" ""The Ukrainians are being pushed into the flames of a conflict, they are being broken mentally, purposefully prepared for an aggression while hostile feelings to brotherly peoples, including Belarusians, are being shaped up,"" the president said. ""It’s important for the West to drown the Russian-Ukrainian brotherhood, our Slavic brotherhood in blood."" Lukashenko said he thought Western countries will persist in disrupting the situation in former Soviet countries to weaken Russia. ""The situation in Kazakhstan showed that not only the Slavic brotherhood, but also the Central Asian one has become a target,"" he said in a state-of-the-nation speech. ""It’s obvious that the West, with the aim of weakening Russia, will get on with the tactic of disturbing the post-Soviet space."" ""Must we, given the situation, react and build up our defense capabilities?"" he went on to say. ""The answer is obvious: Alas, if you want peace, prepare for war."" There has been a flurry of statements in the West and Kiev lately that Russia could invade Ukraine. Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said they were unsubstantiated escalation and that Russia doesn’t threaten anyone. At the same time, he didn’t rule out provocations to corroborate these Western statements and warned that the use of force to resolve the crisis in southeastern Ukraine will have serious consequences. Mass riots erupted in Kazakhstan in early January, with attacks on the police and the military. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev described the events as an attempted coup. The situation was stabilized by January 7 while the emergency situation lasted in some regions until January 19.

Russian President Vladimir Putin stated on Saturday that NATO drills near Russia's border are a dangerous challenge because the bloc is using its strategic air forces. ""Now, the United States and its NATO allies are conducting unscheduled, I want to underline it, unscheduled drills in the waters of the Black Sea. And not only a powerful ship group has been formed, but also aviation, strategic aviation, is being used in the drills"", Putin said. ""I should say that our Defence Ministry also proposed to hold its own unplanned exercises in the same area. But I believe that this is not appropriate and there is no need to further escalate the situation there"", Putin told the TV channel Russia 24. The president's statements come after the US and its allies launched drills near Russian waters. Previously, the United States Sixth Fleet's flagship USS Mount Whitney enetered the Black Sea, and Russia registerd multiple reconnaissance flights by NATO aircraft near the Crimea. Moscow has repeatedly slammed NATO's activities in the Black Sea as a provocation to spur tensions and pursue a policy of containment of Russia. Putin recently called the drills ""destabilising"" and ""dangerous"", while Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stressed that by sending their vessels to the area near the Russian border Washington is trying to push coastal countries toward confrontational policies. Situation in Ukraine In his  interview, Putin also dismissed claims that Russia is planning an invasion of Ukraine, saying it is pure ""alarmism"", and stressing that his country is not a side in the conflict in Donbass. He commented on the current situation in the region, saying that Ukraine had officially confirmed it has been using Turkish-made Bayraktar drones in the area - which is strictly prohibited by the Minsk agreements. Last month, the Ukrainian General Staff claimed that the military had destroyed an enemy howitzer with a guided bomb launched via a Bayraktar strike drone in Donbass. According to Moscow, Kiev is acting in a provocative manner to trigger a response from the local militia and get Russia involved. Migrant Crisis The Russian president additionally commented on the migrant crisis that is unfolding along the Belarus-Poland border, stressing once again that Moscow has no ties to that situation. ""Everyone is trying to impose responsibility on us for various reasons - and for no reasons at all"", the president stated. He stressed that Russian airlines do not transport migrants, and are not responsible for those individuals now on the Poland-Belarus border. ""All the time we have heard that humanitarian issues should be put in first place. Now, at the Poland-Belarus border Polish border guards beating those migrants, firing live rounds above their heads, turning on sirens - day or night - near those places where children and women are in the last months of pregnancy are settled - somehow this does not really fit with the humane ideas that supposedly underlie the entire policy of our western neighbours"", Putin added. Per Putin, a solution must be found that satisfies Belarus, European countries, including Poland and Germany and other states, since their social welfare systems actually are under pressure. He expressed hope that direct contacts between the leadership of Belarus and the leaders of major European countries will help solve these problems. The Russian president also commented on Lukashenko's warning that Belarus could stop gas transit if the EU slaps new sanctions on Minsk. ""Frankly speaking, this is the first time I'm hearing of it. I have talked twice to Alexander Grigorievich [Lukashenko] lately, and he never told me that, not even a hint"", he said. In theory, Putin says, Lukashenko can make that decision, but it will break transit contracts and expressed hope that it won't happen. ""...there is nothing good about it, and I will, of course, talk to him on this issue. Unless he just said it in the heat of the moment"", Putin added. Additionally, he mentioned that in 2008 Ukraine used this tactic and blocked Russian gas meant for European users, simply stopping the transit. The migrant crisis has been escalating over the past weeks, as Poland (along with neighbouring Latvia and Lithuania) has reported an influx of migrants trying to cross into the European Union from Belarus and accused Minsk of facilitating illegal migration. Belarus denied those accusations, saying it has no funds to stop the migration due to European sanctions.",russian,1,745,79.05,43.21,28.76,6.39,24.83,28.46,79.46,58.66,47.38,9.53,3.22,0.94,0.54,0,1.34,0.4,6.31,16.11,8.72,0.94,12.35,6.71,3.76,5.1,1.88,12.89,5.37,2.28,6.17,1.34,1.21,3.62,10.2,1.21,8.99,1.61,1.88,1.74,1.07,1.21,2.28,0,4.03,1.21,2.82,1.07,0.4,0.67,0.54,0.13,0,0,9.93,5.1,0.94,0,0.67,0.54,3.09,5.1,0.13,0,0.13,1.34,5.91,3.22,2.55,0.13,1.88,0.13,0.27,1.34,0.13,0,0.4,0.13,0,0,0,0,0.13,0,0,0.54,0.4,0.13,0,0.13,0,0,0.81,0,3.36,10.6,0.27,1.48,7.92,0.54,0.27,0.27,3.89,3.49,4.83,1.21,0,0,0,0,0,15.57,4.43,6.04,0,0,0.94,4.16

War With US? There will be no war between Russia and the United States, at least if it is  up to Russia to decide, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has assured. “If it’s up to the Russian Federation, there will be no war. We do not want  wars. But we won’t allow the West to grossly ignore our interests, either,” Lavrov said, answering a question from Sputnik and RT Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan during his big interview. Discussions regarding the US' formal written response to Russia's security proposals are still ongoing, Lavrov said. “The Western-style responses muddy the waters, but there are rational points there on secondary issues,” he noted. These secondary points include a number of proposals to prevent conflict, deescalate, and engage in confidence-building, and all of them were previously rejected by the US side over the past three years, according to the foreign minister. “In other words, the constructive elements contained in the reply is in fact borrowed from recent Russian initiatives. At least it’s something,” the foreign minister quipped. Lavrov emphasised that Moscow’s security proposals – which include a series of measures aimed at easing tensions between Russia and the Western bloc – as well as a firm demand that Ukraine not be allowed to join NATO, do not constitute an ultimatum, and do not contain any unreasonable requests. The US and its allies have spent months now accusing Russia of plans to ""invade"" Ukraine. Moscow has vocally denied these claims. “We want to be treated honestly,” Lavrov stressed, noting that the  proposals could only be interpreted as unreasonable by someone who wants Russia to simply submit to a situation in which the US and NATO have already swallowed up everything around it. Western ‘Incantations’ About Open Doors In their public remarks on Russia's security proposals, Western officials have repeatedly claimed that Moscow cannot decide for Kiev on what alliances the country can join, citing Organisation for Security Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) agreements. Russia takes a broader, more comprehensive view of these treaties, Lavrov indicated. “In 2010 in Astana, and before that in 1999 in Istanbul, all of the presidents and prime ministers of the OSCE countries signed a package of agreements which contained interrelated principles for ensuring the indivisibility of security. The West pulls out only one phrase from this package – that ‘each country has the right to choose its allies, to choose its military alliances’, but there is also a right stipulating the obligation of each country not to strengthen its security at the expense of the security of others,” the foreign minister said. “The West, in its incantations about the sacrality of NATO’s ‘open-door’  policy, and statements that no one can forbid Ukraine from joining NATO, just deliberately and overtly avoids even referring to this second part of these obligations,” the diplomat stressed. Lavrov informed that Russia is preparing to send its US and NATO colleagues a formal request for clarification later Friday asking them to explain how they are going to fulfil their obligations under the OSCE treaties. “It’s just that their position is based on false arguments, on a direct misinterpretation of the facts, while ours is based on what everyone signed up for. And here I don’t see any room for compromise. Otherwise what is there to negotiate if the West openly sabotages the old  decisions and misinterprets them? This will be a key test for us,” Lavrov summed up. NATO’s ‘Shameful’ Reply NATO also sent a formal written response to Russia's security proposals on Wednesday. Lavrov characterised it as much more ideological than that of the Americans, to the point where Washington’s letter constituted a “model of diplomatic decency” by comparison. “I will mention, in brackets, that the US response, against the background of the document that was sent to us by NATO, constitutes almost a model of diplomatic decency. From NATO the reply was so ideological, reeking so much of the ‘exclusivity’ of the North Atlantic Alliance, ‘its special mission, its special purpose,’ that I was even a little bit ashamed for those who wrote these texts,” Lavrov revealed. Ukraine Tensions Lavrov indicated that when it comes to the Ukraine crisis, Moscow continues to hold to its firm position that Kiev must implement the political portion of the Minsk Agreements, which would end the war in the Donbass, ease regional tensions and serve to guarantee Ukraine’s territorial integrity. “The issue of recognition [of the Donetsk and Lugansk republics] should be considered in the context of our firm position to force the West to push Kiev to implement with the Minsk Agreements. Then everything will be fine,” Lavrov said. The foreign minister believes that only the United States could force Kiev to implement the treaty. President Biden even offered to “help implement” the Minsk agreements at his meeting in Geneva with President Putin last June, Lavrov said. Signed in the Belarusian capital of Minsk in February 2015, the Minsk Agreements called for an immediate ceasefire in the civil conflict in eastern Ukraine, demanded the pullback of forces and heavy weapons from the line of contact, and called on Kiev to implement legal reforms which would grant its eastern regions significant autonomy. The Russian diplomat accused the West of “hysterically inflating” tensions around Ukraine, to the point where even Ukrainian officials themselves have begun trying to pump the breaks. This fearmongering has become so “frank and cynical in its use of Ukraine against Russia that the regime in Kiev has become frightened. They are already saying that there is no need to exacerbate this discussion so much, talking about reducing the rhetoric, asking the West why it is evacuating its diplomats,” Lavrov noted. “By the way, regarding the evacuation: who is evacuating? The Americans and other Anglo-Saxons – the Canadians and the British. That means they know something others don’t,” Lavrov suggested. Moscow may now also need to consider “precautionary measures” for its diplomatic staff “in  anticipation of some provocations,” he said. The Russian diplomat emphasised, however, that he said nothing ""threatening"" regarding Ukraine to his US counterpart Antony Blinken at their recent meeting in Geneva, after which the US side announced its  diplomatic evacuation. “I didn’t tell him anything. I assure you that we discussed only the security guarantees, and after that I raised the completely unacceptable situation regarding our diplomatic missions,” Lavrov said. Washington’s Ukrainian ‘Cossacks in Europe’ The Russian foreign minister accused Washington of “using” Kiev to project American interests in Europe, and stressed that Ukraine’s leaders are always welcome to come to Russia for talks if they want to try to improve bilateral relations. “[Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelensky and his regime are used by the Americans primarily to escalate tension, who use their ‘Cossacks in Europe,’ who play along in every possible way in any Russophobic undertakings. And Washington’s main goal, in this case, is not about  Ukraine’s fate at all. It is important for them to escalate tension around Russia in order to close this matter and move on to China, as American political scientists write,” Lavrov said. He noted that President Zelensky is free to visit Russia if he wants to start a dialogue about normalizing relations, whether these take place in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Sochi or elsewhere. He added however that if the Ukrainian president wants to discuss Donbass, he should speak to the Donbass republics directly through the contact group. “When he says that he won’t talk to them, that’s bad. This is bad for the intra-Ukrainian crisis, and for our relations,” Lavrov stressed. New Warning Regarding New Sanctions New sanctions against Russia would be contrary to the West's own interests, Lavrov indicated. “As far as the threat of sanctions is concerned: The US has been informed in the course of discussions between [Presidents Putin and Biden] that the package of measures which has now been mentioned about the complete shutdown of financial and economic systems controlled by the  West would be considered tantamount to breaking off relations. This was said directly, and I think they understand this,” the Russian foreign minister stressed. “I don’t think that this would be  in anyone’s interests,” he added. Earlier this month, US media reported on the introduction of legislation in Congress aimed at ""collapsing"" the Russian economy, including new restrictions on the Russian banking sector, personal sanctions against military and government officials, prohibiting transactions involving  Russian sovereign debt, and potentially cutting the country off from the  SWIFT interbank transfer system. In a moment of levity during the sanctions discussion, after being informed that the US was “even” considering restrictions against Lavrov personally, the foreign minister quipped: “What do you mean ‘even’ me? What, am I not worthy of sanctions?” Washington’s ‘Boorish’ Behaviour Toward Russian Diplomats Lavrov also discussed difficulties that Russian diplomats have experienced in dealing with their US counterparts in recent years, recalling an undiplomatic incident that took place a couple of years ago, when, in a private conversation, an assistant to then-US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Lavrov’s deputy that Pompeo had mentioned a  scheme to ‘optimize’ the work of diplomats, with the US reportedly considering reducing the terms of service of foreign diplomats to three years. “To the question on why this was being announced on the sly, and whether there were similar deliberations regarding countries besides Russia, we were told ‘no’, that no other countries were considered for such an experiment, only the Russian Federation. It was then that another round of diplomatic head-butting began,” Lavrov revealed. “We warned them that if this kind of boorishness continues, and I can’t  characterise their statements otherwise, that if they didn’t immediately accept our demands for bodyguards for the ambassador, we would ask  [Ambassador Anatoly] Antonov to leave the United States,” he added. Antonov did end up leaving Washington temporarily due to a separate diplomatic flap in March of 2021 over a controversial interview with President Biden to ABC News in which the US leader agreed with the  characterization of President Putin as “a killer” and threatened to make  Moscow “pay a price” for its alleged meddling in US elections. Commenting on the ongoing dispute between Russia and the US regarding diplomatic property and the number of diplomatic personnel stationed in each country, Lavrov promised that a meeting on the matter would be held within the next couple of weeks. “We propose a reset for everything – starting with the ugly and petty move by Nobel laureate [Barack] Obama, to annul everything starting with that move and from what followed,” Lavrov said, referring to the former US president’s decision to kick out 35 Russian diplomats out of the US in late 2016 in response to claims of Russian election meddling. Ties With Latin America Lavrov stressed that Moscow would continue to engage with and build relations with Latin American nations, no matter how the talks with the West on Russia’s security proposals turn out. Characterising Russia’s ties with these countries as “deep,” Lavrov indicated that they “cover economic, humanitarian, educational and sports contacts. They also cover military and military-technical cooperation in full compliance with international law. I can assure you that no matter how events evolve on the issue of European security, we will progressively build on these relations.” Earlier, US media ramped up fears that Russia might put military bases or even nuclear-tipped missiles in the Western Hemisphere, with these reports prompting US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield to warn that “such an aggressive action against the United States” would elicit “a strong response” from Washington. Navalny Saga Lavrov weighed in on the saga surrounding Alexei Navalny – the Russian opposition vlogger whose alleged poisoning sparked a new escalation of tensions between the West and Moscow in 2020. Moscow, he said, still has a series of unanswered questions regarding the incident. “Firstly, we still haven’t received an answer regarding who flew in for Alexei Navalny [when he was picked up in Siberia and taken to Berlin for treatment], and why…the plane which flew to Omsk for him was I believe ordered a day before he fell sick. Why have there been no  answers to concrete questions asked about this in the Bundestag?” Lavrov said. “There are a lot of interesting elements there,” he noted, pointing out, for example, that Navalny was visited by US intelligence officers during his stay in the Berlin hospital. As for broader Western allegations against Russia regarding Navalny’s alleged “poisoning,” Lavrov said that he believes that “so far… the West has no cause to blame us,” and that the poisoning saga was started artificially as a deliberate provocation. Human Rights Court Spat In recent weeks, the European Court of Human Rights and Russia have engaged in multiple spats on a range of issues, including Moscow's decision to close down human rights NGO ""Memorial,"" the MH17 case, a Ukrainian case about Russia's alleged ""abduction of children"" from the Donbass, and other problems. Lavrov commented on these developments by suggesting that unfortunately, in his estimation, the court has lost its ability to make objective judgements. “Over the past few years, Russia has raised the question of materializing the statutory provision [on a commission of human rights], and there was general agreement to start work on such a commission, as well as a common understanding that we would primarily deal with human rights issues in the Commonwealth of Independent States area, so that we ourselves, all CIS countries, and not some Western structures, like the ECHR, would rule on these subjects. Because the EHCR lost its ability to rely on the principles of justice a long time ago, and politicises its decisions more and more with each passing year, in my opinion,” Lavrov said.",russian,1,2310,88.29,58.11,31.72,7.68,27.5,30.09,82.55,62.51,49.57,10.3,4.46,0.61,1.39,0.13,1.04,1,5.84,15.54,8.35,0.61,16.28,5.24,3.85,4.85,1.26,11.6,5.93,2.55,6.06,1.9,0.52,3.64,10.87,1,9.87,2.21,1.47,1.34,1.56,0.39,2.81,0.04,4.33,1.43,2.81,0.74,0,0.65,0.35,0.09,0,0,14.59,8.14,0.43,1.04,0.65,1.08,4.07,6.19,0,0,0,1.04,7.27,5.89,1.39,0,2.38,0.09,0.04,1.77,0.52,0,0.52,0.22,0.09,0,0,0.04,0,0.09,0.09,0.22,0.26,0.3,0,0.09,0,0.04,1.08,0.3,3.03,9.74,0.65,0.95,7.71,0.17,0,0.39,3.59,4.2,2.9,1.21,0.04,0.04,0,0,0,17.71,3.46,6.28,0.26,0,2.08,5.63

Russia and Ukraine are not holding talks at the moment about an increased volume of Russian coal supplies and the Russian Energy Ministry has not received any official request as of today regarding this issue, Energy Minister Nikolai Shulginov told TASS. Asked whether Ukraine supplied a request to increase coal supplies from Russia, Shulginov replied: ""No."" ""They keep up with their own balance and we keep up with our own balance. We have no definite discussions on this matter,"" he stated. Shulginov also said that there was no decision as of yet regarding Russia’s electricity power supplies to Ukraine. ""We have no decision about supplies to Ukraine,"" the Russian energy minister said. Ukraine resumed electricity import from Russia in the fall of 2019 following a four-year break. However, the Ukrainian energy regulator banned such import again in April of 2020 and later extended the ban on electricity import from Russia and Belarus until November 1, 2021.",russian,1,160,84.59,43.74,15.38,38.3,16,32.5,77.5,51.88,43.13,6.25,4.38,0,2.5,0,0.63,1.25,1.88,13.13,5.63,3.75,15.63,3.13,4.38,6.88,3.75,8.13,1.88,2.5,8.13,2.5,0,5.63,8.75,2.5,6.25,1.25,0,0.63,1.25,0.63,2.5,0,1.25,1.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.88,7.5,0,2.5,0,0,5,4.38,0,0,0,0.63,4.38,0,2.5,1.88,3.13,0,0,3.13,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.63,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.63,4.38,0,0.63,4.38,0,0,0,5,4.38,1.88,0,0,0,0,0,0,18.13,6.25,4.38,0,0,0.63,6.88

Militias in the eastern Ukrainian region broke away from Kiev in the spring of 2014 in the aftermath of a Western-backed coup in Kiev. The seven-year war has killed 13,400 people and displaced millions more. Ukraine’s deployment of its Turkish unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is being carried out solely for defensive purposes, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has claimed. “Ukraine protects its territory and its sovereignty in accordance with the duty and oath of everyone who serves today, who defends Ukrainian statehood. We are not executing an offensive, we are just responding,” Zelensky said, speaking to local media on Friday. His comments were published on the president’s website. “When the Ukrainian army feels the need to defend its land, it does so. And it will further act under this principle,” the president warned. Zelensky’s comments follow the publication of a video by the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces on Tuesday showing what it said was the first-ever combat deployment of one of its Bayraktar TB2 drones to destroy a D-30 howitzer battery used by “Russian terrorist forces” [sic] that was supposedly shelling Ukrainian forces.  Ukraine acquired 12 Bayraktar drones from Turkey in 2019, and in April 2021 the two countries announced the creation of a joint venture to produce 48 more of the UAVs. Russia, one of the guarantors of the Minsk ceasefire agreements alongside Germany, France, and Ukraine has expressed concern over the use of combat drones by Kiev, pointing out that doing so is illegal under the terms of the Donbass ceasefire. On Wednesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters that Moscow was “double-checking” information regarding the drones’ deployment, and suggested that their reported use “should certainly make all those who indulge Ukraine’s capricious demands that it be admitted to NATO tomorrow think twice.” The US Embassy in Kiev defended the drones’ deployment, releasing a statement on Friday blaming “the side supported by Russia” for repeatedly using howitzer artillery and drones against Ukrainian forces and killing a Ukrainian serviceman. On Thursday, Laura Cooper, assistant secretary of defence for Russian, Ukrainian and Eurasian affairs, called on Washington’s allies to take an example from Turkey and lift restrictions on the delivery of lethal weapons to Ukraine. The war in Donbass began in the spring of 2014, after US and European Union-backed political forces ousted Ukraine's unpopular but democratically-elected president Viktor Yanukovych in a coup in February of that year. The crisis led to the spontaneous formation self-defence militias of local residents in Donbass’ Donetsk and Lugansk regions concerned with the new authorities’ threats against the country’s Russian-speaking minority. These forces began making demands for regional autonomy, with some calling for the creation of separate states. Kiev responded with military force, and the conflict raged throughout the summer, fall and winter of 2014-2015, killing tens of thousands of people and prompting nearly 2.5 million residents to flee their homes (as many as one million of them to Russia, where they were accepted as refugees). The conflict was frozen thanks to ceasefire negotiations in Minsk, Belarus in February 2015, and the Minsk protocols provided a mechanism through which Kiev could restore its control over the rebellious territories while providing the latter with constitutionally-guaranteed autonomy status. The ceasefire’s provisions, and agreements reached since ban the deployment and use of weapons in and near settlements, as well as offensive, reconnaissance and sabotage mission activities, and the use of drones, in the conflict area. Turkey has shipped its Baryaktar TB2 drones to nearly half-a-dozen countries, including Ukraine, the Tripoli-based Libyan government, Azerbaijan, Morocco, and Qatar. Poland has ordered 24 of the drones, with the first batch expected to be delivered next year. Azerbaijan used the combat drones heavily against Armenian self-defence forces during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, with the UAVs inflicting heavy losses against Armenian defenders. As many as 7,000 people were killed and more than 140,000 were displaced in the conflict, which was halted after the deployment of about 2,000 Russian peacekeepers to separate the two sides.",russian,1,687,97.85,51.34,21.8,1,27.48,34.79,76.86,51.67,44.54,5.09,1.6,0,0.44,0,0.15,0.58,3.49,15.57,9.75,4.66,17.18,3.78,1.89,5.82,0.15,8.15,3.49,3.35,8.73,0.58,0.29,7.86,7.42,0.29,6.99,0.73,3.49,0.44,0.44,0.15,1.6,0,5.24,0.73,4.37,0.58,0,0.44,0,0.44,0,0,7.86,4.8,0.44,0.29,1.75,0.58,1.89,3.2,0,0,0,0.15,7.71,4.8,2.62,0.29,1.89,0,0.44,1.46,0,0,0.87,0.15,0,0.15,0,0,0,0,0.73,0.29,0,0.73,0,0,0,0,0.73,0.29,1.46,8.73,0.44,0.73,7.28,0.29,0,0.44,4.08,4.08,1.6,0.44,0,0,0,0,0,17.18,3.78,6.55,0,0,1.75,5.09

Secretary of State Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley stated on 28 January that a military standoff over Ukraine is not inevitable and that ""a diplomatic outcome is the way to go here"". Nevertheless, US President Joe Biden announced on Friday that he would dispatch American military personnel to NATO allies in Eastern Europe in the ""near term"", with 8,500 US troops having been placed on alert earlier this week. Moscow has repeatedly shredded the ""invasion scare"" peddled by the US and its NATO allies as nonsensical. 'Current Crisis Over Ukraine is Result of US-Backed 2014 Coup' The position of the United States government on Russia and Ukraine is ""certifiably insane"", according to former US Senate candidate and investigative journalist Mark Dankof. Per Dankof, the recent East European crisis can be ""boiled it down"" to the three essential facts: · First, the US lied to then-Soviet leader Gorbachev when it promised not to recruit ex-Soviet republics for NATO membership, or to move American and NATO military assets and exercises closer to Russia's borders. · Second, ""the current crisis over Ukraine is the direct result of an illegal American and EU coup d'etat in Kiev in February of 2014 which overthrew the legally elected government there."" · Third, ""the United States has absolutely no true national security interest in meddling in what is none of our business in Russia's backyard"". Meanwhile, Washington's attempt to simultaneously ""hold a dagger at Russia, Iran, and China's throats"" in their respective backyards is dangerous for the US, which is overstretching itself, according to the investigative journalist. What's Behind US Politicians' Calls for War? However, the bottom line of the bellicose American rhetoric is that it is fanned by influential neo-conservative NGOs and is generously sponsored by US defence contractors, Dankof notes. To illustrate his point, the investigative journalist refers to a 20 January Washington Post op-ed written by Michael Vickers, ex-American undersecretary of defence for intelligence and a former special forces and CIA operations officer. Vickers advocated moving US combat aircraft and ships forward to Europe to deter Russia. If Moscow does not back down and invades Ukraine, the ""US strategy should shift to deterrence by punishment"", according to the former CIA operations officer. Vickers insists that the ""punishment"" should be broader than tough anti-Russia sanctions, and include fomenting a guerrilla war against the Russians in Ukraine; stepping up the resistance to Alexander Lukashenko in Belarus; and ""employ[ing] cyber and other covert means to undermine Putin’s rule in Russia"". ""The Post failed to mention that Vickers is on the Board of Directors of the British BAE Systems, the largest weapons company in Europe, and whose stock value rose 10% in this crisis"", remarks Mark Dankof. US Senator Roger Wicker from Mississippi in early December 2021 discussed the idea of a preventive nuclear action against Russia in case of escalation in the Ukrainian internal crisis. The senator came under heavy criticism from both sides of the US political spectrum for his remarks. However, Wicker has long been advocating for a US ""muscular foreign policy"", apparently appeasing US defence contractors such as Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, and General Atomics, which have offices in his state. This club is joined by Republican Congressman Michael R. Turner of Ohio's 10th Congressional District, which includes Dayton's Wright Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB), according to Dankof. Earlier this month, Turner, the new top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, urged Biden to step up military and intelligence support for Ukraine. It's not only Republicans who are beating the drums of war: Democratic Representative Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) and ex-Obama administration official Evelyn Farkas called on Joe Biden to ""impose military costs"" on Moscow and ""use our military to roll back Russians"", as Jacobin staff writer Branko Marcetic remarked in his latest op-ed for the WaPo. This bipartisan interventionist consensus is ""all about maintaining the supremacy of the Western central banking system, the American petrodollar, the profits of armaments manufacturers"", according to Dankof. ""There is no dialogue, only a pack of lies backed by military deployments and threats, economic sanctions and blackmail, black operational subversions in these countries, all couched in diplomatic language and the Orwellian use of terms like 'democracy', 'human rights', and 'negotiations'"", he says. Zelensky Realises That the West's Alarmism Harms Ukraine Meanwhile, the Ukrainian leadership appears to have become weary of the US-backed hysteria, especially as the US president and NATO chief made it clear that they would not be directly involved in a potential Russo-Ukrainian standoff. ""There are signals even from respected leaders of states, they just say that tomorrow there will be war. This is panic - how much does it cost for our state?"" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky told a press conference on 28 January, stressing that he did not see a greater threat now than during a similar concentration of Russian troops last spring. According to Zelensky, the ""destabilisation of the situation"" inside Ukraine poses a far bigger threat. Speaking to the BBC earlier this month, Ukraine’s Security Council chief Oleksiy Danilov noted that Western allies are fuelling panic which by no means benefits Ukraine. Danilov suggested that alarmist statements made by the US and NATO leaders were prompted by domestic and geopolitical interests. ""Perhaps Zelensky realises that he's in over his head in this"", says Dankof. ""The European members of NATO need to reflect on their respective situations as well. Their own innocent populations will be the first to be hit en masse. For what? Joe Biden? Lloyd Austin? Michael Vickers? Mike Turner?""",russian,1,970,91.5,58.47,23.42,4.73,23.1,32.78,77.22,54.02,42.99,7.32,3.09,0,1.44,0,0.93,0.52,4.23,12.47,7.22,1.55,14.85,5.15,2.37,4.64,1.03,8.66,7.11,2.27,9.59,2.47,0.41,6.6,8.25,0.52,7.73,1.13,1.34,0.72,0.72,0.62,2.89,0,4.43,1.24,3.2,0.62,0,0.62,0.41,0.1,0,0,10.72,5.15,0.72,0.21,0.72,0.52,2.16,5.57,0,0.1,0,0.93,9.07,7.32,1.55,0.21,5.05,0.1,0.31,4.12,0.93,0,0.31,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.72,0,0,0,0,0.1,0.31,1.44,0.1,1.65,9.48,0.62,0.82,7.53,0.52,0,0.21,3.4,2.58,4.23,0.41,0.31,0.21,0.1,0,0,19.48,3.61,5.67,0.72,0,2.47,7.01
