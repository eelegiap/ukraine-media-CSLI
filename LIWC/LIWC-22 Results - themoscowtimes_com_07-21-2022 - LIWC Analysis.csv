Kiev slammed as “political” this week’s contract that will supply 4.5 billion cubic meters of Russian natural gas to Hungary every year until 2036 through non-Ukrainian transit routes. “Gazprom stopped gas transit through Ukraine to Hungary,” Yuri Vitrenko, the CEO of Ukraine’s pipeline operator Naftogaz, wrote on Facebook. Vitrenko accused Gazprom of using gas exports as a “weapon” and said the Hungary deal “clearly demonstrates” its intent after Russia launches another pipeline that bypasses Ukraine to deliver gas to Germany, Nord Stream 2. “A joint statement from the United States and Germany indicates that in case of the Kremlin using gas as a weapon, there should be an appropriate reaction,” he said, referring to a U.S.-German deal in July that would threaten Russia with sanctions and extend gas transit through Ukraine. “We are now waiting for sanctions imposed on a 100% subsidiary of Gazprom, the Nord Stream 2 operator,” the Naftogaz CEO said. Gazprom and the Kremlin have dismissed Ukraine’s concerns about the loss of its role as a transit provider. Russia and Gazprom have also maintained that the $12-billion Nord Stream 2 would increase the stability of Russian gas supplies to Europe. Ukraine’s accusations come amid calls by European parliamentarians to investigate possible market manipulation by Gazprom amid record-high gas prices in Europe. The EU lawmakers claim that the company refuses to export gas to exert pressure on Europe as Nord Stream 2 awaits certification by German regulators after its recent completion. The Kremlin says Russia is fulfilling its gas export obligations under existing contracts and denies that it is attempting to speed up the Nord Stream 2 approval process through natural gas export manipulation. Ukraine makes around $3 billion a year by transiting Russian gas to Europe — a commercial relationship which has persisted despite the ongoing war between Russian-backed separatists in the Donbass and Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.",1,344,97.33,45.22,6.76,4.42,28.67,35.17,68.02,46.51,38.08,5.52,0.58,0,0.29,0,0.29,0,4.94,12.5,7.56,3.78,17.15,3.2,1.74,5.23,0,7.27,2.62,2.62,6.69,0.58,0.87,5.23,6.1,0.29,5.81,0.29,2.03,1.16,0.29,0.29,1.16,0,2.62,0.29,2.33,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.1,4.07,0,0,1.16,0.58,1.74,1.74,0,0,0,0.29,5.23,3.2,2.03,0,4.94,0,0,3.49,1.16,0.29,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.29,0.29,0,0.58,0,0,0.87,0,2.33,6.1,0.29,0.87,5.23,0,0,0,3.78,1.74,2.91,0.58,0,0,0,0,0,14.83,4.36,2.62,0,0,2.03,5.81

Viktor Bryukhanov was the plant’s first and only director during its years of operation, having also managed the construction of the Chernobyl nuclear station from 1970 to 1977. Bryukhanov was fired within weeks of the April 1986 explosion. Authorities in Soviet Ukraine sentenced him to 10 years in prison on charges of safety violations. He was released after he had served half of his jail term. The Chernobyl nuclear power station’s press service announced Bryukhanov’s passing on its Facebook page Wednesday. It did not indicate a cause of death. “The plant team and administration express their deepest condolences to the family and friends of the deceased,” it said. Bryukhanov was famously portrayed by Con O’Neill in HBO’s critically acclaimed 2019 “Chernobyl” miniseries, which documented the aftermath of the nuclear accident and the Soviet-era mismanagement of the response efforts. The April 1986 explosion at the Chernobyl power plant in Soviet Ukraine spread radioactive material across much of the Northern Hemisphere, affecting tens of thousands of people. Secret documents declassified by Ukraine earlier this year showed Bryukhanov’s first post-disaster report assured the authorities that radiation levels following the meltdown were “under control.” Born in Soviet Uzbekistan on Dec. 1, 1935, Bryukhanov relocated to Ukraine, also part of the U.S.S.R., in 1966 after graduating with an electrical engineering degree from the Tashkent Polytechnic Institute and working at the country’s thermal power plant.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has offered to meet Putin to discuss the return of annexed Crimea and resolve the seven-year conflict with pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine. But the Kremlin has rebuffed Zelenskiy’s request, refusing to negotiate the status of Crimea and saying that two sides’ agendas for a face-to-face meeting do not align. Writing in the Kommersant business daily, Medvedev criticized Zelenskiy as “weak,” “ignorant” and “unreliable” — without referring to him by name — and attacked the country’s “complete dependence” on the United States. “How can you negotiate and strike deals with him?” wrote Medvedev, who was demoted last year from the post of prime minister to the newly created position of deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council. “It’s pointless for us to deal with vassals.” Medvedev also accused the Ukrainian leader of working with neo-Nazi and fascist groups, and made references to Zelenskiy’s Jewish roots. Medvedev slammed the Ukrainian president for “serving the most rabid nationalist forces in Ukraine” and warned that “at some point, when the political situation changes, they’ll sew a yellow star on your back.” Russia has for years criticized what it sees as a powerful fascist element behind various anti-Russia policies and movements in Ukraine. “Appeasing these attitudes clearly disgusts him, since his and his family’s whole history stands against such vileness,” Medvedev said. “But, alas, he has to. Otherwise, they’ll smear his brains against the wall. So he is forced to preach their ideology.” The former prime minister recommended Moscow wait for “sane” figures to replace Zelenskiy and other Ukrainian leaders before the Kremlin considers opening negotiations. “Russia knows how to wait. We are patient people,” Medvedev wrote. The Kremlin said later Monday that Medvedev’s article “runs in unison” with Russia’s view of the current Ukrainian government.",1,327,92.83,70.26,24.81,2.23,18.17,37.92,78.29,53.82,41.9,7.03,4.89,0,0.61,0.61,2.45,0.92,2.14,11.93,7.34,0.61,15.9,3.98,2.45,6.42,0.61,10.4,5.5,2.14,8.26,0.92,0.61,6.73,9.17,0,9.17,1.83,2.45,0.61,0,0.31,4.28,0,4.59,0.92,3.67,0.31,0,0.31,0,0,0,0,18.04,8.87,0.31,0.31,1.83,0.61,4.89,8.87,0.31,0,0,2.45,6.73,4.59,2.14,0,6.12,0,0,5.5,0.31,0.61,0.92,0.61,0,0,0.31,0,0,0,0,0.61,0,0,0,0.31,0,0,0.92,0.31,1.83,7.03,0.31,1.22,4.89,0.92,0,0,5.2,3.98,3.67,1.22,0,0,0,0,0,24.16,5.2,4.28,0.31,0,3.67,10.7

Moscow said President Vladimir Putin, his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel instructed the ministers to work toward a meeting during a joint telephone call Monday. According to the Kremlin, it would take place within the framework of the ""Normandy Four"" — which usually brings together officials from Moscow and Kiev under the mediation of Paris and Berlin. The Kremlin did not say in its statement if Ukraine would take part in the meeting. However France's presidency said that it should involve Ukraine. The presidency also said in a statement that Macron and Merkel held a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy before speaking to Putin. Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert also confirmed the plans for the meeting, for which a date has not yet been set. The Kremlin said the leaders had instructed their foreign ministers to ""intensify their contacts and work"" after a ""difficult"" situation in eastern Ukraine. The leaders also agreed to consider organizing a summit, the Russian and German statements said. During the phone call, Putin accused the Kiev authorities of ""stubbornly evading"" fulfilling agreements reached at peace talks. France and Germany have been mediators in the conflict between Kiev and pro-Moscow separatists since 2015 in the so-called Normandy format and have been overseeing a fragile ceasefire. Angela Merkel visited both Moscow and Kiev in August. Afterward, she then expressed her hope that peace talks on the conflict between Kiev and pro-Russia separatists would continue after she left power. The Ukrainian army is locked in a simmering conflict with breakaway fighters in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions that erupted after Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014. The conflict has claimed more than 13,000 lives. Ukraine and its Western allies accuse Russia of sending troops and arms to support the separatists, which Moscow denies. The European Union on Monday imposed sanctions on eight more officials accused of targeting opponents of Russia's seizure of Crimea, ahead of a visit to Kiev by the bloc's top officials.

Clashes have regularly broken out in the east in recent weeks, undermining a ceasefire brokered last year that had raised hopes of ending a conflict that erupted in 2014 after Russia annexed Crimea. The Ukrainian army said that one serviceman was killed on Saturday when separatist fighters opened fire with small arms, while another soldier ""received a gunshot bullet wound incompatible with life"" on Monday. The fresh clashes come as Russia has massed thousands of its soldiers on its border with Ukraine, with the White House last week saying the number of Russian troops at the border was now greater than at any time since 2014. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's spokeswoman told AFP on Monday that Russia now has 41,000 troops on Ukraine's eastern border and 42,000 soldiers on the Crimean peninsula. Spokeswoman Yulia Mendel also said that Zelenskiy had sent a query to the Kremlin in late March requesting talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin over the escalating conflict, but was yet to receive an answer. ""We hope that President Vladimir Putin does not refuse dialogue,"" Mendel told AFP. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, however, denied that Moscow had received a request for talks. ""I am not aware of any such enquiries in recent days,"" he told reporters on Monday. The Kremlin, which has not denied the troop movements, has said it is not moving towards war with Ukraine, but also that it ""will not remain indifferent"" to the fate of Russian speakers in the east. The conflict, which has claimed more than 13,000 lives, has seen 28 Ukrainian soldiers killed since the start of the year compared to 50 in all of 2020.

Witnesses filmed around 30 unknown individuals barging into the office of Memorial, a group which documents Soviet-era repressions and victims of Josef Stalin’s Great Terror, shouting “fascists,” “shame” and telling viewers to leave because “the screening is over.” When police later appeared, they handcuffed the entrance doors to Memorial’s office and locked its staff and attendees inside for several hours, the group’s lawyer said. They also dismantled the office’s fire alarm system and took away a video recording device, the independent Novaya Gazeta paper reported. The film being shown was Polish director Agnieszka Holland’s “Mr. Jones,” released in 2019. It tells the story of Welsh journalist Gareth Jones, one of the first Western journalists to report on the 1932-33 Ukrainian famine, known as the Holodomor. “Of course [the attack] was against Memorial and not the film,” Memorial spokeswoman Natalia Petrova told Reuters. “The film was just a pretext,” she added. Russian authorities have for years attempted to thwart Memorial’s work, activists say, including through fines and searches of their premises across the country. Several Memorial activists have been imprisoned on what the group says are politically motivated charges, including Oyub Titiev, head of Memorial’s office in Chechnya and Yury Dmitriyev, head of its Karelian branch. Scholars estimate between 4-7.5 million people were killed in the Holodomor, a man-made disaster that Kiev and a handful of other countries have declared a genocide. Moscow has rejected those assertions and interpretation of the causes of the famine has remained a wedge between the two countries. The screening of “Mr. Jones” comes at a sensitive time for relations between Russia and Ukraine, amid the protracted war between Ukrainian government forces and pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine. Memorial lawyer Natalia Morozova accused police of allowing most of the men who had stormed the group's offices to leave without being questioned. They “didn’t show much zeal to detain even those who they managed to catch,” Morozova told the RBC news website. She added that police conducted lengthy interrogations of viewers and Memorial staff, forcing them to stay inside and provide detailed written statements. Lawyers were only allowed inside around midnight — four hours after the disruption — with staff and police on site until at least 1 a.m. Moscow time. Russian authorities labeled Memorial a foreign agent in 2014. The designation imposes onerous financial auditing requirements on the group and forces it to add public disclaimers declaring itself a “foreign agent” to every one of its publications. The organization was founded in the final years of the Soviet Union, during a period of openness ushered in by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbochev.",1,482,98.24,66.85,20.02,4.26,22.95,32.57,80.91,52.28,43.57,4.77,2.07,0,0,0,0.41,1.24,2.7,15.15,10.58,3.11,16.6,3.73,2.07,4.77,0.41,8.09,4.15,4.56,7.26,0.21,0.83,6.43,5.81,0.21,5.6,0.83,1.66,0,0.62,0.41,1.87,0,2.9,0.41,2.49,0.41,0,0.41,0.21,0,0,0,13.28,6.64,0,0.41,1.45,0.83,3.32,6.85,0,0,0.62,0.83,3.32,1.24,1.87,0.21,6.43,1.04,0,4.77,0.62,0,3.11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.7,0.21,0,0.41,0.62,0,0,0,0,0,2.07,9.54,0.41,0.83,7.26,0.83,0.21,0.21,3.11,4.98,1.66,0,0,0,0,0,0,17.22,5.19,4.77,0,0,1.87,5.39

The latest step pushing the Baltic Sea pipeline to completion comes as Europe faces an energy crisis with natural gas reserves at a low level and energy prices surging. ""The gas-in procedure for the first string of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline has started,"" Nord Stream 2 AG said in a statement. ""This string will be gradually filled to build the required inventory and pressure as a prerequisite for the later technical tests,"" said the Switzerland-based company, which is owned by a subsidiary of Russian gas giant Gazprom. It said it would publish more information about ""further technical steps in due time."" Nord Stream 2 has for years divided European capitals and raised tensions between the bloc and Washington. The pipeline diverts supplies from an existing route through Ukraine and is expected to deprive Europe's ally of an estimated 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) annually in transit fees from Russia. Ukraine — in conflict with Russia since Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea — has warned Europe that Nord Stream 2 could be used by Moscow to exert pressure. The United States has reluctantly signed off on the project, but says it will sanction Moscow if the pipeline is used as a weapon. ""We continue to oppose this pipeline,"" U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said on Monday. ""We continue to believe it is a geopolitical project of the Russian Federation and we will continue to apply the law consistent with our periodic reviews which, of course, remain ongoing."" When Gazprom announced last month that construction was complete, Kiev vowed to continue lobbying against the project ""even after the gas is turned on."" Gas prices in Europe around the same time were skyrocketing in anticipation of higher winter demand and the International Energy Agency urged Russia open the taps. Moscow has said that it is waiting for Nord Stream 2 to come online before delivering more gas, but said the pipeline would help combat surging gas prices in Europe. Running from Russia's Baltic coast to northeastern Germany, the underwater, 1,200-kilometer (745-mile) pipeline follows the same route as Nord Stream 1, which was completed over a decade ago. Like its twin, Nord Stream 2 will be able to pipe 55 billion cubic meters of gas per year to Europe, increasing the continent's access to relatively cheap natural gas at a time of falling domestic production. Germany, Europe's top economy, imports around 40% of its gas from Russia, and Berlin believes the pipeline has a role to play in the country's transition away from coal and nuclear energy.",1,457,97.51,41.36,40.89,9.65,26.88,26.48,73.96,53.83,41.14,4.38,0.88,0,0.88,0,0,0,3.5,12.47,9.19,4.38,16.63,5.69,1.75,4.6,0,10.72,5.69,5.03,2.63,1.31,0.22,1.09,5.47,0,5.47,0.88,0.88,0.66,0.44,0.44,2.19,0,2.19,0.44,1.53,0.22,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.03,3.72,0.44,0,0.66,0,2.41,1.53,0,0.22,0,0.22,3.06,1.53,0.66,0.88,5.03,0.22,0,3.06,1.75,0,0.22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.44,0,0.22,0.22,0.88,0,0,0.66,0,2.41,8.53,0.22,2.19,6.78,0,0,0.22,5.47,4.6,3.72,1.31,0,0,0,0,0,14.44,4.38,3.94,0,0,1.31,4.81

""The decision to withdraw the accreditation of eight members of the Russian delegation to NATO was done based on intelligence because these are undeclared Russian intelligence officers,"" Stoltenberg said. ""We have seen an increase in Russian malign activities, at least in Europe and therefore we need to act."" The NATO chief said that the decision to kick out the Russian representatives was not ""linked to any particular event"" — but gave no more details over the move. NATO announced Wednesday it had decided to strip the ""undeclared Russian intelligence officers"" of official accreditation to the alliance and halve the size of the Russian delegation to 10. Stoltenberg reiterated that the ""relationship between NATO and Russia is at its lowest point since the end of the Cold War. And that's because of the Russian behavior."" Ties between the West and Moscow have slumped in recent years since the Kremlin's 2014 annexation of Crimea and over its involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Russia has long had an observer mission to NATO as part of a two-decade-old NATO-Russia Council meant to promote cooperation in common security areas, but it is not a member of the U.S.-led Alliance. The Kremlin said earlier Thursday that the expulsions showed NATO members have no desire to normalise relations with Moscow. ""There is an obvious contradiction in the statements of NATO representatives about the desire to normalise relations with our country and in real actions,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. The Russian mission has been downsized once before, when seven of its members were ejected after the 2018 poisoning by the Novichok nerve agent on a Russian former double agent, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter in Britain. Accreditation applications by another three Russian diplomats were denied. Meetings of a NATO-Russia council have not been held since 2019 against the backdrop of the heightened tensions. ""We are ready to engage in meaningful dialogue with with Russia, and we are ready also to convene a NATO-Russia Council meeting,"" Stoltenberg said. ""We have actually invited Russia for a long time. So far, Russia has not responded positively."" Sky News reported that NATO's decision came after information was revealed in April about fatal explosions at a Czech ammunition depot in 2014 that Prague says involved two Russian spies — identified as allegedly implicated in the Skripal poisoning. That Czech Republic-Russia incident led to the mutual expulsion of dozens of EU and Russian diplomats and other embassy staff.",1,433,95.95,57.95,34.57,12.9,22.79,32.79,82.22,57.51,46.19,4.85,1.62,0,1.39,0,0.23,0,3.23,15.47,9.47,2.54,17.55,6,2.08,6.24,1.39,11.32,5.54,3.7,7.62,4.16,0.23,3.23,10.62,0.46,10.16,2.31,2.31,0.69,0.69,0.92,3,0,3.93,1.39,2.08,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.55,5.08,1.15,0,0.23,0,3,6,0.23,0,0.23,0.46,8.08,4.62,3.46,0,4.39,0,0,4.39,0,0,0.92,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.23,0.69,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,0.23,0,3.7,8.78,0,1.15,6,0.92,0.23,0.46,4.39,7.39,2.54,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,13.86,4.85,2.31,0,0,0.92,5.77
8,themoscowtimes.com,1633330800,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/10/04/merkels-legacy-as-seen-from-russia-a75202,"Merkel Legacy , as Seen From Russia - The Moscow Times",English,Russia,"Angela Merkel’s sixteen years as German chancellor have shaped Berlin’s place and role in Europe and in the twenty-first-century world at large. Her legacy will live on long after she steps down from the leadership. While firmly embedded within the European Union, Germany has essentially become its sole, though by no means, absolute leader. It is a peaceful champion of a soft European version of liberalism. Vocal support for values does not, however, translate into interventionism. Nor does it prevent Germany from pursuing its business interests or waging a pragmatic foreign policy — within the limits of the EU/NATO framework. Merkel’s leadership was almost always steady and dependable, and her policies were largely predictable. True, neither Germany within the EU nor the EU within the U.S.-led system have achieved strategic autonomy on her watch, but that was hardly Merkel’s objective. Viewed from Moscow, Merkel’s legacy can be summarized as follows: reconfirmation of Germany’s Atlanticist orientation; achievement of a primus inter pares position within the European Union; and distancing from Russia, while keeping in touch with it. In 2005, Merkel succeeded Gerhard Schroeder, the Social Democratic leader who took over from Helmut Kohl as a result of the 1998 election. Under Schroeder, newly reunified Germany’s ambition to play a more autonomous role in world affairs reached its peak. In 2003, Berlin, Paris, and Moscow had even formed a new entente, as Russia’s then foreign minister Igor Ivanov called it, to oppose the U.S. invasion of Iraq and potentially act as a counterweight to Washington. The vision of a greater Europe from the Atlantic to the Pacific based on the marriage between the German/European industry and Russian resources was just about to take shape. Merkel, a former East German citizen, faced the need to be accepted by Germany’s largely Atlanticist political elite, as well as by Berlin’s principal allies in Washington. Mending strained ties with the United States became a priority for her, and she worked hard on it. Merkel succeeded, and in return, she got American support for Germany’s leading role in Europe, albeit within the general framework of U.S. global leadership. This did not mean Germany blindly following the United States at every turn: in 2008, Merkel refused to accept George W. Bush’s bid to include Ukraine and Georgia in NATO, and in 2010, Germany took no part in the NATO military operation in Libya, even abstaining at the relevant UN Security Council vote alongside China, India, and Russia. At the same time, Merkel did not allow the embarrassing public scandal over U.S. intelligence tapping her cell phone to get out of hand. During the Donald Trump years, Merkel — who did not get along too well with the forty-fifth U.S. president — rose to become the de facto temporary leader of the liberal West. That unanimous and apparently natural choice of the vast majority of European and American elites was recognition of the national prestige of both Merkel personally and Germany, and of their clear evocation of democratic values and the practice of liberal policies. Merkel’s informal tenure as leader of the West ended with the election of Joe Biden, but with Britain’s departure from the European Union following the 2016 referendum, Germany’s position as Washington’s principal ally within the EU had been elevated even higher. This is the main element of Angela Merkel’s legacy. When Merkel first became chancellor, Germany usually worked in tandem with France within the EU. Over time, Berlin rose to a position of preeminence, de facto making Paris its junior associate. During her tenure, Merkel worked with four French presidents: Jacques Chirac, Nicolas Sarkozy, François Hollande, and Emmanuel Macron. With every change of command at the Élysée Palace, the German chancellor appeared to stand taller. The appointment of her ally Ursula von der Leyen as president of the European Commission was a sign of the influence of both Germany and Merkel. To achieve that position, Germany had to manage major EU expansion, the debt crisis, and Brexit. Merkel did well on all three. Her only major failure was the immigration crisis of 2015, but once the negative consequences of the massive influx of migrants became apparent, she worked hard to stem the inflow and limit the damage. Berlin’s single leadership had to be accepted by its European partners, including those who were historically fearful of Berlin’s diktat. Particularly important in this regard were Germany’s eastern neighbors, Poland and the Baltic states, which were historically allergic to anything that might look like a reborn German Reich or any form of German-Russian collusion. To get their backing, Berlin had to take account of those countries’ special interests. It should be added, though, that German business gained much from the expansion of the EU to integrate Eastern European countries. Angela Merkel was the first German chancellor to speak Russian fluently, but this did not lead to a closer relationship with Moscow. In fact, the relationship grew markedly more distant, for several reasons. One was the reaffirmation of Germany’s Atlanticist credentials, even at a time when Russia’s relations with the United States were rapidly deteriorating. In 2007, Merkel was in the room in Munich when Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered his famous speech in which he lashed out at U.S. global hegemony. Another reason already alluded to was the enlargement of the European Union from 2004 to include a dozen former communist countries. This changed both the complexion of the EU and the balance within it. Many of the new entrants had had painful relations with the Soviet Union and the Russian Empire, or had even been part of the Russian realm in the past, and were still reeling from it. Berlin, which aspired to lead the expanding European Union, could not afford to ignore those sentiments. The EU’s enlargement also turned Eastern European countries into important trading partners and investment opportunities for Germany: far more so than the Russian Federation, which had long dominated Germany’s eastern trade. Finally, as the Cold War receded into the past, the division of Germany and Berlin was overcome, and the country’s physical security was assured, German society started to pay more attention to other issues, primarily environmental and climate-related, and social and political values, including human and minority rights. To the post–Cold War generation of German politicians, Russia was no longer the country that held the key to German reunification; nor were its forces a huge presence in East Germany; nor was it viewed as a land of economic opportunity in the east. Rather, post-Soviet Russia stood for a failing attempt at democratization, a grossly inefficient and primitive oligarchical economy, and an increasingly authoritarian regime led by a former KGB operative who used to work in East Germany. Angela Merkel’s personal relationship with Vladimir Putin was apparently decorous throughout, but never overly close. There was certainly no warmth there, unlike between Putin and Schroeder, or even Boris Yeltsin and Helmut Kohl. However, the German-Russian relationship initially moved forward with economic projects, political consultations, and high-level societal fora like the German-Russian Petersburg Dialogue. There was a moment in mid-2011 when Merkel publicly expressed her preference for Putin’s chosen interim successor, President Dmitry Medvedev. Like then U.S. president Barack Obama, the German chancellor saw Medvedev, in contrast to Putin, as a modernizer and a much more convenient partner for the West. At that time, Merkel and her then vice chancellor and foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier were promoting a modernization partnership with Russia in the hope that modernization would not be limited to technology and the economy — in line with Putin’s idea of a Greater Europe from Lisbon to Vladivostok, which he laid out before the German business community during a 2010 visit — but would also transform the Russian political system and society according to the Western model. In that respect, Berlin’s expectations turned out to be wishful thinking. Major disappointment set in as Putin decided to run for the Russian presidency again. The last seven-plus years of Merkel’s involvement with the Kremlin were marked and marred by the Ukraine crisis, Crimea, and the armed conflict in Donbas. As a result, the post–Cold War German-Russian partnership degenerated into a transactional relationship with increasing mutual criticism and decreasing trust. In Putin’s eyes, Berlin’s connivance with Paris and Warsaw over what the Kremlin regarded as the Maidan coup in Kyiv that toppled the elected president amounted to a massive breach of trust. In turn, Russia’s forceful reaction to the developments in Ukraine stunned Merkel and her colleagues. In vain did Putin appeal to German gratitude for Moscow having turned the key on reunification; Merkel, reflecting the views of not only the German political class, but also much of the public, saw Russia’s actions as changing borders by force and thus upsetting the post–Cold War order in Europe. Merkel took the lead in imposing rafts of EU sanctions on Russia. Unlike other Western leaders, however, Merkel did not respond to the crisis by severing all contact with Moscow in an attempt to “isolate” and thus “punish” Russia. The German chancellor, while being very critical of Russian policies, kept the line of communication to the Kremlin open. In February 2015, Merkel put at stake her own prestige by flying to Minsk for marathon negotiations to broker a ceasefire in Donbas. Since then, much of her interaction with Putin has been devoted to the conflict in Ukraine’s southeast. Her approach could be described as critical dialogue, with both sides trading critical arguments, but also looking for ways and means of managing the standoff. Germany’s critical public attitude toward Russia was not limited to Ukraine-related issues. Starting with the campaign focusing on the “values gap” with Russia and the thrashing of Germany’s own so-called Putin-Versteher, or Putin-empathizers, the criticism was becoming wider and more scathing. Accusations of Russian media meddling in German politics, of Russia’s involvement in the Bundestag hacking, and the murder of a former Chechen rebel commander in Berlin’s central Tiergarten marked a clear downward trend in the relationship. In 2020, Merkel publicly supported a German military laboratory’s findings that Russian anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny, who had been flown from Russia to Germany for emergency medical treatment, had been poisoned with a chemical nerve agent. Merkel herself visited the activist in a Berlin hospital. Symbolically, the Navalny incident closed the book on what had remained of the three-decades-long German-Russian partnership. The partnership may be in the past, but the relationship continues. In 2021, Merkel passed an important test in defending German interests from U.S. pressure. Despite the strained relations with Russia and vehement criticism from the EU’s eastern flank countries such as Poland and the Baltic states, not to mention hysterics from Ukraine, Merkel succeeded in reaching a deal with U.S. President Joe Biden on allowing the completion of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia under the Baltic Sea. Merkel’s unfailing consistency and stubborn determination under enormous pressure, which eventually led to a positive outcome for Germany, was closely watched and appreciated by the Kremlin. It was also appreciated that before leaving office, she made one last visit to Russia. Seen from Moscow, Angela Merkel’s long tenure was a period of relative, if not always palatable, predictability in German-Russian relations. Vladimir Putin often disagreed with the German chancellor, but he undoubtedly respected her. For Russian policymakers, Germany remains the European Union’s key member state. Historically, Moscow’s relations with the major powers have heavily depended on its interaction with the leaders of those powers. The future of the relationship will depend in no small measure on who succeeds her and how skilled that successor is at the art of statecraft. Merkel is leaving behind very big shoes to fill.

After almost all precincts were counted, the ruling Georgian Dream party led with 46.6% of the votes in Saturday's elections, while all of the opposition parties combined garnered 53.4%, official results showed. Critics have denounced a backsliding on democracy in Georgia, saying parliamentary elections held last October were rigged and accusing the ruling party of using criminal prosecutions to punish political opponents and journalists. Under an EU-brokered inter-party agreement in May, Georgian Dream had pledged to hold snap parliamentary elections if it won less than 43% of the municipal vote. But it unilaterally withdrew from the pact in July, sparking harsh criticism from the West, and Saturday's result frees them from the obligation to call snap polls. Georgian Dream said in a statement that the closely-watched elections ""were held at the highest democratic standards."" But opposition parties said Sunday widespread irregularities undermined the credibility of the elections, held in a tense atmosphere after Saakashvili, the country's foremost opposition leader and former president, was arrested on return from exile. ""The election results were falsified. We have witnessed intimidation and bribing of voters prior to the elections, multiple voting on the election day,"" Giorgi Baramidze, a leader of Saakashvili's United National Movement (UNM), told AFP. ""The elections' credibility has already been undermined by the fact that the leader of the opposition was first forced into exile and then arrested,"" he said referring to Saakashvili. ""We will use all the legal means to reverse the falsification."" Badri Japaridze, a leader of opposition Lelo party, said: ""The elections were marred by large-scale intimidation and bribing of voters, seriously affecting the electoral results."" In a number of major cities — including the capital Tbilisi — second round runoffs will have to be held on October 30 between mayoral candidates from the Georgian Dream and the UNM, the country's main opposition force. Saakashvili, 53, secretly returned to Georgia on Friday from Ukraine — where he heads a government agency steering reforms — ahead of the elections and was quickly detained for alleged abuse of office. The flamboyant pro-Western reformer and president in 2004-2013, denied any wrongdoing, denounced a six-year jail sentence in absentia as politically motivated and went on hunger strike following his arrest. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday he will be pressing for Saakashvili's return to Ukraine as he is a Ukrainian national and was stripped of his Georgian passport. Saakashvili's jailing aggravated the political crisis that engulfed Georgia last October when opposition parties denounced parliamentary elections as rigged, refused to take up their seats in the newly elected legislature and staged mass protests to demand snap polls. Prior to his arrest, Saakashvili had called on supporters to take to the streets ""to protect election results."" But opposition parties have so far refrained from staging protests, awaiting the conclusions from international monitors who are due to present their assessment later on Sunday. The United States has hinted at possible sanctions against Georgian officials over the country's backsliding on democracy. In comments to AFP through a representative, who visited him in prison on Saturday, Saakashvili said he returned to Georgia despite looming arrest ""to fight to the end against the oligarchic rule which kills Georgian democracy."" He was referring to former prime minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, a powerful oligarch and ruling party founder who is widely believed to be calling the shots in Georgia despite holding no political office.",1,589,97.63,57.28,17.98,1,26.77,37.52,79.63,52.29,41.26,4.07,3.06,0,0.34,0,1.7,0.51,1.02,12.05,9.17,1.53,16.47,4.92,1.7,5.09,0.17,11.21,4.58,2.04,14.94,1.87,0.51,12.73,6.96,0.68,6.28,0.51,2.21,0,1.02,0.17,2.21,0,5.94,1.19,4.75,0.34,0,0.34,0.17,0.17,0,0,12.39,7.3,0,0,3.06,0.68,2.04,4.92,0,0,0,1.7,9.85,9.51,0.34,0,2.89,1.02,0,1.87,0,0,0.51,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.17,0.17,0.85,0,0.34,0.17,0,0,0.17,0.68,0,2.21,6.28,0,1.02,5.6,0.17,0,0.17,5.43,7.81,1.19,1.36,0,0,0,0,0,15.79,4.07,5.09,0,0,1.87,4.75

Russia's population has been in near-constant decline since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, due to a low birth rate, an under-resourced healthcare system, and emigration. The coronavirus pandemic, which has killed at least 400,000 people in Russia according to the national statistic agency Rosstat, has seriously aggravated the problem. In 2020, the population shrank by 510,000 people — the sharpest decline in 15 years, Rosstat calculated. It found that the population, which numbered 146.2 million as of January 1, declined by another 595,000 people by the end of August. Russia has also seen its birth rate stagnate as the mortality rate spikes, Rosstat data shows. The country is seeing falling birth rates because the generation becoming parents now were born in the 1990s, when the birthrate fell drastically due to economic uncertainties. President Vladimir Putin, who has pointed to poverty as a key factor in limiting family size, has over the years announced a litany of financial incentives to encourage Russians to have more children to boost the population. The census comes as Russia is seeing a surge in coronavirus infections. This week the country set a pandemic high for both cases and deaths as Russia's jab drive stalls and a lack of strict restrictions allow the virus to spread unchecked. To help limit the spread, much of the census will be conducted online, while workers will be regularly tested for the virus, Rosstat said. Russia has conducted two previous census counts since the fall of the Soviet Union, in 2010 and 2002. One of the only times Russia's population has grown in the years since the Soviet collapse was in 2014, when Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine, adding more than 2.5 million people. The census will run until November 14 and preliminary population figures are expected in April.",1,323,97.45,41.89,66.28,5.16,23.07,26.93,81.11,54.18,43.65,2.79,0.31,0,0,0,0,0,2.48,16.41,11.76,5.57,15.17,6.5,2.17,6.19,0,10.53,3.41,8.67,4.95,1.55,0.31,3.1,6.19,0.62,5.26,0.93,1.55,0.31,0.31,0.31,1.24,0,3.1,0.62,2.48,0.31,0,0.31,0,0.31,0,0,3.72,1.55,0.62,0,0.31,0,0.31,1.55,0.31,0,0,0,3.72,2.17,1.24,0.31,1.86,0,0,0.93,0.93,0,3.72,2.79,2.79,0,0,0,0,0,0.93,0.31,0,0,0.62,0,0,0.31,0.31,0,4.02,9.6,0,2.48,7.74,0.93,0,0,8.36,3.72,4.64,1.24,0,0,0,0,0,13.62,4.95,6.81,0,0,1.24,0.62

Chupik, an Uzbek activist who had held asylum in Russia since 2009, was detained at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport last month, with FSB officers telling her that her refugee status was revoked for alleged “document falsification” and that she is banned from entering Russia for 30 years. She has called the move “absolute nonsense” and expressed fears she could be jailed, tortured or killed if she were repatriated to Uzbekistan. “I am currently in Armenia in a beautiful spot just on the outskirts of Yerevan,” Chupik told The Moscow Times via WhatsApp. Last week, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Chupik’s deportation to Uzbekistan should be suspended, applying Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, which is applied as an urgent measure in cases where there is an imminent risk of causing irreparable harm. Russian law enforcement had also searched the apartment of Chupik’s 84-year-old mother two days after her detention. Chupik and her mother have now applied for asylum in Ukraine and are currently awaiting a response from the Ukrainian authorities, her aides have said. Chupik, 48, fled ex-Soviet Uzbekistan in 2005 following a bloody crackdown on protesters in the city of Andijan, claiming she was tortured by Uzbek special services. In Moscow, Chupik founded the Tong Jahoni (Morning of the World) NGO which provides free legal services to migrants who have faced pressure from law enforcement agencies. Each year, hundreds of thousands of migrant workers travel to Russia from former Soviet republics, mainly those in Central Asia, in search of better wages. Many face discrimination and abuse from Russian citizens and authorities. But since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, Russia has seen a mass outflow of migrant workers, triggering efforts to tackle an emerging labor shortage in industries like construction and agriculture. Earlier this year, Russia handed a 40-year entry ban to Tajikistan-born opposition activist Saidanvar Sulaimonov in what he called retaliation for his work on a Kremlin critic’s campaign for last month’s parliamentary election.",1,353,93.47,65.13,12.93,5.91,27.15,30.88,77.9,52.41,41.93,6.8,4.53,0.28,0,0,3.68,0,2.27,11.33,6.8,3.12,15.86,5.95,2.27,4.25,0,10.76,3.68,2.83,8.78,0.57,1.13,7.08,4.25,0,4.25,0,1.7,0.57,0.85,0,1.7,0,3.4,0.85,2.55,0.85,0,0.85,0.28,0,0,0.28,11.9,5.1,0,0,1.7,0.57,2.27,6.52,0.57,0,3.68,0.57,5.38,2.55,2.55,0.28,3.68,0,0.28,3.4,0.28,0,1.13,0.57,0.57,0,0,0,0,0,0.28,0.28,0,0,0.28,0,0,0,1.13,0,3.97,8.5,0.57,1.98,5.67,0.28,0,0,6.52,5.38,3.4,0.28,0.28,0.28,0,0,0,14.73,3.68,5.67,0,0,1.42,3.97

Over Standoff,English,Russia,"Russia on Tuesday warned that ties with the United States faced the threat of ""new aggravations"" as talks on embassy staffing numbers ended with no breakthrough. U.S. officials led by State Department number three Victoria Nuland met in Moscow with Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov. Consular services at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow have been severely hindered after Russia banned the mission from employing local staff as part of tit-for-tat sanctions. Ryabkov said the talks had been ""useful"" but stressed that the officials had failed to make progress on the functioning of missions, including visas and rotation of personnel. ""There is very little progress when it comes to the substantive part of the problems that exist,"" news agency Interfax quoted Ryabkov as saying. ""There is a risk of new aggravations."" ""Americans are not heeding our logic or our demands,"" state news agency RIA Novosti quoted Ryabkov as saying. In a statement later on Tuesday, the Russian Foreign Ministry said Moscow did not want to escalate tensions but warned Washington against further pursuing ""confrontational"" policies. ""We propose the removal of all restrictions that have been introduced on both sides over the past few years,"" the statement added. In Washington, the State Department confirmed there was no breakthrough but said the two sides agreed to keep up lower-level talks. ""We expect parity on staffing numbers, and we expect visa reciprocity,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters. ""There must be fairness, there must be flexibility on the Russian side if we are to achieve an equitable agreement."" U.S. senators have urged President Joe Biden to threaten to expel Russian diplomats without progress. The United States complains that Russia had included local staff, now dismissed, among the numbers of U.S. diplomats allowed in the country. The two sides are embroiled in many disagreements, including over the conflict in Ukraine — which Ryabkov said was not discussed. Joe Biden has increased pressure on the Kremlin since becoming U.S. president in January. In May, Russia formally designated the United States an ""unfriendly state.""

Ties,English,Russia,"Russia on Tuesday warned that ties with the United States faced the threat of ""new aggravations"" as talks on embassy staffing numbers ended with no breakthrough. U.S. officials led by State Department number three Victoria Nuland met in Moscow with Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov. Consular services at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow have been severely hindered after Russia banned the mission from employing local staff as part of tit-for-tat sanctions. Ryabkov said the talks had been ""useful"" but stressed that the officials had failed to make progress on the functioning of missions, including visas and rotation of personnel. ""There is very little progress when it comes to the substantive part of the problems that exist,"" news agency Interfax quoted Ryabkov as saying. ""There is a risk of new aggravations."" ""Americans are not heeding our logic or our demands,"" state news agency RIA Novosti quoted Ryabkov as saying. In a statement later on Tuesday, the Russian Foreign Ministry said Moscow did not want to escalate tensions but warned Washington against further pursuing ""confrontational"" policies. ""We propose the removal of all restrictions that have been introduced on both sides over the past few years,"" the statement added. In Washington, the State Department confirmed there was no breakthrough but said the two sides agreed to keep up lower-level talks. ""We expect parity on staffing numbers, and we expect visa reciprocity,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters. ""There must be fairness, there must be flexibility on the Russian side if we are to achieve an equitable agreement."" U.S. senators have urged President Joe Biden to threaten to expel Russian diplomats without progress. The United States complains that Russia had included local staff, now dismissed, among the numbers of U.S. diplomats allowed in the country. The two sides are embroiled in many disagreements, including over the conflict in Ukraine — which Ryabkov said was not discussed. Joe Biden has increased pressure on the Kremlin since becoming U.S. president in January. In May, Russia formally designated the United States an ""unfriendly state.""

Not weaponizing football hooligans or COVID vaccines this time, but apparently gas. From U.S National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan to British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, politicians are queuing up to blame Russia for the current global gas crisis. The trouble is that not only is this bad analysis, it is also bad politics. The economics As has been documented, the current gas crisis has numerous causes, which have combined in a singularly problematic way. A year of coronavirus (COVID-19) which saw reserves scaled down in a “gas glut”; a hard winter and a hot summer, both of which meant greater consumption; accidents interrupting supply lines. All this is exacerbated by a heightened demand from Asia, which is essentially monopolizing the liquid natural gas (LNG) which otherwise represents the fungible supply often relied on to make up for shortfalls in piped gas. And, of course, European buyers who had not wanted to commit themselves to long-term contracts as a result ended up paying spot prices. But where does Russia fit? Moscow has been fulfilling its contract commitments and, far from somehow “choking off” the gas as British sources have been claiming, is supplying close to record levels. Of course, Gazprom will be looking to maximise its profits, just as the Kremlin is inevitably trying to use the situation to push German regulators into giving the final OK to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. The morality What, though, is the sin here? First of all, Russia has no moral duty to provide more gas whenever the West wants it. So long as they observe their contractual obligations, the rest is simple market economics. To be sure, it would be very convenient for everyone else if Moscow were willing and able to increase the supply, but considering the continued grip of Western sanctions on Russia, as well as the barrage of sanctimonious critiques (which, to be fair, it is not that the current regime doesn’t deserve, but which are not levelled against other regimes which may deserve it even more), should we expect Putin to go out of his way to do us a favour? Are the U.S. and Qatari LNG suppliers who eagerly pivoted to service the seemingly insatiable Asian market also being castigated as malign market manipulators and profiteers? The question is naturally rhetorical: of course not. Besides, how far could Putin help, so long as Nord Stream 2 remains locked in regulatory limbo? It is clear that there is more capacity in the pipelines which cross Ukraine. However, Moscow is understandably reluctant to pay Kiev more transit fees. More to the point, those pipelines largely connect to legacy gas fields in the Nadym-Pur-Taz (NPT) region in West Siberia, whose capacity is in decline and which must prioritise local needs. Nord Stream 1 and 2 are fed by the new Yamal fields, but with the latter pipeline still closed, then the Russians are constrained in how much extra supply they could provide. Although there are interconnectors between the systems, even if Moscow wanted to send Yamal gas through the Central Route across Ukraine, it is unclear if they could, given that these capillaries are being used for domestic supply. In other words, it’s complex. The politics But no problem is ever so complex that politicians cannot distil it into banal simplifications and crude rhetoric. Especially when public opinion is becoming increasingly demanding, a scapegoat is always a good distraction, and these days there is no scapegoat better than a Russian one. (A scapebear?) There seem to be three main reasons for the unusually crude “analysis” being deployed over the gas crisis, each of which has a particularly problematic impact on policy, which is why this is more than just a jeremiad against crass Western political headline-chasing. Nonetheless, that lazy and self-interested search for an external excuse is certainly one of those factors. The particular problem with lazy explanations is that they often lead to lazy — and that means expensive and/or fruitless — policy responses. Talk of creating a European strategic gas reserve, for example, would be expensive and politically complex, and take years, all of which mean it would have no impact on the current situation. However, it can get much more political traction by being securitised, presented as a way of “defending” Europe against Putin's “energy weapon.” The second is that the Nord Stream 2 issue has become about much more than the pipeline but a tribal divide over the place of Russia in the world. Whether or not some of the pipelines' foes were also motivated by interests in LNG, whether selling it or receiving it, this has assumed a significance out of all proportion to the actual pipeline. Those who claim that it would somehow make Europe more dependent on Russia's “energy weapon” fail to explain quite how. Yes, it would allow Gazprom to send as little as it could through the Ukrainian pipes and thus minimize payments to Kiev, which is undoubtedly (and no doubt intentionally) bad for the Ukrainians, but it would hardly affect how much Russian gas Europe consumes. If anything, it might actually increase the EU's energy security. Although the days of Moscow turning off the gas are likely gone – the Russians cannot afford to go without the income — when Europe has suffered in the past, it was essentially as collateral, caught by the Kremlin's dispute with Kiev. Yet while Putin might be willing to play hardball with Ukraine, he would likely think twice before trying to do the same with Germany. It is worth noting that Angela Markel has been very bullish that further sanctions would result from any Russian efforts to “weaponize” the pipeline. Thus an essentially emotional campaign against Nord Stream 2 limits Europe's energy options and keeps prices high, in a last-ditch bid to punish Gazprom and the Kremlin (and, implicitly, Germany). Quite who is weaponising gas here? Thirdly, the easy assumption that whenever Russia is involved “hybrid war” and “malign influence” come in its wake, while understandable, always risks spiralling into a vicious circle. Touchy, acutely aware of its relative weaknesses and forever seeing subtle plots in Western blunders, the Kremlin tends to respond badly to overheated political rhetoric. One of the great virtues of Joe Biden's handling of Putin at the Geneva summit was to keep the tough talking to the private session, while treating Russia with respect in public. This may sound trivial, but policies are decided by people, and the ageing lords of the Kremlin take language seriously. Meanwhile, the risk is that at home, such rhetoric locks Western governments into futile and counter-productive gestures. Already I am aware of at least a couple of European foreign ministries brainstorming how to “punish Moscow for creating the gas crisis” just in case their political masters demand it. I asked one of those involved if the team actually believed Russia was to blame. Of course not, came the reply, but you know how politicians are… The wicked problem None of this is to exonerate Moscow for all the destructive and antagonistic things it does do, from poisonings in Britain to trolling in the infosphere. Indeed, to a considerable extent, it is simply reaping the fruits of years of such activities, such that too many, too easily believe too much that goes wrong is somehow down to Russia's unseen and unfriendly hand. However, there are many — analysts, experts, policymakers — who do know better or should know better. In many ways, the gas crisis is a fitting metaphor for the challenges of the modern world: complex, global, hard to fix and likely to have long and unpredictable impacts. The policies of particular countries may exacerbate it a little here, alleviate a little there. Certainly were Germany to approve Nord Stream 2 and other countries then buy gas from Russia — especially on the longer-term contracts it craves — that would help. It wouldn’t magically make the underlying issues disappear, though. The answer to problems of wicked complexity is not to pretend they are simple, not to look for a “usual suspect” to blame. It is to look for solutions of appropriate complexity. At present, for the West, this looks like a fail.

""The decision to withdraw the accreditation of eight members of the Russian delegation to NATO was done based on intelligence because these are undeclared Russian intelligence officers,"" Stoltenberg said. ""We have seen an increase in Russian malign activities, at least in Europe and therefore we need to act."" The NATO chief said that the decision to kick out the Russian representatives was not ""linked to any particular event"" — but gave no more details over the move. NATO announced Wednesday it had decided to strip the ""undeclared Russian intelligence officers"" of official accreditation to the alliance and halve the size of the Russian delegation to 10. Stoltenberg reiterated that the ""relationship between NATO and Russia is at its lowest point since the end of the Cold War. And that's because of the Russian behavior."" Ties between the West and Moscow have slumped in recent years since the Kremlin's 2014 annexation of Crimea and over its involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Russia has long had an observer mission to NATO as part of a two-decade-old NATO-Russia Council meant to promote cooperation in common security areas, but it is not a member of the U.S.-led Alliance. The Kremlin said earlier Thursday that the expulsions showed NATO members have no desire to normalise relations with Moscow. ""There is an obvious contradiction in the statements of NATO representatives about the desire to normalise relations with our country and in real actions,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. The Russian mission has been downsized once before, when seven of its members were ejected after the 2018 poisoning by the Novichok nerve agent on a Russian former double agent, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter in Britain. Accreditation applications by another three Russian diplomats were denied. Meetings of a NATO-Russia council have not been held since 2019 against the backdrop of the heightened tensions. ""We are ready to engage in meaningful dialogue with with Russia, and we are ready also to convene a NATO-Russia Council meeting,"" Stoltenberg said. ""We have actually invited Russia for a long time. So far, Russia has not responded positively."" Sky News reported that NATO's decision came after information was revealed in April about fatal explosions at a Czech ammunition depot in 2014 that Prague says involved two Russian spies — identified as allegedly implicated in the Skripal poisoning. That Czech Republic-Russia incident led to the mutual expulsion of dozens of EU and Russian diplomats and other embassy staff.",1,433,95.95,57.95,34.57,12.9,22.79,32.79,82.22,57.51,46.19,4.85,1.62,0,1.39,0,0.23,0,3.23,15.47,9.47,2.54,17.55,6,2.08,6.24,1.39,11.32,5.54,3.7,7.62,4.16,0.23,3.23,10.62,0.46,10.16,2.31,2.31,0.69,0.69,0.92,3,0,3.93,1.39,2.08,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.55,5.08,1.15,0,0.23,0,3,6,0.23,0,0.23,0.46,8.08,4.62,3.46,0,4.39,0,0,4.39,0,0,0.92,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.23,0.69,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,0.23,0,3.7,8.78,0,1.15,6,0.92,0.23,0.46,4.39,7.39,2.54,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,13.86,4.85,2.31,0,0,0.92,5.77

This is Novaya Gazeta's,” Muratov said after the Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded him and prominent journalist from the Philippines, Maria Ressa, the 2021 Peace Prize. Established in 1993, Novaya Gazeta gained a reputation for hard-hitting journalism on topics including the 2014 downing of flight MH17 and the 2016 Panama Papers leaks into offshore dealings. The paper continued its intrepid work despite the killings of six of its journalists, most notably Anna Politkovskaya in 2006, and threats and harassment of its reporters over the years. Here’s a look at some of Novaya Gazeta’s major investigative reports in recent years, both under Muratov's leadership and otherwise: Chechen anti-LGBT campaign, 2017 and 2019 Novaya Gazeta broke the news in 2017 on the alleged torture and killings of people in southern Russia’s republic of Chechnya who are suspected of being gay. Its reporting has raised international awareness of Chechnya’s alleged anti-gay purges, leading to international legal action brought outside Russian borders. Western-sanctioned Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has denied Novaya Gazeta’s reports of a broad crackdown on LGBT members, claiming that only heterosexuals live in his deeply conservative majority-Muslim region. Extrajudicial killings, 2021 Chechen security officers had also rounded up civilians and summarily executed them in sweeping anti-terror raids around the same time as the gay purges of 2017, Novaya Gazeta reported this year, citing an ex-policeman’s testimony. That report prompted officials in Chechnya, which Kadyrov has ruled with a degree of autonomy in exchange for loyalty to Moscow following two devastating separatist wars in the 1990s, to call for Novaya Gazeta’s closure. Syria mercenary beheading, 2019 Novaya Gazeta linked Russian mercenaries to the gruesome beheading, dismembering and immolation of a Syrian detainee in 2017. The publication withheld the identities of the fighters, believed to be mercenaries for Kremlin-linked private military contractor the Wagner Group, but said it stood ready to provide its materials to Russian law enforcement if they wanted to investigate the torture. The Kremlin has said the footage of the cold-blooded beheading had nothing to do with Russia’s military operations in Syria. Private military companies are illegal in Russia — a technicality that the Kremlin has used to deny Wagner’s reported presence in Syria, Ukraine, Libya, Sudan and other conflict-torn countries. Contract killings, 2018 Novaya Gazeta linked contract killings and attacks on Russian opposition activists and bloggers to U.S.-sanctioned catering magnate Yevgeny Prigozhin, who western journalists have linked to Wagner. The article, which cited interviews with a former Prigozhin associate who has since disappeared, was published days after unknown individuals sent its author, Novaya Gazeta reporter Denis Korotkov, a funeral wreath and a severed goat’s head. Prison torture, 2018 and 2019 Novaya Gazeta finally succeeded in triggering an investigation and a nationwide inspection after it published body cam footage from 2016-17 of prison guards torturing an inmate in the city of Yaroslavl northeast of Moscow. After the shocking footage put a national spotlight on the issue of prisoner abuse in Russia, the publication followed up with new videos of abuse two years later.",1,536,97.64,41.18,26.98,1.19,29.78,35.82,74.07,47.76,38.25,4.66,1.68,0.19,0,0,0.56,0.37,2.99,12.13,8.21,4.1,16.04,3.54,1.12,4.85,0.37,7.65,4.85,2.61,8.96,0.56,1.68,6.72,5.41,0.19,5.22,1.49,0.75,0.37,0.75,0,2.24,0,6.53,1.49,4.85,0.93,0,0.75,0,0,0,0,8.77,5.6,0.19,0,3.17,0,1.31,2.99,0,0,0,0.56,2.8,1.31,1.31,0.19,6.16,0,0.19,5.6,0.37,0,2.99,0,0,0,0,0,0.75,0,1.68,0,0.19,0.37,0,0,0,1.31,0.56,0,1.68,9.14,0.56,1.12,7.46,0.19,0,0,3.17,3.73,2.43,0.37,0,0,0,0,0,15.3,3.73,5.97,0,0,2.43,3.17

Long derided as a gastronomic wasteland, Russia's restaurant scene has emerged in recent years from a post-Soviet reputation for blandness, with establishments in Moscow regularly making lists of some of the world's best. Representatives of the Michelin guide — considered the international standard of restaurant rankings — released the first Moscow edition of their iconic red book at a ceremony at Moscow. Sixty-nine restaurants were recommended in all. Two restaurants — Twins Garden run by twin brothers Ivan and Sergei Berezutskiy, and chef Artem Estafev's Artest — were given two stars. Seven restaurants were given one star, including White Rabbit, whose chef Vladimir Mukhin featured in an episode of the Netflix documentary series ""Chef's Table."" None were given three stars — the Holy Grail of the restaurant world. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said at the ceremony that the release of the guide was an important event at a tough time for the restaurant industry. ""It's big moral support in this time of pandemic, when restaurants are having a particularly difficult time,"" he said. Sobyanin said it also showed Russia had rediscovered a food tradition that had suffered under the Soviet Union. ""Unfortunately during the Soviet period these traditions were lost,"" he said. ""I am proud that Moscow's restaurants have become a calling card for our fantastic city."" Michelin's international director Gwendal Poullennec told a press conference that the guide had used an international team of inspectors for its list and there was ""no compromise in our methodology."" Speaking to AFP earlier, he said Russia's food scene had been ""reinventing"" itself since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union. ""There is an evolution of the Russian culinary scene. It is more and more dynamic,"" Poullennec said. He said he was surprised by ""the quality and abundance of produce"" in Moscow restaurants, highlighting in particular the seafood, such as crab and caviar, that are ""exclusive"" elsewhere but in Russia are available at a ""reasonable price."" Russia became the 35th country to have a Michelin guide and Moscow is the first city of the former Soviet Union to be awarded stars. The selection of restaurants will appear in print and also be available via an app in 25 languages, including Russian. Michelin in December said that chefs in Moscow had set themselves apart by highlighting Russian ingredients, including king crab from the Far Eastern city of Vladivostok and smetana, the sour cream used in preparing beef stroganoff. Moscow restaurants have increasingly turned to local ingredients after Western sanctions following Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 resulted in a scarcity of many European foods. A number of restaurants that relied on meat, cheese and fish imported from the West were forced to close, while those that strived to source their ingredients from Russian regions became more competitive. In explaining why it chose Moscow, the guide last year pointed to the ""unique flavors"" of the ""nation's emblematic first courses such as borscht."" Another leading French restaurant guide, Gault et Millau, launched its first Russian edition in 2017. In 2019, Gault & Millau was sold to Russian investors. Twins Garden and White Rabbit have previously featured on the World's 50 Best Restaurants list.

According to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, Russian nationals are “disproportionately represented,” accounting for 14% of the more than 27,000 named companies. The news is at once dramatic, predictable, and ⁠— alas ⁠— arguably pointless. This no doubt sounds deeply churlish, an offense to the 600-plus journalists from 150 different news outlets including Russia's iStories, who dug into the data for two years, connecting the dots and uncovering the faces behind the anonymous offshore shell companies. The Papers will, one can hope, provide further impetus for efforts in the West to bring meaningful transparency to what is, for all the ritual declarations of politicians, bankers and regulators, still a financial system that offers numerous opportunities for legal avoidance of tax and scrutiny to those able to afford the right lawyers and accountants. The way former British prime minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie sidestepped paying $423,000 property tax by buying a $8,75m building in a posh London neighborhood through an offshore company based in the British Virgin Islands has certainly provided a new focus for criticism both of the couple, but also this particular legal loophole. The Russian Response When it comes to Russia, while a cast of the high and the mighty appear, inevitably media attention has focused on anything that can be linked with Putin, notably allegations about the family of a reputed former girlfriend. That reflects Western media obsessions as much as anything else. But does it really matter?  First of all, the news can be mobilized for political purposes in other ways, too. The relatively innocuous discovery that before his election, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy moved millions of dollars assets into a network of offshores, in collaboration with his aid Serhiy Shefir and present security service chief Ivan Bakanov, has been pounced on with glee not just by his political enemies but also the Russian media. Given his carefully cultivated image as the one honest man in Ukrainian politics, the impression of impropriety ⁠— even if everything he did was legal ⁠— is a problem. Secondly, the very scale of the revelations dilutes their impact by contributing to the sense ⁠— not entirely inaccurate ⁠— that everyone with power and money is much the same. That said, Beijing’s magnates and politicians are surprisingly absent, not least given the ample evidence there is of systemic corruption in China. Likewise, there is a dearth of Americans, and the notion that they never abuse financial loopholes does rather stretch credulity. No wonder that Russian sources also rush to portray this as a strategic leak by the US intelligence community intended to undermine the Kremlin. It has to be said, though, that this would seem to be a rather scattershot and slow-motion attack. Would Washington really also embarrass so many allies in the quest to air some dirty Russian laundry? In any case, while individuals may be turning to their lawyers and PR consultants, how much real impact will this have? The sorry truth would seem to be that by now no one is either surprised nor mobilized by these kind of revelations. Do any Russians really presume that these people weren't fiddling the books? Will it comes as a shock that, for example, Sergei Chemezov, CEO of Russian state defence conglomerate Rostec, has a superyacht registered through an offshore? They are probably more surprised that he does not moor it at a secret Pacific island hideaway populated by genetically-engineered unicorns. The Navalny dilemma This is not just about the Pandora Papers, although they do seem to demonstrate that more is not always better, it also speaks to a fundamental political challenge facing Team Navalny.  Their 'He's not Dimon to you' video had the virtue of dismantling Dmitry Medvedev's reputation as being one of the few honest figures in the regime. 'Putin's Palace' was not just their first direct attack on the monarch, it had a voyeuristic “cribs of the rich and famous” dimension. I suspect many watched not for the forensic analysis of the financing but the pole-dance hookah bar. Where do you, can you, go from there? It is all very well going after Sergei Lavrov, and other boyars, but there is surely a law of diminishing returns. Once there is a general assumption that everyone is a crook and a thief, then further revelations may enthuse your base, but are hardly likely to expand it. As pollsters put it, that is already 'priced in' to people's political decision-making. A lot of journalists can justly congratulate themselves on some serious work. Hopefully, campaigners will be able to use the latest revelations to push for serious regulatory changes. But for Russia, the likelihood that this is a one-week wonder, at best. Unlike Pandora's box, there's unlikely to be Hope at the bottom.",1,849,76.96,32.76,17.98,26.39,23.58,28.5,83.51,64.19,53.24,8.24,2.59,0.12,0,0.47,0.94,0.94,5.65,18.26,9.07,2.36,13.9,7.54,5.89,6.36,1.77,11.07,8.36,5.3,5.89,0.82,1.18,4,15.67,1.53,13.9,2.71,1.18,1.3,3.18,1.41,4.48,0,4.36,2.24,1.77,1.3,0.71,0.12,0,0,0,0,8.72,4.48,0.82,0.24,0.59,0.94,0.82,4.59,0.12,0.12,0.24,1.06,3.65,2.36,1.18,0.12,4.71,0,0.24,2.71,1.88,0.24,0.35,0,0,0,0,0.12,0.12,0,0,0,0.35,0.12,0.24,0.12,0,0.24,0.35,0.59,2.12,7.18,0.82,1.3,4.59,0.82,0.12,0.12,2.12,2.36,4.48,1.65,0,0,0,0,0,14.37,3.53,6.6,0.71,0,1.88,1.65

Footage published on the Ukrainian armed forces’ Facebook page showed the Bayraktar TB2k targeting and shooting a Soviet-era howitzer it identified as the pro-Russian forces’ D-30. The Ukrainian armed forces accused the separatists of wounding one soldier and killing another with the D-30 near the eastern town of Hranitne on the front line. “Bayraktar was used in order to force the enemy to cease fire,” the Ukrainian armed forces’ general staff said in a statement. “After that, the shelling of Ukrainian positions stopped.” The drone strike did not inflict any military or civilian casualties, Russia’s Interfax news agency quoted an unnamed source in the self-proclaimed, separatist-held Donetsk People’s Republic as saying Wednesday. The neighboring separatist-held Luhansk People’s Republic accused Kiev of using the Bayraktar in violation of ceasefire agreements that ban the deployment of foreign drones on the front line. Tuesday’s drone strike is the first since Turkey delivered the first batch of Bayraktar TB2 to Ukraine in July. The Turkish private company Baykar, which produces the armed drones, describes the TB2 model as a ""medium altitude long endurance tactical unmanned aerial vehicle capable of conducting intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and armed attack missions"" with a range of up to 27 hours. Media reports said Kiev plans to buy around 50 Bayraktar TB2 drones, a flagship model that has been used in conflicts against Russian proxies in Syria, Libya and the Nagorno-Karabakh region at the center of a decades-long dispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Ukraine and Turkey signed a memorandum in late September to establish a joint training and maintenance center for the drones in Ukraine. This month, Ukraine’s foreign minister said it plans to build a factory to produce Bayraktar drones in the country. The sale of drones to Kiev places Ankara in a delicate position, as Turkey also cooperates in the defense sector with Russia, Ukraine's rival. The Kremlin said Wednesday that Turkey’s supply of drones to Ukraine risks destabilizing the eastern Ukraine conflict despite Moscow’s “special” relations with Ankara. The Ukrainian army has been locked in a long-running conflict with separatist fighters in Donetsk and Luhansk since 2014 after Moscow annexed the peninsula of Crimea from Kiev. The conflict has claimed more than 13,000 lives. Ukraine and its Western allies accuse Russia of sending troops and arms to support the separatists, which Moscow denies.

Both Moscow and Kiev claimed ownership of the Scythian treasures dating back to the 2nd century B.C., which were loaned to Amsterdam’s Allard Pierson Museum. The museum’s “Crimea: Gold and Secrets of the Black Sea” exhibit opened in February 2014, one month before Russia seized the Black Sea peninsula from Ukraine. The Amsterdam Court of Appeal sided with Kiev and ruled that the collection of more than 2,000 items should be returned to Ukraine, the Dutch broadcaster NOS reported. “Although the objects originate in Crimea,” the judge said, according to a video posted by Russia’s state-run RIA Novosti news agency, “they are part of Ukraine’s heritage after it became independent in 1991.” According to RIA Novosti, the judge said her ruling is subject to appeal with the Netherlands’ supreme court. A lawyer for the Russian-held Crimean museums told RIA Novosti they have three months to appeal the ruling, in which case deliberations could last another year. Russian lawmakers and Crimean museum directors were quick to condemn the Dutch court ruling, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy vowed to “return Crimea” like it did the Scythian gold. Four Crimean museums launched a joint legal bid seven years ago to force the Allard Pierson Museum to return the historic collection of archaeological artefacts dubbed the ""Scythian Gold"" to the peninsula. The impressive collection spans the 2nd century BC to the late medieval era, when Crimea was at the crossroads of ancient trade routes through an area dominated by the Scythian people. A lower court said in 2016 that the treasures were part of Ukraine's cultural heritage and must be returned instead to Kiev, adding that Crimea was not considered a sovereign state. The Crimean museums appealed against the judgement, saying the artifacts belonged there, and the Dutch court of appeal said in 2019 that it needed more time to decide on the matter. The treasures themselves have remained in ""safe storage"" in the Allard Pierson museum, which is the archaeological museum of the University of Amsterdam, pending the appeal.

The country of 2.6 million people wedged between Romania and Ukraine gets gas from Russia via its pro-Russian separatist region of Transnistria and Ukraine. Gazprom has hiked prices from $550 per thousand cubic meters last month to $790 this month – a level Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Spinu said was ""not justified and not realistic"" for Europe's poorest country. ""We face a critical situation,"" Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita said Friday. She told parliament Moldova would be seeking supplies from EU countries and thanked Romania and Ukraine for already supplying some gas. While Gazprom and its daughter company Moldovagaz last month agreed to extend their existing contract for supplies until Oct. 31, Gavrilita said Moldovagaz ""is not keeping its word."" The company is not providing the required volumes of natural gas, she said, with Moldova receiving a third less than usual for October. The prime minister said Moldova and Gazprom were continuing negotiations but that the ex-Soviet country has ""no confidence"" in the success of the talks and ""must take action"" or be ""left without gas."" The month-long state of emergency gives Moldovan utility company Energocom the power to secure gas from other countries. The country's gas shortages come amid skyrocketing gas prices that some in Europe have blamed on Moscow not providing additional supplies to put pressure on the continent. Some experts say Russia has boosted prices as pressure on Moldova for electing a pro-European president in Maia Sandu last year, who has said she wants to fold the breakaway region of Transnistria back into Moldova.

Despite the contract being extended, Moldovan Prime Minster Natalia Gavrilita said on Friday the country was receiving a third less natural gas than usual for October. ""We face a critical situation,"" she said. She told parliament Moldova would be seeking supplies from EU countries and thanked Romania and Ukraine for already providing some gas. The month-long state of emergency, which will last until Nov. 20, gives Moldovan utility company Energocom the powers to secure gas from other countries. The country's gas shortages come amid skyrocketing gas prices that some in Europe have blamed on Moscow not providing additional supplies to put pressure on the continent.",1,292,94.13,14.07,47.74,24.61,22.46,31.85,73.63,52.74,39.38,3.42,1.37,0,0.34,0,1.03,0,2.05,11.99,6.85,4.45,14.04,4.79,0.68,5.82,2.05,10.27,5.82,6.85,3.08,0.34,0.68,2.05,7.19,0,6.85,0.34,0.34,0.68,0.68,0.34,5.14,0,1.71,1.03,0.68,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.22,4.45,0.34,0.34,0,0.34,3.77,1.37,0,0,0.68,0.34,1.03,1.03,0,0,7.88,0.34,0,4.79,2.74,0,0.34,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.03,0,0.68,0,0.34,0,0,0.68,0,4.11,8.9,0.34,1.71,7.19,0,0,0,5.14,5.82,1.71,0.68,0,0,0,0,0,16.44,4.79,2.74,0,0,2.74,6.16

An Amsterdam court ruled this week that the pieces, dubbed ""Scythian Gold"" and loaned to the city's Allard Pierson Museum just before Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014, should be handed over to Ukraine. The ruling was hailed in Kiev as a victory. In a statement, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused the Dutch judges of being ""guided exclusively by political motives."" She said the artefacts were part of the ""cultural and historical heritage of the peoples of the Crimean peninsula."" Zakharova said Moscow had hoped that ""at least the culture sphere would stay out of politics."" Earlier Russia's Investigative Committee said it had instructed investigators in the Russian-controlled peninsula to probe ""the non-return of cultural items belonging to the Republic of Crimea."" The head of the committee, Alexander Bastrykin, had also asked for investigators to work with Moscow's Foreign Ministry to ""thoroughly study"" the case. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy this week said the ""long-awaited victory"" to return the treasure, was a ""fair decision."" ""We always regain what's ours. After the 'Scythian gold', we'll return Crimea,"" he said on Twitter after the ruling. The Kremlin warned Wednesday that the comments ""could have negative consequences."" The rich collection spans the second century BC to the late medieval era, when Crimea was at the crossroads of ancient trade routes through an area dominated by the Scythian people. The fate of the gold has been subject to legal wrangling since four museums on the peninsula launched a joint challenge seven years ago to have them returned. In 2016, a lower Dutch court ruled that the treasures were part of Ukraine's cultural heritage and must be returned to Kiev — not to the museums that launched the petition — on the grounds that Crimea was not considered a sovereign state. The Crimean museums appealed the judgement. But on Tuesday, the Dutch court of appeal ruled that the gold should be held by Ukraine ""pending stabilization in the Crimea.""",1,354,98.21,50.15,20.4,31.93,20.82,29.66,76.27,56.78,46.33,4.8,1.69,0,0.85,0,0.56,0.28,3.11,18.08,14.41,1.41,15.25,7.06,1.98,3.95,0.56,10.45,4.8,3.11,7.06,1.13,1.69,4.24,6.5,0.28,6.21,1.41,1.41,1.98,0.28,0.56,1.69,0,3.11,1.98,1.13,0.28,0.28,0,0,0,0,0,8.19,4.24,0.28,0,0.28,1.13,2.82,3.11,0,0,0.56,0.28,3.11,1.69,1.41,0,5.08,1.13,0,2.82,1.41,0,0.28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.28,0.85,0,0,0,0.56,0.85,0,1.69,6.21,0.28,1.69,5.37,0,0,0,5.93,8.76,0.56,0.85,0.28,0.28,0,0,0,18.36,4.8,3.39,0,0,2.54,7.63

Defense Chief Heads to Black Sea Region",English,Russia,"U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin headed to the Black Sea region Sunday aiming to shore up alliances with countries pressured by Russia and show gratitude for their contributions to the two-decade war in Afghanistan. Austin will visit Georgia, Romania and Ukraine before taking part in the in-person defense ministers summit at NATO in Brussels on October 21-22. ""We are reassuring and reinforcing the sovereignty of countries that are on the front lines of Russian aggression,"" a senior U.S. defense official told reporters ahead of the trip. All three countries are in the NATO orbit — Romania a full member and Georgia and Ukraine partner states. All three also sit on the rim of the Black Sea, where Russia has sought to expand its own influence and prevent expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the US-European alliance. Russia has occupied Ukraine's Crimea and has troops stationed in Georgia's breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. And Kiev is battling pro-Russian separatists in the country's east, in a conflict that has cost 13,000 lives. In June Russian forces menaced Dutch and British warships as they sailed near Crimea. Austin will also extend thanks to its partners for their contributions, and significant losses, as part of coalition forces in Afghanistan over two decades, before the hasty U.S. exit this year that ceded the country to the Taliban. ""We are going to be showing recognition and appreciation for the sacrifices and the commitments of our partners and allies,"" the official said. In Georgia, Austin will meet with Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili and Minister of Defense Juansher Burchuladze, with a key aim to keep up defense cooperation as a three-year U.S. Army training program expires this year. Georgia hopes Austin's visit will help advance its case for becoming a full NATO member. It will be ""another clear message from the U.S. in support of Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, its stable and democratic development, and for the country's Euro-Atlantic goals"" Foreign Minister David Zalkaliani said Wednesday. ""We expect that meetings will be focused on further deepening our cooperation, regional security issues, and the process of Georgia's NATO integration,"" he said. In Ukraine, Austin will have talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky and Minister of Defense Andriy Taran, both of whom visited Washington at the beginning of September to press their case for NATO membership with President Joe Biden. And in Romania, he will see President Klaus Iohannis and Minister of National Defense Nicolae-Ionel Ciuca, amid a fresh political crisis in the country. In all three, the United States wants to expand defense support but also sees problems of democratic development and corruption. In Georgia, tens of thousands of protestors were out in the streets this week over the arrest of ex-president and opposition leader Mikheil Saakashvili and over allegations of fraud in recent elections. Ukraine is under heavy pressure from the West, which provides the country extensive aid, to halt rampant graft. ""It is our belief that strengthening democratic institutions creates greater resilience against Russian influence and external manipulation,"" the U.S. official said. ""Our bilateral assistance is actually very much focused on the specific aspects of institutional reform that are necessary for NATO. And that applies to both Georgia and to Ukraine."" Austin will end the week at NATO headquarters in Brussels, where ties with the U.S., frayed by the previous administration of Donald Trump, took a fresh hit last month when Washington unexpectedly announced a new pact with Australia and Britain focused on China in the Indo-Pacific region. The US official said Austin would reinforce U.S. commitment to the pact and press for military adaptation to address future threats.

Russia’s Foreign Ministry accused Ukrainian forces of detaining ceasefire observer Andrei Kosyak last Wednesday and failing to inform Moscow via diplomatic channels within an allotted three-day period. Ukraine says Kosyak was a Russian citizen carrying out an undercover reconnaissance mission for the separatists. “We call on Ukraine to… stop provocations on the contact line in Donbass, report the location of Russian citizen [Andrei] Kosyak and grant Russian consular staff access to him,” spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. Russian-backed separatists in the Donbass — the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk regions in southeastern Ukraine — have been locked in a 7-year war with Ukrainian forces that has killed some 13,000 people, according to a United Nations tally. “We regard Ukraine’s actions as treacherous and provocative,” Zakharova said in a statement on the Foreign Ministry’s website. Separatist-controlled Luhansk’s de-facto leader Leonid Pasechnik had identified Kosyak as the breakaway region’s “officer” who was overseeing the ceasefire during road clearing work when he was captured. Zakharova urged Europe’s main security body, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), to give a “principled assessment” of Kosyak’s detention. Protests demanding Kosyak’s release temporarily suspended the OSCE conflict monitoring mission’s work in separatist-controlled Horlivka in recent days. The mission continued after the protesters had left the Horlivka hotel housing its observers, Reuters reported Monday.

Spinu's government has declared a state of emergency and imported gas from outside Russia – its Soviet-era master – for the first time in its history after Gazprom hiked prices for the impoverished country. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday's talks will have an ""absolutely commercial nature."" ""There is no politicization here and there cannot be,"" he said. Russian President Vladimir Putin said this month that allegations from European capitals that Moscow was using energy as a geopolitical weapon were ""politically charged babble that have no grounds."" Moldova's contract with Gazprom ran out at the end of September. A deal has been reached for October but the Moldovan government said Moscow is sending far less gas to the country than usual. Last week, Russian media reported that Gazprom is threatening to cut the country off if it does not settle its debts and sign a new contract by December.

During a bitter standoff with Moscow, Moldova declared a state of emergency and for the first time signed a gas supply deal with a non-Russian country. But on Friday both sides announced they had agreed to extend their previous agreement by five years, with deliveries to start from November 1. ""The parties reached an agreement on the price formula, the audit of the Moldova-Gaz debt and on subsequent dialogue for repayments,"" Moldovan foreign ministry spokesman Daniel Voda said in a statement. Gazprom said in a separate statement that the extension was made on ""mutually beneficial terms"". The agreement was reached after talks in Saint Petersburg, where Gazprom has its headquarters, between Moldova's Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Spinu and the Russian state-controlled firm's CEO Alexei Miller. Wedged between Romania and Ukraine, Moldova has traditionally received gas from Russia via its pro-Moscow separatist region of Transnistria and through Ukraine. But Moldova's contract with Gazprom expired in September. Gazprom extended the contract until the end of October but raised prices, which Spinu said at the time was ""not justified and not realistic"" for Europe's poorest country. As well as declaring a state of emergency, Moldova signed a contract to buy natural gas from Poland -- the first time it has turned to a supplier other than Russia. Voda on Friday said that Moldova ""received insufficient volumes of gas from Gazprom based on the one-month extension of the expired contract with a three-fold price increase"". He said the Gazprom deal had been extended ""for another five years based on the price formula proposed by the Moldovan side"", but did not give further details about prices. Europe is in the throes of an energy crisis with gas prices soaring to record highs as economies come back online after the end of pandemic lockdowns and renewables like solar and wind see a slowdown in supplies. Critics in Western capitals blame Russia for the price hikes, saying Moscow is not upping deliveries to pressure Europe to agree more long-term contracts and for the certification of the recently completed controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Some have also accused Moscow of raising prices for Moldova after the election last year of pro-European President Maia Sandu.

The Russian president enjoys the approval of 67% of Russian respondents despite weeks of record Covid-19 infections and deaths that the authorities have largely pinned on slow vaccination uptake. Putin ordered a nationwide partial lockdown from Oct. 30-Nov. 7 in a bid to slow the virus’ spread after placing most Covid-19 response decisions in the hands of regional leaders for much of the pandemic. His October approval ratings are up from 64% in September and 61% in August, Levada said. Despite the increase, Putin's approval has yet to return to the high levels seen following Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, as unpopular pension reforms and lagging living standards have fueled public discontent. Russia’s lower-house State Duma has also seen a slight boost in its approval ratings as well as the ruling, pro-Kremlin United Russia party, which increased its rating slightly to 29% from 26% in July. The results follow last month’s State Duma elections that saw United Russia claim a decisive win amid widespread reports of electoral fraud and the blocking of most opposition candidates from the ballot. According to the poll, 48% of Russians believe that the country is headed in the right direction and 43% think the country is on the wrong path.

NATO this month stripped eight Russian mission members of their accreditations, accusing them of secretly working as intelligence officers. “We are suspending the work of our official mission to NATO, including the work of our military representative from Nov. 1 or it could take a few more days,” the state-run TASS news agency quoted Lavrov as saying to reporters. Russia will also close the Western military bloc’s liaison mission — established in 2002 and hosted at the Belgian Embassy — and information bureau in Moscow, Lavrov said. ""NATO is not interested in any equitable dialogue or in any joint work. If this is so, then we do not see a great need to continue to pretend that any changes are possible in the foreseeable future,"" he said. He said that in case of urgent matters, NATO could liaise via the Russian Ambassador in Belgium. According to Lavrov, Russia notified NATO of its actions in advance. Tensions between Moscow and NATO have remained at their highest levels since the Cold War in the years following Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. Russia has long had an observer mission to NATO as part of a two-decade-old NATO-Russia Council meant to promote cooperation in common security areas, but it is not a member of the U.S.-led Alliance.

The company did not book any additional capacity on pipelines running through Ukraine to the EU for the month, and ordered just a third — 31 million cubic meters per day — of the space on the Yamal pipeline running through Belarus and Poland. The decision caused gas prices in Europe to fluctuate in trading Tuesday and Wednesday. Spot prices for natural gas in Europe are trading near record highs amid concerns over low storage, a possible cold winter, and weak performance of renewable sources over the summer. Russia has been blamed for holding back on supplies and seeking to use the situation to secure fast track approval for its controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia is ready to provide more gas to the continent. Gazprom says supplies to the EU are running near record volumes over the course of the year and that it was prioritizing refilling Russia’s own gas storage facilities ahead of the winter, resulting in a 30% increase in supply to the Russian market. But with that process due to be completed by the end of October, the refusal to book additional capacity on pipelines to Europe for November looks set to prolong Europe’s gas price crisis and trigger fresh criticism of the Russian energy giant. “This could signal that Gazprom will not increase exports to Europe,” said Mitch Jennings, senior analyst at Sova Capital. European gas storage facilities are only 77% full — compared to 95% this time last year, analysts at Sova Capital highlighted in a research note Tuesday. Gazprom’s own data shows gas supplies to Europe dropped in October. Gazprom had been booking up to 15 million cubic meters of additional capacity through Ukraine earlier this year, Reuters reported. But since the completion of Nord Stream 2, Moscow has been pushing European regulators to approve the pipeline, which it says could start sending gas under the Baltic Sea to Germany almost immediately. Russia has said Europe is to blame for the gas crisis across the continent, pointing to the liberalization of the market in favor of short-term contracts, instead of the long-term multi-year deals Gazprom wants to strike with European customers. Gazprom’s share price has soared amid rising prices for its main product, with the company trading up 60% over the last six months.",1,416,99,31.97,40.73,8.87,27.73,30.77,77.16,55.77,41.11,2.64,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.64,12.02,8.41,3.13,19.47,4.81,1.44,2.4,0.48,9.86,6.73,7.69,3.61,0.48,0.24,2.88,5.29,0,5.29,0.24,1.44,0.72,0.72,0,1.68,0,2.64,0.72,1.92,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.57,3.37,0.24,0,0.72,0.48,1.2,0.72,0,0,0,0,1.92,0.24,1.68,0,6.73,0,0,4.81,2.88,0,0.24,0.24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.48,0.24,0,0,0.72,0,0.24,0.72,0.24,2.64,10.34,0.24,1.92,7.69,0.24,0,0.24,6.01,3.37,3.61,1.2,0,0,0,0,0,10.34,3.61,3.61,0,0,0.96,2.16

Drop to the floor!” Feeling anxious, she and her officemate cautiously checked what was happening. The noise was coming from a large conference room where a film about the catastrophic famine in early 1930’s Soviet Ukraine was screening. They saw two dozen thugs blocking the screen, chanting “shame!,” “fascists!,” and “get out of here!” Memorial’s staff called the police, but by the time the officers arrived most of the intruders dispersed, and police led away the three who remained. Several Memorial representatives went to the district police precinct to give testimony. Then, without explanation, the police blocked the activists and anyone else in Memorial’s building from leaving. They held them there for hours, late into the night, forcing everyone to submit a written “explanation” before they could leave. “At first, we did not understand we were being locked in. We actually continued with the screening after the thugs left.” Orlova said. “But then at around 9 p.m. I decided to call it a day. I went to the staff exit — and saw a police officer blocking the door. I told him I had a long commute ahead of me and I needed to leave — and he refused to let me out.” Uniformed and plain clothes police blocked the front entrance, she said. Supporters of Memorial who heard about the intruders had come, despite pouring rain, to offer support, but the police forced them to stay outside. “This went on for hours.” Memorial activists kept trying to get the police officers to explain what was happening and why, but could not get a coherent response. Finally, police said that everyone would be allowed to leave only if they provided a written statement describing the event itself, the intrusion and providing full passport details, residential address, phone number, as well as information about their education, workplace, and work title. “I said I won’t be doing any such thing without a lawyer present,” Orlova said. In fact, members of their legal team stood outside, but police had blocked them from entering. More time went by. A plain clothes officer who was apparently in charge demanded to see all of Memorial’s office premises, including work stations. A Memorial activist overheard police talking among themselves, saying they planned to seize some equipment. Fearing that their offices would be arbitrarily searched and documents and electronic devices confiscated, Memorial’s team redoubled their demands to see their lawyers. Meanwhile, the officers guarding the staff entrance apparently walked away, and, to ensure the door remained blocked, locked it with a pair of handcuffs from the outside. An image of the handcuffed door was widely shared on social media, contributing to public and media outcry. Exasperated, one of Memorial’s legal team members gained entry to the building through an open window and confronted the police, who eventually allowed two lawyers into the building. At 2 a.m. the police finally left, taking Memorial’s DVR with them, despite the fact that Memorial had earlier provided them with complete footage of the evening. When thanking Memorial supporters and independent media, the head of Memorial, Yan Rachinsky, said that without their support the story could have had a “different [worse] ending.” He also noted that while the thuggish attempt to disrupt the screening cost Memorial 20-30 minutes the police interference did more damage, costing them close to “seven hours and a DVR,” not to mention the stress. For years, the Russian government has smeared Memorial as a “foreign agent,” and repeatedly fined the group under this abusive legislation. And it’s not the first time pseudo-patriotic thugs have targeted Memorial, and each time, police do little, if anything, to stop them. And although police showed up last night, one has to wonder what message they were sending when they block everyone inside the building. Memorial stands up for human rights and provides a platform for free debate and artistic expression. The image of police handcuffs locking the organization’s door is an indelible symbol of the vicious crackdown on fundamental freedoms by Russian authorities, currently sweeping across the country.  Maybe that was the message.",1,707,88.52,61.9,47.84,12.78,17.24,27.86,86.7,62.94,49.65,9.19,6.22,1.27,0.42,0,0.99,2.97,2.97,14.71,10.04,2.26,14.43,4.95,4.1,6.22,0.71,13.58,4.81,3.82,8.06,1.56,0.85,5.66,7.78,0.57,7.21,1.41,0.85,0.99,1.27,0.14,2.83,0,2.4,0.85,1.56,0.99,0,0.99,0.42,0.14,0,0,14.57,6.65,0.99,0.14,0.28,0.42,3.96,8.06,0,0,0.57,0.42,1.7,0.85,0.42,0.42,3.68,0.42,0.57,2.4,0.28,0,2.83,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.4,0.42,0,0.71,0.14,0.28,0,0.14,0,0.14,4.38,12.16,0.42,2.4,7.36,1.27,0.85,0.14,4.53,7.36,0.85,0.85,0,0,0,0,0,19.38,5.8,7.21,0,0.71,1.41,4.24

But Ukraine's defense ministry said in a statement late Monday that ""no additional deployment"" of Russian forces had been observed. The videos could comprise ""special informational and psychological actions"" and show a planned troop movement after a Russian military exercise, it added. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Tuesday he had discussed the conflict with U.S. President Joe Biden on the sidelines of the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow. ""The U.S. continues to support territorial integrity and reforms in Ukraine,"" Zelenskiy tweeted. Zelenskiy also had a more formal meeting in Glasgow with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who ""reaffirmed the United States' unwavering support for Ukraine's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity,"" a State Department statement said.

The Ukrainian army is locked in a simmering conflict with pro-Russian separatists that erupted after Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014.

Under pressure from Kiev's Western allies, Moscow later announced a pullback, but both Ukraine and the United States said at the time the withdrawal was limited.

Russia has been mustering military units on its border with Ukraine this month, in moves the EU on Friday called ""rather worrying,"" as the long-running standoff between the two becomes more unpredictable. But although the buildup comes amid unusually high tensions between Russia and the West, exacerbated by suspicions of Moscow’s involvement in Belarus’s migration crisis, U.S. navy exercises in the Black Sea, and Europe’s gas supply crisis, analysts in Russia and abroad are cautious to draw conclusions about an imminent Russian attack. “To be quite honest, I don’t see any grounds to expect an invasion,” said Andrei Kortunov, head of the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC), a Kremlin-aligned think tank. ""I don’t know what it would achieve. The losses would be huge, and the potential gains very limited."" For several weeks now, a steady trickle of information has appeared to suggest a return to hostilities in a conflict that has been mostly dormant in the seven years since Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula and reportedly sponsored a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s Russian-speaking east. Footage purporting to show Russian military hardware being moved towards Ukraine has been widely shared on social media. Meanwhile, satellite imagery of military deployments along the western frontier with Ukraine and Belarus — where separate armed exercises have been seen as a statement of political support for embattled Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko — appears to show a Russian army getting ready to move. According to Ukrainian government estimates, 114,000 Russian military personnel are now deployed in close proximity to Ukraine’s northern, southern and eastern borders. In many ways, the development resembles an earlier buildup of Russian forces in March and April this year, which sparked speculation of an imminent assault, before the troops were suddenly pulled back. Against this backdrop, Bloomberg has reported that U.S. officials have briefed European counterparts on a possible Russian assault on Ukraine. Rob Lee, a Eurasia fellow at U.S. think tank the Foreign Policy Research Institute said he doubts Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to conduct a large-scale invasion of Ukraine ""He wants to use force, or the threat of force, to get Ukraine and NATO to make concessions."" The recent increase in tensions comes on the back of years of souring ties between Moscow and Kiev. Moscow had once hoped that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a native Russian-speaker from the country’s east, might be amenable to making a deal to end the war that began when Russia-backed separatists seized Ukraine’s eastern Donbass provinces. Instead, Zelenskiy has presided over a steady worsening of relations with Russia since his election in 2019. Pressure on pro-Russian media and politicians in Ukraine, including treason charges against Viktor Medvedchuk, a Ukrainian lawmaker and longtime personal friend of Vladimir Putin, have infected the two sides’ relations with more bitterness than usual. The Minsk Protocol — a 2015 deal on a potential outline to end the war — has been mostly forgotten, with ceasefires broken and low-level fighting continuing. Meanwhile, deepening military cooperation with NATO countries, including the purchase of Turkish Bayraktar military drones earlier this year, has brought things to a head. For Russia, which has long opposed Ukraine’s entry into the U.S.-led military pact, a recent tranche of Western arms supplies and weapons deals for Kiev has raised the prospect of the country moving decisively into the NATO camp. Though formal NATO membership for Ukraine is not an immediate prospect, the Kremlin warned in September that expanding the alliance’s presence in Ukraine would still constitute a crossing of Russia’s so-called ""red lines."" In particular, the issue of drones — which were used to shell Donbass separatist positions for the first time last month — is an emotive one. In last year’s war in the separatist Nagorno-Karabakh enclave, Azerbaijan used Bayraktar drones purchased from Turkey to defeat Armenian forces and achieve a decisive victory in what had been one of the former Soviet Union’s longest running frozen conflicts. Some in Moscow worry that Ukraine may now be looking to build up its arsenals in preparation for a future decisive offensive in the Donbass. ""Zelenskiy might try to become a Ukrainian Aliev,"" said RIAC’s Kortunov, referring to the Azerbaijani president who led his country to victory in Nagorno-Karabakh. However, for many in Moscow, the fear is less of a concrete Ukrainian plan to resolve the Donbass issue than of a broader sense that the seven-year-old frozen conflict is becoming increasingly unpredictable. With Zelenskiy’s approval ratings falling to record lows, some imagine that he might attempt to rally his base by fulfilling pre-election promises to resolve the Donbass conflict ahead of presidential polls scheduled for 2024. Moreover, with a fresh summit between the Russian and American presidents in the works, the Kremlin reportedly worries that Ukraine, if undeterred, may scupper the modest thaw in U.S.-Russia relations since June’s Biden-Putin summit in Geneva. ""The fear in Moscow is that Ukrainian hawks might opt for further provocations to try to pull Russia into a full-scale confrontation,"" said Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of R.Politik, a political analysis firm. In any case, experts stress that the 114,000 Russian personnel allegedly on the border would not be sufficient to defeat Ukraine’s armed forces, estimated at around 255,000. With Ukraine having already resisted a Russian invasion in 2014 — when its army was much weaker — the costs of invading and occupying the country would likely far exceed the military units currently rallied on the Russian side of the border. ""We shouldn’t overestimate the scale of what’s going on at the border,"" said the RIAC’s Kortunov. ""There aren’t enough forces there right now to undertake a serious operation. Right now, this looks like deterrence more than anything.""",1,971,97.31,33.08,57.46,2.93,28.56,35.02,79.51,56.44,43.05,3.91,1.03,0.21,0.1,0,0.62,0,2.88,14.11,9.58,1.54,16.37,5.66,2.99,3.81,0.62,11.12,6.9,4.12,7.72,0.82,1.44,6.08,11.53,0,11.43,1.75,1.85,1.24,2.78,0.1,2.57,0.1,4.33,0.93,3.4,1.13,0.1,1.03,0.62,0.31,0,0,6.39,3.71,0.31,0,1.44,0.31,1.13,2.06,0,0,0,0.62,7.11,4.12,2.68,0.31,1.85,0,0,1.34,0.51,0,0.51,0.21,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.21,0.31,0.51,0.21,0.31,0,0.1,0.51,0.1,3.09,13.08,0.21,1.96,9.78,1.13,0,0.41,4.74,3.91,3.81,2.37,0.1,0.1,0,0,0,16.99,4.63,5.97,0,0,2.37,4.02

He said the 27-nation bloc was monitoring the situation with partners including the United States and Britain and ""we are open to look at further steps as necessary."" U.S. top diplomat Antony Blinken on Wednesday warned Russia against making another ""serious mistake"" on Ukraine as Washington sought clarity about troop movements near the border. Welcoming Ukraine's foreign minister to Washington, Secretary of State Blinken said that the U.S. was ""concerned with reports of the unusual Russian activity near Ukraine."" ""We don't have clarity into Moscow's intentions, but we do know its playbook,"" Blinken told a joint news conference. ""Our concern is that Russia may make the serious mistake of attempting to rehash what it undertook back in 2014 when it amassed forces along the border, crossed into sovereign Ukrainian territory and did so claiming falsely that it was provoked,"" he said. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the Russian movement was ""unusual in its size and scope."" ""It's not exactly clear what the Russian intentions are,"" he said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov insisted on Friday that Russia ""does not pose a threat to anyone"" and accused NATO countries of increasing ""provocative actions."" ""We mind our own affairs and take measures to ensure our security if necessary, if there are provocative actions of our opponents near our borders,"" Peskov said.

Leading  Provocative  Exercises in Black Sea,English,Russia,"Russian President Vladimir Putin told French counterpart Emmanuel Macron on Monday that ""provocative"" U.S.-led exercises in the Black Sea were ""increasing tensions"" between Moscow and NATO, the Kremlin said. Both leaders expressed ""dissatisfaction"" with what Moscow called a ""worsening"" situation in eastern Ukraine, the Kremlin statement said. Putin ""drew attention to the provocative nature of the large scale exercises led by the United States and its allies in the Black Sea which are increasing tensions between Russia and NATO,"" the Kremlin said. Putin's comments came after Western countries raised alarm over Russian military activities near Ukraine. According to the Elysee, Macron told Putin that France was ready to defend Ukraine's territorial integrity. Last week, Putin said that the Kremlin considered recent Black Sea exercises by the U.S. and other NATO ships as a serious challenge. He told state television that Russia's Defense Ministry ""had a proposal to hold its own unplanned exercises in the same waters."" ""But I believe that this is inappropriate and there is no need to further escalate the situation,"" he said. Putin seemingly referred to several U.S. warships taking part in exercises in the Black Sea which Moscow has said it was ""monitoring."" According to the Kremlin statement, Putin also criticized Ukraine for the ""recent use"" of drones in its conflict with pro-Russia rebels. Last month, Kiev released footage of what it said was its first use of the Turkish-made TB2 Bayraktar drone against separatists. Putin said this violates peace agreements signed in Minsk in 2015. U.S. top diplomat Antony Blinken warned Moscow last week against making another ""serious mistake"" on Ukraine as Washington sought clarity about troop movements near the border. The EU has said it was also concerned by Russian military activities close to the border. The 27-nation bloc said it was monitoring the situation with partners, including the U.S. and Britain. The accusations come amid rising tensions between the EU and Moscow over a migrant stand-off on the border between Poland and Kremlin-allied Belarus.

CIA chief William Burns was in Russia for two days of meetings with top officials at the request of President Joe Biden, the U.S. Embassy has said. CNN reported last week that Burns had been sent to Moscow to warn the Kremlin about the alleged build-up of troops near Ukraine's border. It said that after his meetings in Russia, Burns spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy by phone. The Kremlin's spokesman said on Monday that Putin and Burns discussed bilateral ties, ""regional conflicts"" and a crisis in diplomatic relations. He did not provide further details. Burns, who was the U.S. ambassador to Russia in 2005-2008, visited Moscow during a severe crisis in ties between Moscow and Washington.

Capitol Rioter Seeks Asylum in Belarus – State TV,English,Russia,"A man on the FBI’s Most Wanted List for allegedly attacking police during the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot is now seeking asylum in Belarus, the ex-Soviet country’s state-run television reported Sunday. Evan Neumann, 48, is wanted in the United States on charges of violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, as well as for assaulting, resisting and obstructing law enforcement during civil disorder. Neumann denies the charges as “unfounded.” Neumann sold his California home in spring and was thought to have moved to Ukraine to evade arrest, ABC News reported this summer. “Judging by his story, [Neumann] is the same type of simple American whose shops were burned by Black Lives Matter activists,” a Belarus 1 TV channel presenter said, echoing a common talking point on Russian state television. Neumann “sought justice and asked uncomfortable questions” following the 2020 U.S. elections disputed by ex-President Donald Trump, the presenter added, “but lost almost everything and is being persecuted by the U.S. government.” Belarusian border authorities detained Neumann on the border with Ukraine on Aug. 15, Belarus 1 reported. “This situation has not only never happened, but was difficult to imagine,” said the channel’s reporter in a segment titled “Goodbye, America!” In a sit-down interview, Neumann recalled crossing swampy forests and meeting wild hogs and snakes in his journey from Ukraine to Belarus. Belarus 1 reported that Neumann traveled from the U.S. to Italy in March, then took a train to Switzerland and drove to Germany and Poland before settling in western Ukraine, where he had rented an apartment for four months. Neumann said he noticed Ukrainian security services “following” him two weeks into his stay, which prompted him to cross into neighboring Belarus and seek asylum. Belarusian migration authorities declined to comment, citing confidentiality of personal data, the Russian state-run RIA Novosti reported Monday. At least three U.S. citizens have applied for asylum in Belarus so far in 2021, the outlet added. Belarus meanwhile has been accused of orchestrating a wave of migrants and refugees, mainly from the Middle East, toward European Union members' borders in retaliation to EU sanctions.

That brings the agency's tally of Covid-19 deaths in Russia to nearly 450,000, the highest toll in Europe. A Moscow Times analysis places Russia’s excess death toll since the start of the coronavirus pandemic at 723,000. Lockdown in Russia New coronavirus restrictions came into effect across Russia on Saturday with authorities looking to stem soaring infections and deaths in Europe's worst hit country by fatalities. The paid holiday lasts until next Sunday and can be extended if Covid-19 cases do not fall. Russia has held back on imposing significant nationwide measures since ending a short lockdown at the beginning of the pandemic and instead placed its hopes on the rollout of several homegrown vaccines, including Sputnik V.  Sputnik woes Russian President Vladimir Putin complained Saturday about lack of international recognition for its Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine at a G20 summit, where leaders agreed to step up global inoculation efforts. ""This happens mainly because of dishonest competition, protectionism and because some states, especially those of the G20, are not ready for mutual recognition of vaccines and vaccination certificates,"" Putin said in video message comments to counterparts. Not our drone Turkey is not responsible for Ukraine's use of an Ankara-made drone in its conflict with pro-Moscow rebels, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said in comments published on Sunday. ""If a state buys (weaponry) from us, it's no longer a Turkish product. It might be manufactured in Turkey, but it belongs to Ukraine,"" Cavusoglu told reporters after meeting his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, on the margins of the G20 summit in Rome. Ukraine last week said it destroyed the artillery of pro-Russian separatists in the country’s east using a Bayraktar TB2k, its first combat deployment of a Turkish drone. The Kremlin had later said that Ankara’s supply of drones to Kiev risks destabilizing the eastern Ukraine conflict despite Russia’s “special” relations with Turkey. No cheeky matter Police on Saturday detained 31-year-old model Irina Volkova for posing in thong underwear in front of St. Isaac’s Cathedral in St. Petersburg on charges of “insulting religious feelings.” A court, which said the graphic photo dates back to the summer of 2020, ruled Sunday to release Volkova from custody.

Saakashvili, who served as president between 2004 and 2013, was arrested on Oct. 1 on his return from exile in Ukraine. He has refused food for 39 days to protest against his imprisonment, which he says is politically motivated. His jailing has exacerbated a political crisis that erupted last year after the opposition denounced fraud in parliamentary elections won narrowly by the ruling Georgian Dream party. The guards ""abused me verbally, punched me on the neck, dragged me on the ground by my hair"", Saakashvili said in a letter released through his lawyer, adding that his controversial transfer to a prison hospital was ""aimed at killing"" him. He was moved on Monday to a prison hospital that rights officials say fails to ensure his proper treatment. The flamboyant pro-Western reformer's arrest provoked the largest anti-government demonstrations in a decade. Chanting Saakashvili's name, about 40,000 demonstrators flooded on Monday evening into the central Freedom Square in the Georgian capital Tbilisi, AFP reporters saw. ""A mass, permanent protest movement begins in Georgia and will not stop until Mikheil Saakashvili is set free and snap elections are called,"" Nika Melia, the chairman of Saakashvili's United National Movement party, told the crowd. ""We will not disperse, our protest will be relentless and peaceful, we will not let the regime provoke us to a civil confrontation."" Protesters then marched through downtown Tbilisi towards the prime minister's office, vowing to blockade the building. Prime Minister Irakli ""Garibashvili will not be able to leave or enter his office,"" Melia said. One of the demonstrators, businessman Niko Mgeladze, 46, said: ""Saakashvili is a victim of political vendetta, we will not stop until he is liberated."" The pro-opposition Mtavari TV station aired footage of hundreds of riot police being deployed outside government buildings. On Monday morning, doctors who examined Saakashvili said he was ""at high risk of multi-systemic complications and needs to be urgently treated in a high-tech clinic."" Georgia's rights ombudswoman Nino Lomjaria said the prison hospital failed to meet the doctors' criteria. Doctors have said Saakashvili faces an imminent risk of death as he has an underlying blood disorder that makes his hunger strike particularly dangerous. Ukraine protested against Saakashvili's transfer to a prison hospital, saying the move ""creates additional risks."" ""We call on the Georgian side to transfer Mikheil Saakashvili to a civilian medical facility without delay,"" the foreign ministry said in a note of protest sent to Tbilisi. Saakashvili, who was stripped of his Georgian passport in 2015, is now a national of Ukraine, where he headed — until his arrest — a government agency steering reforms. Saakashvili's lawyers have expressed concerns that his ""security will not be guaranteed in the prison hospital where convicted criminals are employed as paramedics."" The independent Pirveli TV channel reported that inmates in the prison hospital staged a noisy protest against Saakashvili, shouting profanities at the man who led a relentless campaign against organized crime during his tenure as president. Lomjaria, who visited Saakashvili in custody, said he was moved to a prison hospital against his will and was misled that he was to be transferred to a civilian clinic. Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili sparked an uproar recently by saying that Saakashvili ""has the right to commit suicide"" and that the government had been forced to arrest him because he refused to quit politics.",1,583,91.09,72.6,6.12,2.25,23.32,33.96,81.82,54.2,42.54,9.26,7.55,0.69,1.03,0,4.8,0,1.72,12.86,8.23,1.54,14.41,6.69,1.03,3.43,1.03,13.72,3.43,1.54,11.49,1.54,1.37,8.58,4.97,0,4.8,0.51,1.37,0.17,0.17,0.17,2.57,0,5.15,1.2,3.95,0.34,0,0.34,0.17,0.17,0,0,16.3,7.2,0,0,2.4,0.34,4.29,8.92,0,0,0.17,4.97,4.29,3.95,0,0.34,4.97,0.69,0,3.77,0.17,0.51,4.12,2.57,1.2,0,0.17,0,0,0.51,0.51,0.86,0,0,0.34,0,0,0.17,1.03,0.34,2.4,6.86,0.34,1.89,4.46,0.17,0.34,0,4.46,6.35,3.09,1.54,0,0,0,0,0,16.47,4.29,5.66,0,0,1.54,4.97

Bonner said he plans to retire after preserving the Kyiv Post’s archives. Reporters at Kyiv Post accused Kivan of attempting to “infringe” on the paper’s editorial independence with plans to expand the Kyiv Post with a Ukrainian-language edition. “We see this as the owner getting rid of inconvenient, fair and honest journalists,” they said in a joint statement posted on staff writer Anna Myroniuk’s Facebook page. “We consider the cessation of publication and the dismissal of the paper’s staff to be an act of vengeance by Adnan Kivan,” the reporters added. Kivan is a native of Syria who moved to Soviet Ukraine in the early 1980s and is now among the country’s wealthiest people. According to the U.S.-funded RFE/RL news organization, Kivan’s company Kadorr Group did not immediately comment on the Kyiv Post reporters’ allegations.

During a meeting with senior Defense Ministry officials, Putin said the military already had more than 2,000 drones at its disposal. ""More work must be done on this... in particular through the use of artificial intelligence and the latest scientific and technological advances,"" he said in remarks released by the Kremlin. Putin said drones had proven their effectiveness in recent conflicts and that Russia had developed defenses against their use, including against ""terrorist drone attacks"" in Syria. ""We have learned how to repel these attacks and are doing it effectively,"" Putin said. Drone development is part of a major push for weapons development under Putin, who has made increased Russian military might a cornerstone of his two-decade rule. A new generation of the Sukhoi stealth fighter jet — dubbed ""The Checkmate"" — was unveiled earlier this year with the ability to carry and launch drones in flight. Russia has also taken the lead in developing hypersonic missiles, which can fly more than five times the speed of sound and maneuver in mid-flight, making them hard to track and intercept. Turkey and Israel have been selling drones in the former Soviet Union and they played a key role Azerbaijan's victory over Armenia in last year's Nagorno-Karabakh war. Russia last month raised concerns about Ukraine's first drone attack — using a Turkish-made TB2 Bayraktar drone — on pro-Moscow separatists, saying it could ""destabilize"" the frontline in eastern Ukraine.",1,254,92,49.43,38.67,15.8,23.09,30.31,76.38,57.87,43.31,6.69,3.54,0,0.39,0,1.18,1.57,3.15,12.2,6.69,1.57,15.75,7.09,1.97,4.72,0,14.17,5.91,4.33,8.66,0.79,2.76,5.91,10.63,0,9.84,1.57,2.76,1.57,0.39,1.18,3.54,0,4.33,1.97,2.36,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.24,5.51,0,0,1.57,0,3.15,4.72,0,0,0,1.18,4.33,1.57,0.79,1.97,2.36,0.39,0,1.57,0.39,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.39,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.97,9.45,0.39,2.36,5.91,0,0.39,0.39,5.91,7.09,1.97,0.39,0,0,0,0,0,16.54,5.12,3.94,0,0,1.57,5.91

Western response U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian about ""concerning"" Russian military activity taking place ""in and near Ukraine,"" the State Department said late Sunday.

The deportation of Tom Vennink, Dutch daily de Volkskrant's Russia correspondent, follows BBC correspondent Sarah Rainsford's expulsion in August. Russian authorities revoked Vennink’s residence permit on Monday and gave him three days to leave the country over two administrative fines dating back years, according to de Volkskrant. He was fined in 2019 for failing to register with migration authorities on time and in 2020 for visiting the restricted border security zone of Chukotka in far northeastern Siberia. Moscow informed the Dutch government that Vennink’s visa cannot be extended on Wednesday morning, de Volkskrant said. Vennink, who has worked as de Volkskrant’s Moscow correspondent since 2015, is not allowed back in Russia until January 2025. De Volkskrant editor-in-chief Pieter Klok said it was unusual for Russian authorities to deport a foreign correspondent due to old infractions. “It’s a mystery to us why the Russian government has decided this now,” Klok said. “Such administrative offenses were never an obstacle to extending residence permits in previous years,” he added. Dutch Foreign Minister Ben Knapen said “it’s not acceptable for the Netherlands if a journalist has to leave a country against his will.” Knapen added that the ministry’s last-minute attempts to prevent the journalist’s expulsion from Russia yielded no results.

""If they impose additional sanctions on us... we must respond,"" Lukashenko said in comments to officials in Minsk released by the presidency. ""We are warming Europe, and they are threatening us,"" he said, pointing out that Russia's Yamal-Europe gas pipeline transits through Belarus to Poland. ""And what if we halt natural gas supplies?"" Pressure is building to address the plight of hundreds of migrants, mainly Kurds from the Middle East, who are stuck at the Belarus-Poland border in freezing weather. The UN Security Council was to meet later Thursday for emergency talks on the crisis, after international appeals to deal with the refugees' plight. The West accuses Lukashenko of luring the migrants to Belarus to send them across the border, in revenge for sanctions imposed last year after a heavy crackdown on the opposition. EU officials say they expect to approve new sanctions over the migrant crisis next week. Poland has deployed 15,000 troops along the border, put up a fence topped with barbed wire and approved construction of a wall on the frontier with Belarus. In a statement released for Poland's Independence Day on Thursday, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said his country was facing a ""new kind of war"" whose ""ammunition is civilians."" Poland accuses Belarus of using intimidation to force migrants to breach the frontier and refusing to allow them to leave border areas. Belarus has in turn accused Poland of violating international norms by blocking the migrants and violently beating them back. Migrants have been trying to cross the border for months but the crisis came to a head when hundreds made a concerted effort on Monday and were pushed back by Polish border guards. They set up a camp on the border, sheltering in tents and burning wood from local forests to keep warm, blocked by Polish guards behind razor-wire. Belarus says some 2,000 people are living at the camp. Teams from the UN refugee agency, the International Organization for Migration and the Red Cross visited the camp on Thursday to check on conditions and deliver aid, including hygiene kits and diapers. ""Priorities now are to prevent loss of life and move people to safer locations in Belarus,"" UNHCR chief Filippo Grandi said on Twitter. Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis told reporters his country was pushing for an evacuation corridor from the border to the Belarusian city of Grodno, which has an airport that could be used to send people back to their home countries. The migrants have been making sporadic attempts to cross, with Polish border guards reporting 468 attempts overnight Thursday. At least 10 migrants have died on the border, seven of them on the Polish side, according to Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza. Journalists and charity workers have been banned from the immediate border area by Polish authorities under state of emergency rules. Residents in the Polish town of Sokolka near the border said they were worried by the growing tensions but voiced support for the Polish government's tough stance. ""I'm afraid of the migrants getting through and what the consequences would be,"" said Henryk Lenkiewicz, a 67-year-old pensioner walking by a community noticeboard in the town center. European leaders have been putting pressure on Lukashenko's main backer, Russian President Vladimir Putin. German Chancellor Angela Merkel telephoned Putin on Wednesday to ask him ""to use his influence"" to stop what she called an ""inhumane"" instrumentalization of migrants. Poland has accused Putin of masterminding the crisis, a claim the Kremlin has dismissed as ""irresponsible."" France's Europe Minister Clement Beaune said Thursday there was no evidence that Russia was involved in trafficking migrants, adding it should be ""part of the solution because Belarus is more and more dependent on Moscow.""

The Kremlin came under scrutiny earlier this year from France and Germany over a reported deal to send 1,000 fighters from the Kremlin-linked Wagner mercenary group to the conflict-ridden state. ""We realize the need to support Mali's ability to combat terrorism,"" Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said during talks in Moscow with his Malian counterpart, Abdoulaye Diop. ""We provide the country with the necessary equipment, weapons and ammunition. We will do whatever is necessary to prevent threats to Mali's statehood and territorial integrity,"" Lavrov said. He said questions over the role of Russian mercenaries in the country should be directed to Malian authorities and that military initiatives established by private Russian citizens were not Moscow's official business. ""Regarding reports on the Malian government's plans to apply for a Russian PMC's (private military contractor's) services... this question is exclusively within the jurisdiction of the legitimate Malian government,"" Lavrov said. ""If those contracts are concluded with legitimate governments of sovereign states, I don't understand what can be seen as negative about that,"" he added. Reports of the Wagner deal came as France is preparing to close bases in Mali where its military has been fighting an Islamist insurgency since 2013.

Yet several unresolved issues had marred the Moldova-Russia gas relationship, notably accumulated debt, which played a major role in the crisis. Moldova’s gas consumption is very small at about 2.9 billion cubic meters (bcm), of which right-bank Moldova consumes about 1.3 bcm, while the breakaway republic of Transnistria consumes the rest. Moldova has no gas production of its own, and its national gas company, Moldovagaz, imports 100 percent of the country’s requirements from Gazprom. Moldovagaz owns the gas transmission network, as well as local supply and distribution companies. Gazprom owns 50 percent of Moldovagaz, with the remaining shares split between the Moldovan central government (36.6 percent) and the administration of the Transnistrian region (13.4 percent). Although Moldova is de facto a partitioned country (the Moldovan central government has no control over Transnistria), Moldovagaz is de jure a unified gas company, and all supply and transit contracts are concluded between Gazprom and Moldovagaz. It is understood that supply contracts stipulate volumes to be delivered to right-bank Moldova and Transnistria separately, with payments also made separately. Debt accumulation has been a constant feature of Russian-Moldovan gas trade throughout the post-Soviet period, with both right-bank Moldova and Transnistria running high debts, although the former’s debt has been significantly lower — and the payment discipline significantly higher — than the latter’s. By October 2021, Moldova’s gas debt stood at about $709 million (principal debt is about $433 million) for right-bank Moldova and about $7 billion for Transnistria. Prior to the end of September 2021, Gazprom supplied gas to Moldova under a 2006 five-year contract that had been extended on an annual basis. That contract, whose price formula was originally based on oil price indexation, was set to expire on September 30, 2021. Under the contract, the average annual price in 2020 was about $148 per thousand cubic meters (mcm). The second half of 2020 saw exceptionally low European gas hub prices, with the Dutch TTF hub price falling to about $75/mcm. The prevailing expectation was that low prices would continue into 2021, thus giving Moldova every incentive to seek some degree of hub price indexation. The Moldovan government apparently sought to negotiate a new contract that would give it more beneficial terms. Although no new contract was signed, the old contract was amended in January 2021 to introduce the German NCG month-ahead hub indexation for the warmer months — the second and third quarters of 2021— while preserving oil price indexation for the first and fourth quarters. Contrary to expectations, European hub prices did not remain at the low level, but started to increase in late 2020, having reached about $300/mcm by January 2021, before falling briefly to about $200/mcm by March 2021, and then increasing sharply and seemingly inexorably to about $900/mcm in September 2021, with a particularly steep rise occurring from August onwards. As some of that increase fed through the contract, the price for Moldova in September 2021 increased to $550/mcm. Suddenly oil price indexation started to look far more beneficial than hub indexation. Meanwhile, witnessing the European gas hubs’ price rally, Moldova never publicly said it wanted to extend the old contract, which would have ensured supplies at lower than hub prices, as its provisions stipulated oil-indexed prices for the fourth and first quarters. Rather, it continued to seek a new gas contract with Gazprom, although reportedly made no serious effort to negotiate it prior to the old contract nearing expiry. The new contract was one of the key issues discussed during the meeting in Chisinau on August 11 between Moldovan President Maia Sandu and Russia’s presidential envoy Dmitry Kozak. Kozak talked positively about the prospects for the new contract, saying that a “mutually beneficial” solution was needed. With the old contract about to expire, no new contract was yet in sight. Gazprom reportedly offered a hub-indexed price (about $790/mcm) with a 25 percent discount, which was conditional on debt repayment over a period of time, whereas Moldova had asked for a 50 percent discount. The price, although high, was reflective of the European gas market. As the parties failed to agree, Moldova asked Gazprom to extend the old contract for October. This request was made on the expiry date of the old contract: September 30. The contract was extended on the same conditions as in September (hub-indexed), resulting in a price of $790/mcm for October. It was not until the old contract expired—and it became clear that talks on a new contract had failed —that Moldova publicly said it wanted to extend the old contract on its previous terms. As Moldova only asked to extend the contract on September 30, Gazprom was unable to book corresponding capacity at an auction held on September 20 in accordance with the EU Capacity Allocation Mechanism (CAM) Network Code, as a result of which Moldova contracted only 54 million cubic meters (mmcm) for its right-bank consumption — the amount for which Gazprom had sufficient capacity under previous bookings — compared with the region’s 80 mmcm monthly consumption for October. As the ensuing shortage led to linepack gas in the Moldovan gas transmission system starting to be used, Moldova introduced a state of emergency on October 22 through November 20 to procure alternative supplies for balancing the grid. For several days, Moldova bought or borrowed additional gas — about 5 mmcm — from other suppliers (such as PGNiG, ERU, Vitol, and DXT) to complement its gas balance and prevent pressure from decreasing to critical levels. That gas was extremely expensive (supplies from PGNiG were about $1100/mcm at the TTF day-ahead rate), but no gas was available at lower prices. Since hubs are the prevalent price formation mechanism in Europe, no European supplier would sell gas to Moldova at a lower price. These purchases made it abundantly clear to Moldova that the only affordable way out of the imminent gas crisis was to secure a contract with Gazprom at a price lower than the hub-based price. It is unclear why the talks on the new contract collapsed. Russian President Vladimir Putin was one of the first world leaders to congratulate Sandu on her convincing victory in Moldova’s presidential elections in December 2020, and his envoy Kozak was the first high-ranking official to visit Moldova after its pro-European government took office in August 2021. As noted above, the Sandu-Kozak meeting sounded very positive. Russia stood to win nothing from a gas standoff with Moldova, either commercially or in PR terms, as it was certain to result in yet more accusations of using gas as a weapon. It seems much more likely that Moldova wanted (and may have been encouraged) to conclude only a short-term contract with Gazprom and not to accept its conditions—including on debt repayment and how to implement the EU acquis with regard to (Gazprom co-owned) Moldovagaz—while hoping there would be a safety net provided should the negotiations fail. No such safety net materialized. As the crisis was unfolding, the EU provided Moldova with financial assistance worth 60 million euros (the equivalent of about two-thirds of Moldova’s monthly consumption at current hub prices) “to set up a support scheme for the most vulnerable people,” but otherwise remained largely on the sidelines. Moldovan Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita asked the EU for help, saying that without a contract with Gazprom, Moldova would need to spend about 800 million euros over the next five months on alternative imports at market prices to meet its winter demand. The EU High Representative for Foreign Policy Josep Borrell said on October 28 that the solution to the crisis would “not come from the European Union funding all the differences between the current prices and the prices that Gazprom is asking for.” The EU’s message could hardly have been clearer, and Moldova signed its contract with Gazprom on the following day, October 29. On October 29, Gazprom and Moldovagaz signed a five-year contract, and supply began on November 1. The contract is understood to be an extension of the old one, with some adjustments. Although the formula has not been published, it reportedly takes into account the price of oil and gas in the preceding nine months, with 70 percent being indexed to oil prices and 30 percent to hub gas prices, with adjustments to be made quarterly. The price for November is about $450/mcm (over 60 percent less than the current hub prices at which Moldova bought balancing gas in the preceding days, and over 40 percent less than the contract hub-indexed price at which it bought gas from Gazprom in October). As before, Russian gas will be delivered at the Moldova-Ukraine border, thus enabling supplies both to right-bank Moldova and Transnistria (through which it will transit). In addition to the contract, a separate protocol was signed aimed at resolving prior disagreements. It addresses inter alia two specific problems that have complicated the Moldova-Russia gas relationship: the accumulation of debt, and the implementation of unbundling provisions of the EU acquis in respect of Moldovagaz. As stated in the protocol, Moldovagaz and Gazprom agreed to conduct an independent audit of Moldovagaz’s debt (with regard to supplies to right-bank Moldova) in 2022 to confirm the amount owed, with further negotiations to be held on the method and the repayment schedule. The protocol stipulates that the amount of debt is to be confirmed by May 2022 and paid back over a five-year period. The protocol also addresses the issue of Moldovagaz’s restructuring. As a contracting party of the Energy Community Treaty (EnCT), Moldova has committed to implement the EU energy acquis, including its unbundling provisions, under which Moldovagaz’s transmission activities would have to be separated from its supply activities. Gazprom, which owns 50 percent of shares in Moldovagaz, stands to be affected by unbundling, not least by the lack of certainty as to what entity will pay the debt once restructuring is complete. The protocol ensures forced restructuring will not be possible until full settlement of the debt, in the amount confirmed by the audit. Notably, the acquis allows for several unbundling models: ownership unbundling, which would necessitate the transmission network being sold off, is not mandatory, and other models allowing for the preservation of network ownership are also possible. It is easy to imagine that Gazprom’s concern over who will pay the debt once Moldovagaz’s unbundling is complete was construed as trying to force Moldova not to implement the EU acquis or undermining its government, thus giving rise to easy (and somewhat lazy) — but unconvincing — narratives of Russia having provoked the crisis to undermine Moldova’s new pro-European government. While there have been allegations of Russia imposing political conditions on Moldova — such as Chisinau’s withdrawal from the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area — in exchange for signing the contract, and the EU’s Borrell referred—without offering evidence—to “attempts by Gazprom to put political pressure in return to lower the gas prices,” both Sandu and Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Spinu have stated that no political conditions were attached as part of Moldova’s agreeing to the contract. The Russian-Moldovan gas relationship has always been heavily skewed in Russia’s favor because of Moldova’s high dependence on Russian gas imports, for which it was not able to pay in full and on time, and its relatively minor transit role compared to Ukraine and Belarus. The nature of this asymmetry has changed over time due to the construction of the TurkStream gas pipeline from Russia to Turkey, which has reduced Moldova’s transit role further, and the new Romania-Moldova interconnector (owned by the Romanian national gas company Transgaz), which enables Moldova to import gas from suppliers other than Gazprom, at least in the amount needed for its right-bank consumption. Having the technical ability to import gas from other suppliers strengthened Moldova’s position vis-à-vis Gazprom in that the latter is unable to demand a price for its gas higher than the price set by the European hubs. Of course, there is nothing to stop Gazprom from offering Moldova a discount on that price if it wishes to do so. At a time when European hub prices are at historic highs, the conclusion of the new five-year contract with Gazprom—which has elements of both gas hub and oil price indexation, and a nine-month lag, making it possible to even out the impact of high prices and volatility over time—is a positive development for Moldova, securing its gas supply balance ahead of winter and alleviating serious pressure on its very weak finances. While Gazprom has been able to rein in right-bank Moldova’s debt, its ability to extract payment from Transnistria, which has accumulated about $7 billion of debt, remains seriously constrained by the region’s undefined status. A lasting political solution of Transnistria’s “frozen” conflict would be conducive to the improved economic performance of Moldova (including Transnistria), and would enhance its ability to pay for its gas imports in the future — both from Gazprom and other suppliers. A broader point in European-Russian gas relations is that despite a significant—and successful — effort made by the EU in the 2010s to diversify supplies and reduce the dependence of its most vulnerable member states on Russian gas, Russia will continue to remain an important supplier of gas both to the EU and non-EU countries in the shared EU-Russia neighborhood — Moldova, Belarus, and non-EU Balkan countries —due to the competitiveness of its gas. The Moldovan crisis has demonstrated that no European supplier will sell gas at a price below hub level and that any country — especially where the EU acquis is being implemented — can be sure that Gazprom’s price will not be higher than the price set by the European hubs (which makes Gazprom a supplier like any other) and may be lower (which could make Gazprom a preferred supplier in countries with weaker economies). The ongoing European gas supply crunch this winter has demonstrated the limitations of EU diversification efforts. It is important to recognize this and encourage countries in the shared EU-Russia neighborhood to create gas markets on which both Gazprom and non-Gazprom exporters can compete.",1,2377,96.36,20.21,32.98,37.14,32.12,31.26,78.67,58.86,45.52,4.21,0.17,0,0,0,0.08,0,4.04,14.39,8.71,3.79,17.59,5.72,2.94,5.26,1.01,9.51,6.65,6.69,3.83,0.55,1.22,2.19,9.59,0.8,8.79,1.09,1.47,1.26,1.22,0.29,3.58,0,2.31,1.72,0.55,0.13,0.08,0,0,0,0,0,3.79,2.82,0.38,0.17,0.21,0.08,0.97,0.72,0,0,0.04,0.04,2.1,1.18,0.8,0.13,7.78,0.13,0.08,3.37,4.25,0.08,0.21,0.13,0,0,0,0,0,0.04,0,0.67,0.21,0.67,0.08,0.25,0,0.42,0.5,0.04,2.02,7.03,0.29,0.46,6.18,0.21,0.04,0.08,5.72,4.71,2.23,0.97,0.04,0,0.04,0,0,14.51,3.28,4.63,0,0,1.26,5.34
55,themoscowtimes.com,1636358400,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/11/08/in-russias-south-the-remains-of-a-greek-city-hint-at-cosmopolitan-past-a75501,"In Russia South , the Remains of a Greek City Hint at Cosmopolitan Past",English,Russia,"SENNOY, Krasnodar Region — Amid the deep coves and narrow crevices that honeycomb this part of Russia’s Black Sea coast, archaeologists have for eighty years chipped away at one of Europe’s richest historical treasure troves. Ever since Russia conquered the Taman peninsula — a hilly, lagoon-studded spur of land that faces annexed Crimea across the Kerch Strait — in 1828, scholars have puzzled over how Phanagoria, the dynamic Ancient Greek colony it housed, could have thrived for almost two millennia before vanishing almost without trace. “You can find grand stone cities anywhere on the Mediterranean,” said Vladimir Kuznetsov, a 68-year-old archaeologist who has been working on the site since 1978. “But what we have at Phanagoria is different.” Situated outside the small village of Sennoy, Phanagoria, now one of Russia’s best-resourced and highest-profile digs, shines a light not just on the region’s long-lost Ancient Greek heritage, but also on how Russian archaeologists have had to adapt to a difficult financial environment with limited state support. Though archaeologists have been working at Phanagoria on and off since 1936, few of the site’s recent finds would ever have been made, were it not for a chance — and very Russian — twist of fate. In 2004, billionaire industrialist Oleg Deripaska — owner of the RusAl aluminium company and a native of the local Krasnodar region who owns a home a few hours’ drive from Phanagoria — began financing the excavations. His Volnoe Delo charitable foundation has so far donated $16.4 million to the project. Strung out along a remote, uninhabited stretch of a slender cove that burrows its way into the peninsula, rising seas and shifting dunes have buried ancient Phanagoria under an unusually thick layer of sand and swamps. For professional archaeologists — whose work is often obstructed by modern structures — it’s a scientific dream come true. “The archaeological layer here runs six metres deep, with each era in the city’s history preserved on top of the last. It’s very rare to have a layer so deep,” said Kuznetsov. Nestled as it is today between the budget resort villages of the Black Sea riviera and the hypersensitive military bottleneck of the Kerch Strait, it is hard to imagine that the Taman peninsula was once a thriving commercial hub. However, Phanagoria, a Greek colony founded around 543 BC by refugees from the Persian conquest of Anatolia, grew into a prosperous city-state on the back of trade with the Scythian tribes of what is now Ukraine. Though only around two percent of the Phanagoria site has been excavated, finds already testify to a wealthy and powerful settlement, passed down through the succession of empires that have dominated Russia’s southern steppe. There’s the fragment of marble wall engraved with Persian cuneiform text, the only one of its kind ever found outside the former Persian Empire. The menorah-engraved tombstones, evidence that the faith of the Khazars — a tribe of Turkic nomads who converted to Judaism in the first millennium — was present in this part of Russia. Or its Christian diocese, Russia’s oldest, which predates the conversion of Kievan Rus to Christianity by almost 500 years. Phanagoria’s sudden extinction, around the year 1000, remains an archaeological mystery. Historians say a letter discovered in a Cairo archive in the late nineteenth century may hint that early Russian invaders from the north were responsible. Though archaeology has never been chief among rich Russians’ charitable causes, a string of bespoke archaeological funds help wealthy Russians support digs. Deripaska’s support of Phanagoria, however, makes him the single biggest donor to archaeological causes in Russia, and Phanagoria by far the country’s best-financed dig. “For rich Russians, supporting archaeology is a lot like supporting artistic causes,” said Elisabeth Schimpfossl, a senior lecturer at the U.K.’s Aston University and author of a book on rich Russians and their philanthropic habits. “It’s often about filling in gaps where state provision is lacking.” Though individual philanthropy plays a major role in archaeology all around the world, in Russia — where government grants for the field are rare to non-existent — private largesse has assumed particular importance. “In Russia, there is no direct state aid for archaeology,” said Anastasia Stoyanova, an archaeologist and head of Millenium Legacy, a charitable fund supporting digs in Crimea. “There are a few indirect grants but it’s almost impossible to actually get one, and they don’t provide the long-term, year-on-year support you need for a serious project, anyway.” In the absence of meaningful state subsidies, many Russian archaeological projects are financed by so-called “rescue archaeology,” or commercial contracts to excavate construction sites. With developers legally required to pay to excavate lands they plan to build on, Russian archaeologists are often forced to recycle their private earnings from commercial work to support their academic projects themselves. With the broader field’s funding tenuous, Phanagoria has emerged as a lavishly resourced outlier, even as much of the rest of Russia’s archaeological heritage remains underexplored and at risk. “In general, the outlook for archaeology in Russia isn’t great,” said Stoyanova. “There are a handful of sites like Phanagoria, which are very well provided for. But apart from that, the situation is tough.” For Kuznetsov, who recalls working on the Phanagoria site with only his wife during the economic crisis of the 1990s when funding for archaeology withered away, financing from Deripaska — who has been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department — has been transformational. “Not having to worry about your funding does give you a certain freedom,” he said. On the walls of Phanagoria’s luxurious, Deripaska-built visitors’ complex hang photographs of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Defense Minister Sergei Shoygu, both of whom have visited the excavations. Out on the site, the results of the site’s lavish funding are even clearer. Its financing guaranteed, Phanagoria has been able to attract an expansive team of scholars, including numismatists to study the city’s coinage, and anthropologists to reconstruct its everyday life. Analysis of human remains found at the site has enabled the project to make groundbreaking discoveries, including determining an ancient Phanagorian’s life expectancy — 38 years — and to identify the parasites that likely inhabited their bodies. “Without exaggeration, I honestly don’t think there’s a team like ours anywhere else in Russia,” said Kuznetsov. Now, a vast new museum complex is planned to cater for Russian tourists travelling to annexed Crimea on the newly built bridge, which spans the Kerch Strait within view of Phanagoria. For Kuznetsov and his team, however, the focus remains on excavating the as-yet-untouched remainder of the 65-hectare site. One story, of the deposed Byzantine emperor Justinian II who was reputedly exiled to Phanagoria at the turn of the eighth century, has spurred many to wonder what else might be hidden beneath the peninsula’s rolling hills. “If a Byzantine emperor lived here, you’d assume he had a palace,” said Kuznetsov, gesturing toward the gentle, grassy slopes around the digsite. “I just don’t know where it is yet.”",1,1144,93.48,44.72,56.75,37.87,25.42,30.94,78.67,59.44,47.29,5.51,2.71,0.17,0.17,0.52,0.52,0.61,2.8,14.25,9.79,2.45,16.17,6.47,5.86,3.93,0.79,10.66,7.69,4.11,3.58,0.87,0.87,1.92,9.97,0.79,9.18,2.27,1.49,0.52,2.01,0.26,2.97,0.09,2.1,1.66,0.44,0.09,0,0.09,0.09,0,0,0,7.34,3.23,1.57,0,0.17,0,1.05,4.02,0.09,0,0.09,0.52,2.53,0.87,1.66,0,6.56,0.17,0.09,3.23,2.8,0.44,0.61,0.09,0.09,0,0,0,0,0,0.09,0.61,0,0.09,0.17,0,0,0.17,0.26,0.26,3.67,11.1,0.09,0.79,9.62,0.52,0,0.09,4.28,4.2,4.55,0.52,0.26,0.26,0.09,0,0,18.09,4.37,6.73,0,0,2.88,4.11

Escalating  Russia - Ukraine Tensions by Arming Kiev – Kremlin,English,Russia,"The United States is “escalating” the tense situation between Kiev and Moscow by sending weapons and military advisers to Ukraine, the Kremlin said Tuesday. The comments come after CNN reported, citing unnamed sources familiar with the deliberations, that the Biden administration is considering sending Javelin anti-tank missiles, stinger air defense missiles and military advisers to Ukraine amid Western concerns of getting caught by surprise with a possible Russian invasion in January. The Pentagon has also reportedly been pressing Washington to redirect equipment including Russian-made Mi-17 helicopters from its original destination of Afghanistan to Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said military advisers and weapons systems are arriving in Ukraine “not only from the U.S. but other NATO countries.” “This all leads to further escalation,” the state-run TASS news agency quoted Peskov as saying. Peskov also accused the Ukrainian armed forces of making “provocations” with the possible goal of reclaiming southeastern territories lost during its war with pro-Moscow rebels. “We are deeply concerned about the provocative actions of the Ukrainian armed forces on the line of contact and preparations for a possible military solution of the Donbass problem,” he added, referring to the separatist-held Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine. Peskov previously dismissed the claims of Russian troops massing near the Ukraine border as “hysteria” and as non-threatening domestic military moves. “Who’ll be attacking whom? Russia — Ukraine or Ukraine — Russia?” Peskov asked. “We assert that Ukraine is planning aggressive actions against Donbass.” Putin previously blamed the West for “escalating” the Ukraine conflict with Black Sea drills and U.S. bomber flights near Russian borders.

The comments come as Russia musters military units on its border with Ukraine. Moscow has dismissed growing Western claims that Russia may be preparing to invade Ukraine, instead accusing NATO of provocations. ""There is a threat today that there will be war tomorrow,"" Zelenskiy told a a marathon press conference with Ukrainian and international media. ""We are entirely prepared for an escalation."" Zelensky also called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to deny he was planning to invade Ukraine. ""The president of Russia should say in public: 'We are not planning this',"" he said. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg repeated Western concerns about the build-up on Friday and warned that ""if Russia uses force against Ukraine, that will have costs, that will have consequences."" Kiev has been at war with pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine for nearly eight years in a conflict that has taken over 13,000 lives. Ukraine and its Western allies accuse Russia of funding and arming the rebels, claims Moscow denies. Zelenskiy did not give details of the coup plot or accuse the Russian state of involvement, although he did say it involved Russian citizens. “I received information that a coup d'etat will take place in our country on Dec. 1-2,” he said. Zelenskiy said the Ukrainian security services obtained audio recordings in which the alleged plotters — named only as “representatives” of Ukraine and Russia — discuss their plans, mentioning billionaire Rinat Akhmetov’s possible involvement. He clarified that he believes Akhmetov, an energy tycoon whose media holdings have ramped up criticism of Zelenskiy in recent weeks, is not involved in the coup plot himself. “Let’s just say [the plotters] are discussing with Russia Rinat Akhmetov’s participation in the coup d’état in Ukraine, which will attract $1 billion,” he said. The Kremlin denied any involvement. “We don’t engage in that,” Interfax quoted Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov as telling reporters. Zelenskiy’s “de-oligarchization” campaign to reduce the influence of Ukraine’s wealthiest people on the country’s politics has been met with criticism from the Ukrainian elite.

Hysteria  Over Ukraine Conflict,English,Russia,"Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Sunday slammed the United States for driving ""hysteria"" over a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine, after Western countries accused Moscow of a troop build-up near the ex-Soviet country. His comments come as Western countries this week raised alarm over Russian military activity near Ukraine and Washington said it has ""real concerns"" over what it called ""unusual"" activity. ""This hysteria is being whipped up artificially,"" Peskov said on state television. ""Those who have brought their armed forces from overseas are accusing us of unusual military activity on our own territory. That is, the United States."" Ukraine's army has been locked in a simmering conflict with pro-Russian separatists in two breakaway regions bordering Russia since 2014, after Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine. Kiev and its Western allies accuse Russia of sending troops and arms across the border to support the separatists — claims Moscow denies. Peskov's comments come after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Saturday declined to say whether U.S. intelligence believed Russian President Vladimir Putin was aiming to seize land from Ukraine. ""We don't know what President Putin's intentions are. But we do know what's happened in the past,"" Blinken said. ""We know the playbook of trying to cite some illusory provocation from Ukraine or any other country and using that as an excuse for what Russia plans to do all along."" Putin for his part said Thursday that the West is ""escalating"" the Ukraine conflict by holding drills in the Black Sea and flying bombers near its borders. After an uptick in violence at the beginning of the year, Russia massed around 100,000 troops on Ukraine's borders in the spring, raising fears of a major escalation in the conflict which has claimed over 13,000 lives. Russia later announced a pullback but both Ukraine and its ally the United States said at the time the withdrawal was limited. Deputy Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, meanwhile, said Sunday that preparations were underway for another summit between Putin and U.S. President Joe Biden, after they met in Geneva earlier this year. Despite increased contacts between the two rivals since the June summit, tensions have recently spiked. In addition to the Ukraine conflict, the United States has warned Russia over its alleged influence in the migrant crisis on the Belarus-Poland border as well a missile strike on a satellite last week. Washington and Moscow has also continued to argue over cyberattacks and the staffing of their embassies, after several waves of diplomat expulsions.",1,415,95.29,64.27,74.14,1.55,23.06,30.6,79.76,55.66,43.86,7.47,2.65,0,1.2,0,0.48,0.72,4.82,14.22,7.95,1.2,17.59,5.06,1.2,6.02,0.24,11.57,4.58,3.13,7.47,2.41,0.72,4.34,6.99,0.24,6.75,1.45,1.45,0.24,0.96,0.24,2.65,0,5.06,0.96,4.1,0.48,0,0.48,0.24,0.24,0,0,12.29,6.75,0.72,0,2.17,0.96,2.65,5.78,0,0.24,0,0.72,8.19,6.51,1.2,0.48,1.45,0.24,0,1.2,0,0,0.72,0.24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.48,0.48,3.13,13.73,0.96,2.17,10.6,0.24,0,0.24,5.54,4.58,3.37,0.48,0,0,0,0,0,15.66,5.78,3.61,0,0,1.45,4.82

The comments come after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russia has gathered nearly 100,000 troops near its border and that Western countries had shared information about active Russian troop movements with Kiev. “We’re not recording any neighboring country’s equipment or military movement directly near the border,” Ukrainian state border service spokesman Andriy Demchenko said. “If any actions are taking place, they may be tens or even hundreds of kilometers from the state border,” the Russian state-run TASS news agency quoted Demchenko as saying on Ukraine's 24 Kanal channel. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said the U.S.-led alliance spotted “large and unusual concentrations of Russian forces” at Ukraine’s border in recent weeks. Western officials also accuse Moscow of using the escalating migrant crisis on the Polish-Belarus border to “distract” from its activities near Ukraine. The Kremlin has dismissed the concerns as unfounded, instead complaining about increased NATO activity in the region. Ukraine remains locked in a festering conflict with pro-Russia separatists in the east of the country that started seven years ago. French President Emmanuel Macron expressed “willingness to defend the territorial integrity of Ukraine” to Russian President Vladimir Putin in a telephone conversation Monday. Putin responded by saying that negotiations were ""made difficult"" by the Ukrainian authorities, the Elysee said. It added that this line of reasoning was ""often"" used by the Russian leader. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week it would be a ""serious mistake for Russia to engage in a repeat of what it did in 2014,” when it seized Crimea from Kiev.

Just last month, he spent several hours discussing world affairs at the annual Valdai Club meeting; more recently, he gave a wide-ranging interview to Russian TV, in which he discussed Ukraine, Belarus, NATO, and the United States. His appearance on Nov. 18 at a gathering of Russian Foreign Ministry senior officials resulted in a public speech and more private discussions, which of course remain confidential. The speech was fairly short, but made several important new points. The most interesting and intriguing passage concerned Russia’s adversaries: the United States, its NATO allies, and clients such as Ukraine. “Our recent warnings have had a certain effect: tensions have arisen there anyway,” Putin told the assembled officials. “It is important for them to remain in this state for as long as possible, so that it does not occur to them to stage some kind of conflict… we do not need a new conflict,” the Russian president added. Putin did not mean diplomatic warnings. Diplomacy is de facto paralyzed in Russia’s relations with Ukraine, NATO, the European Union’s leading powers such as Germany and France, and with the United States as far as Ukraine is concerned. The Kremlin has at this point completely written off Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as a negotiating partner. In exasperation with the Europeans de facto siding with Kiev against Moscow on the implementation of the Minsk Agreements, the Foreign Ministry published diplomatic correspondence between its head Sergey Lavrov and his counterparts in Paris and Berlin; according to Sergei Ryabkov, Lavrov’s deputy, recent exchanges on Ukraine with visiting U.S. Under Secretary of State Victoria Nuland produced zero results and zero understanding in Washington of Moscow’s arguments. The Kremlin also responded to NATO’s expulsion of Russian officers attached to Moscow’s mission to Brussels by severing all ties with the alliance. Instead, the warnings the Russian president was likely referring to are the activities of the Russian military. At the beginning of the year, the Russian Defense Ministry held a major exercise that included a concentration of significant forces along the entire length of the border with Ukraine: to its north, east, and south. Russian troop movements were made clearly visible, and carried the chilling message that it might not be a drill. Dmitry Kozak, the Kremlin point man on Donbass and relations with Kiev, repeated Putin’s earlier warning that a Ukrainian attempt to retake the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk regions — à la then Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili’s doomed adventure in South Ossetia in 2008 — would mean the end of the present Ukrainian state. Indeed, the exercises were taken seriously by the Americans. General Mark Milley, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, engaged in direct consultations with General Valery Gerasimov, chief of the Russian General Staff. Finally, U.S. President Joe Biden invited Vladimir Putin to a meeting in Geneva which resulted in a resumption of U.S.-Russian strategic stability talks. Yet there was no de-escalation with regard to Ukraine, the Black Sea region, and, more broadly, Eastern Europe. During the summer, a British Navy destroyer challenged Russia by sailing through territorial waters off Crimea, and Ukraine passed legislation that denied ethnic Russians the status of an indigenous community and prepared to adopt another law that, in Moscow’s view, would be tantamount to Kiev formally leaving the Minsk accords. In Donbass, the Ukrainians used a Turkish-made drone to strike pro-Russian forces; NATO significantly increased its presence and activity in the Black Sea; and U.S. strategic bombers flew missions as close as 20 kilometers from the Russian border, according to Putin. The gas price crunch in Europe provoked bitter accusations that Russia had caused it. Even the migrant crisis on Poland’s border, part of a plan by Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko to punish the EU and coerce its leaders into a dialogue with him, was blamed directly on the Kremlin. What some in Moscow had prematurely called the “spirit of Geneva” all but evaporated. Not that Russia was doing nothing to respond to and even get ahead of its adversaries. Russia allowed half a million of its newly acquired citizens in Donbass to vote in the September elections to the State Duma; made the produce of Donbass enterprises eligible for Russian government purchases; and stopped coal deliveries to Ukraine. Both President Putin and former president Dmitry Medvedev, now serving as deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, published long articles that were scathingly critical of the policies of the Ukrainian authorities and essentially concluded that there was no use talking to Kiev anymore. Against that background, reports appeared in the United States suggesting that Russia was again massing its forces on the border, and possibly preparing to invade Ukraine sooner rather than later. Right now, fears of a war in Ukraine are widespread. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has warned the Kremlin not to try to repeat what it did in 2014, lest it regret it. In fact, the stakes are much higher today than they were seven-plus years ago. In 2014, Putin, having received a mandate from the Russian parliament to use military force “in Ukraine,” limited its factual use to Crimea, plus, in a covert form, Donbass. Next time, as Putin’s own words suggest, the geographic scope of Russian military action, should the Russian commander-in-chief order it, is likely to be much broader. Those speculating what form it might take need not look at the ancient precedents of Afghanistan, Czechoslovakia, or Hungary. It makes more sense to look at Syria, except that a war in Ukraine may not be contained. Will President Putin make the fateful decision? Is Ukraine that “unfinished business” that he will seek to complete before the end of his reign? Or is Putin just bluffing? A few things are clear. NATO membership or not, seeing Ukraine turn into a U.S.-controlled unsinkable aircraft carrier parked on Russia’s border just a few hundred miles from Moscow — an apt comparison by my Carnegie colleagues in Washington — is no more acceptable to the Kremlin than that other unsinkable aircraft carrier, Cuba, was to the White House almost sixty years ago. Any Russian leader would seek to prevent such anchorage, using whatever means they have at their disposal. Another contingency would be massive military action by Ukrainian forces in Donbass, however unlikely that may seem in the West. What Saakashvili did in trying to retake South Ossetia by force back in 2008 never looked too clever to begin with, and yet he was not stopped by Georgia’s senior ally. In his speech to diplomats on Thursday, Putin called Western countries unreliable. In particular, he accused them of only “superficially” acknowledging Russia’s red lines and warnings — whatever he may have meant by that “superficiality.” Putin has called on Lavrov to provide Russia with “serious long-term guarantees” in the Euro-Atlantic region. That sounds puzzling. There is little that Russian diplomats can do to procure for Putin what he wants. More likely, the head of state may be exhorting his diplomats to exploit the fruits of military deterrence that Putin is busy organizing around Ukraine, in the Black Sea region, and elsewhere in Europe’s east. The Russian president is not, of course, leaving that task entirely to his subordinates. Even as he was delivering his hardline speech, his Security Council secretary was in talks with the U.S. National Security Adviser about another possible meeting between Putin and Biden. As always with deterrence, it can only work if the threat is believed to be credible, while any attempt to test whether the other side is bluffing may end in disaster.

Intel Believes Russian Invasion of Ukraine  Imminent  – Bloomberg,English,Russia,"The United States has warned European allies that Russia is readying for a possible invasion of Ukraine “on a scale far greater than seven years ago,” Bloomberg reported Monday. Russia has been accused by the West of funding and arming pro-Moscow rebels in eastern Ukraine since the outbreak of conflict there in 2014, claims Moscow denies. U.S. intelligence shared with some NATO members reportedly expresses “high confidence” that Russia could invade Ukraine from annexed Crimea, the western Russian border and Belarus as soon as next year, Bloomberg reported. “America and others are not saying a war is certain, or even that they know for sure Putin is serious about one,” Bloomberg said. It added that its sources “said it is likely [Putin] has not yet decided what to do.” Bloomberg reported that around half of the 100,000 soldiers are already in position for a rapid, large-scale push through “rough terrain and freezing conditions” over extensive territory and potentially prolonged occupation. Citing two unnamed people familiar with the intelligence-sharing, Bloomberg reported that Russia has also carried out an unannounced call-up of reservists “to secure territory in a later phase.” The Kremlin said Monday that the multiple reports of Russia’s planned invasion of Ukraine are “camouflage” for Ukraine’s “belligerent” attempts to reclaim ceded pro-Moscow eastern territories with outside help.

""Russia has an interest in everybody in Europe finally coming to their senses and stopping considering Russia the culprit of all problems,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. He added that Europe should instead ""address the primary sources of the problems that are currently suffocating Europe."" His remarks come after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday warned Russia against any ""military adventurism"" on the borders of Ukraine and EU member Poland. ""Recently there have been a lot of hysterical publications in Britain,"" Peskov said. ""Russia is not waging any hybrid wars,"" he added. Later on Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to address a Foreign Ministry meeting with ""detailed"" remarks, Peskov said. NATO and Western governments have denounced a build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, which has been fighting a war with pro-Russia separatists in its east since 2014. Russia had carried out large-scale drills near the Ukraine border and in annexed Crimea in the spring, sparking concerns of a possible invasion. Kiev, which in recent weeks downplayed the scale of Russia's presence at its borders, said Thursday it was seeking more military aid from the West. Videos circulated recently on social media have shown Russia moving troops, tanks and missiles towards the Ukrainian border. ""Russia's aggressiveness, both diplomatic and military, has increased considerably in recent weeks,"" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told a press briefing. The minister said that after his visits to Washington and Brussels ""work is underway to develop a comprehensive package for the containment of Russia."" He added that Kiev is in negotiations with the West for ""the supply of additional defense weapons for our army."" Moscow, in turn, has accused Kiev and the West of warmongering. In a call with French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday, Putin said U.S.-led exercises in the Black Sea were ""provocative"" and were ""increasing tensions"" between Moscow and NATO. According to the Elysee, Macron told Putin that France was ready to defend Ukraine's territorial integrity. Some Western governments have also accused Moscow of helping orchestrate the migrant crisis on the Belarus-Poland border. Several thousand migrants — mostly from the Middle East — have been staying in makeshift camps on the border in hopes of entering the EU. Brussels has accused Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko of luring the migrants to the border as revenge for sanctions against his regime over last year's crackdown on protests. Lukashenko and the Kremlin have rejected the accusations and criticized the EU for not taking in the migrants. The Belarusian strongman has twice spoken by telephone this week with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in his first direct contacts with a Western leader since last year's disputed presidential election.

Addressing an investor conference via video link, Putin declined to say whether Moscow planned to move troops across Ukraine's border — as the West has been alleging for weeks. ""Look, they spoke about a possible Russian military intervention in Ukraine at the beginning of the year. But as you see this did not happen,"" Putin said. ""It is not about intervening or not intervening, fighting or not fighting. It's about mending ties,"" Putin said, adding that it was important to take into account the security interests of all parties. ""If we sincerely strive to achieve this then no one will feel threatened."" Putin addressed investors as tensions spiral between Moscow and Brussels, and NATO looks to counter a fresh Russian military buildup on Ukraine's border. The new buildup follows a similar surge in the spring, when Russia gathered around 100,000 troops on Ukraine's borders but later announced a drawdown. Putin said Moscow was concerned by Western moves to conduct large-scale previously unannounced military drills near Russia's borders, singling out U.S.-led exercises in the Black Sea. Separately, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov lobbed a series of new accusations against Kiev and said Russia reserved the right to respond if its security was threatened. ""We simply don't have the right to exclude that the Kiev regime may embark on a military adventure. This all creates a direct threat to Russia's security,"" Lavrov told reporters, speaking alongside his Brazilian counterpart Carlos Franca. ""If the West is unable to contain Ukraine, but, on the contrary, will incite it, then of course, we will take all the necessary steps to ensure our reliable security."" Last week Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that Russia was sending ""very dangerous"" signals with troop movements on the border, warning that his military was ready to push back any offensive.

His comments come as the U.S. accuses Moscow of a troop build-up near Ukraine. Western countries have for days raised alarm over Russian military activity near Ukraine, with Washington warning Moscow against making another ""serious mistake"" in the ex-Soviet country. ""(Our) Western partners are escalating the situation by supplying Kiev with lethal modern weapons and conducting provocative maneuvers in the Black Sea,"" Putin said in a speech to the Foreign Ministry. He claimed that Western bombers are flying ""20 kilometers from our border."" The longtime Russian leader said Moscow has been ""constantly raising concerns about this"" but ""all our warnings and talk about red lines are treated superficially."" Putin has been voicing concern about U.S. naval exercises in the Black Sea for days, telling his French counterpart this week that they were ""provocative"" and leading to ""increasing tensions"" between Moscow and NATO. He has also slammed Ukraine for using a Turkish-made drone against pro-Moscow rebels. The Black Sea is a sensitive region for Russia, which controls the Crimea peninsula after annexing it from Ukraine in 2014. Since then, Kiev has fought a conflict with pro-Russia rebels in the east of the country which has claimed more than 13,000 lives. Renewed Western speculation about Russia's plans in eastern Ukraine have come amid a clash over an unexpected migrant crisis on the border with Kremlin-aligned Belarus and EU member Poland. The EU has accused the Kremlin-backed regime of Alexander Lukashenko in Belarus of purposefully luring thousands of migrants — mostly from the Middle-East — to its doorstep as revenge for sanctions. Some in the EU, including Poland, have said that Moscow is also behind the crisis. ""Brussels needs to understand that the decreasing of military-political tensions is not only in Russian interests, but in those of the whole of Europe, and even the world,"" Putin said.

But those of the past two weeks are unprecedented. For the first time, all three Eastern Slavic states — Belarus, Russia and Ukraine — are simultaneously involved. And the range of issues in play — military power, energy trade and migrant flows — is wider than ever. The region has become complex, unpredictable and increasingly dangerous. Two factors drive this. First, despite his suppression of last year’s nationwide demonstrations, Alexander Lukashenko knows that Belarus is not stable. Infuriated and threatened by the West’s sanctions and refusal to recognise him as president, he is seeking to intimidate rather than, as after previous crackdowns, restore relations with the West. The artificial migrant crisis, and empty threat to cut gas transit, reveal the futile desperation of an insecure despot whose judgement is deserting him. The Belarusian regime, long a dictatorship, is becoming a pariah. The second source of instability is Russia’s growing dissatisfaction with the status quo in Ukraine. Russia does not want to “freeze” the conflict it has fueled, but force further change. But while Russia remains publicly committed to the Minsk agreements — which according to its interpretation would federalize Ukraine and deepen Russian influence — it has no peaceful way to achieve this. Russia’s extraordinary decision, in breach of protocol, to publish recent correspondence with France and Germany suggests it is losing interest in diplomacy. Nor will its military buildup on Ukraine’s border by itself change minds in Berlin, Paris or Washington, let alone in Kiev. Russia’s only option is therefore a new military escalation. This would incur significant casualties and severe economic and financial sanctions. Yet Western leaders cannot assume that Putin weighs the risks as they might do in his shoes. His recent 5,000-word essay “On the historical unity of Russians and Ukrainians” points to ambitions that extend well beyond the matters addressed in the Minsk Agreements. Lukashenko’s struggle for survival and Putin’s designs on Ukraine are not only destabilising but connected. Despite their difficult relationship, Putin has a compelling interest in supporting Lukashenko: A free Belarus would not only seek better relations with the EU and Ukraine, but present the threat of a democratic example to Russia, as Ukraine’s revolutions in 2004 and 2014 did. Joint paratrooper exercises near the Polish border, Russia’s symbolic support with nuclear bomber overflights and the precedent of Russia’s own fabricated migrant crisis against Norway and Finland in 2015-16 all point to links between Russian and Belarusian policies.  Russia will also study reactions to Belarus’s actions to gauge Western resolve. Recent events have already produced significant effects. First, they show that Belarus and Russia can seize the initiative, threaten the status quo and precipitate crises that quickly become militarized. Second, they pose fresh tests for sanctions, a key Western policy tool. New EU measures seek to close down the complex supply chain of travel agencies, visa services and flights that enables Belarus to turn migrant misery into a novel form of de facto aggression against its neighbours. The West also seeks to use the prospect of severe future sanctions against Russia to avert a new invasion of Ukraine. Third, they mark the latest phase in a concerted Russian campaign of pressure against Europe that began soon after the Biden administration took office. In February, Russia threatened to cut off relations with the EU and humiliated High Representative Josep Borrell during his visit to Moscow. In April it conducted a massive troop buildup on Ukraine’s border. Last month it refused to supply extra gas to alleviate a temporary shortage, while suggesting that final approval of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline would resolve this. Russia could have reassured Europe of its reliability as a supplier by offering additional volumes — a smart move that might have eased Nord Stream 2 approval. Putin instead chose pressure over reassurance. He has since told the Foreign Ministry that Russia’s recent actions have produced a “certain tension” that “should be maintained as long as possible.” There is little sign that Russia seeks the “stable and predictable” relationship that America hopes for, and still less that Belarus will cease causing trouble for Europe.  On the contrary, a volatile mix of revanchism, insecurity, irrationality and military force is fueling tension and turbulence in the region.

Slaps Sanctions on Another Nord Stream 2 Firm,English,Russia,"The United States on Monday slapped sanctions on another company involved in the controversial Russia-Germany Nord Stream 2 pipeline even as it stops short of more drastic steps. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the United States was imposing sanctions on Transadria Ltd., a shipping company linked to Russia, as well as two vessels. President Joe Biden's administration took the action as part of a required report to Congress on action against the pipeline, which Ukraine and other Eastern European states fear will embolden Moscow and reduce their leverage. But Biden has waived sanctions on the main company behind Nord Stream, concluding that the pipeline will go ahead anyway and that it is better to work with Germany. ""Even as the administration continues to oppose the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, including via our sanctions, we continue to work with Germany and other allies and partners to reduce the risks posed by the pipeline,"" Blinken said in a statement. Germany, in a deal with the Biden administration, agreed to economic support to Ukraine on transitioning to clean energy and said it would insist that Russia keep gas flowing through its neighbor. The administration's approach has found wide opposition in the US Congress, with one Republican senator citing the issue to hold up State Department nominations.

Politicians in Europe have accused Moscow of withholding gas supplies in an attempt to accelerate approval for the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which links Russian gas fields to Germany via a mega pipeline under the Baltic Sea. Moscow says it is not manipulating the market and has pushed Europe to strike long-term supply deals with Gazprom if it wants to guarantee extra supplies. The company, Russia’s monopoly gas exporter, booked no additional transit capacity on either of the main transit routes to Europe through Belarus and Ukraine for the month of December, Russia’s state-run TASS news agency reported, citing data from European gas infrastructure operators. It was the third consecutive month of Gazprom booking no additional capacity on the routes, meaning the company could be intending to ship only the minimum amount of contracted supplies to the continent. Gazprom says its decisions over whether to book extra capacity are dictated by purchase agreements from gas buyers. Flows through Ukraine and Belarus have traditionally accounted for more than three-quarters of Gazprom’s supplies to the EU. However the company favors the Nord Stream pipeline, which does not incur high transit fees. The original Nord Stream, which started pumping gas in 2011, has accounted for 30% of Gazprom’s exports this year, according to Sova Capital, and is the only major transit route which has seen supply levels stable at maximum capacity throughout the year. European gas prices rose 10% in response to Gazpom not booking extra capacity through Ukraine and Belarus for December, with spot prices for gas still running at more than five times last year’s level. According to its own data, Gazprom has started to increase supplies to Europe in recent days, following a months-long process of replenishing storage facilities in Russia. Supplies to Europe were up 14% in the second week of November compared to the first week of the month. “​​We are starting to see the promised increase in flows to Europe, as well as some positive momentum in European underground storage. However, exports to Europe still lag in terms of flows versus historic levels,” said Sova Capital energy analyst Mitch Jennings. Gazprom’s gas exports to Europe are down by around 9% this year compared to the record supply year of 2018. But that comes against surging demand for power and after exports set all-time highs at the start of 2021, thus exacerbating the supply crunch which has hit markets this fall. Gazprom’s refusal to book additional transit capacity for December will keep the issue of Russia’s energy relations with Europe under the spotlight. It also comes at a time when Gazprom’s gas sales to China are surging. Shipments through the Power of Siberia pipeline, which connects Siberian gas fields to China’s energy network, are running 30% above contracted levels, the company said Monday. German regulators are currently assessing the recently completed Nord Stream 2 pipeline before it can be put into use. Officials said Monday they would consult Ukraine, which says it stands to lose $2 billion a year in transit fees from the pipeline, during that process. Russia says it is ready to start pumping gas as soon as it is given permission, and is eyeing a launch in early 2022.",1,566,97.41,18.67,60.68,18.15,25.73,30.04,74.2,54.77,41.87,4.24,0.35,0,0.18,0,0,0.18,3.89,10.42,7.07,3.18,18.9,4.95,2.47,4.24,0.88,10.95,4.42,6.36,3.53,0.18,0.35,3,7.42,0.71,6.36,0.53,0.88,0.71,0.18,0.35,3.89,0,1.59,0.71,0.88,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.42,3.18,0.18,0,0.53,0.18,1.94,0.35,0,0,0,0,1.24,0.35,0.88,0,6.18,0,0,4.24,2.3,0,0.53,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.18,0.35,0,0.88,0,0.18,0.18,0,3,9.89,0,2.65,7.07,0.53,0,0.18,6.18,2.47,5.65,0.88,0,0,0,0,0,12.37,3.89,4.42,0,0,1.77,2.3

Despite the sinister yet perplexing warnings coming from Washington and the certainties being paraded on every side by the pundits and the opinionated, we don’t know — and probably the Kremlin doesn’t know yet, either. As well as making open statements of concern and reaching out through multiple channels to Moscow, the U.S. administration has been reportedly briefing European allies about a massive reinforcement of Russian troops around Ukraine’s borders. The scenario is of 100 battalion tactical groups (BTGs) — the combined-arms mechanized units Russian army brigades generate to project force into conflict zones — or perhaps 90,000 troops, sweeping into Ukraine along multiple axes from Russia, Belarus and Crimea, in a massive strike supported by devastating airpower and long-range strikes. This would certainly be a major incursion and the implication is that it would have the objective of seizing large areas of territory or otherwise delivering a crippling blow to Ukrainian sovereignty. After all, Russia has almost 170 BTGs in permanent readiness overall, so this would represent almost two-thirds of its entire contingent. Yet buried amidst the assessment of a planned January or February assault is a crucial variable. As Bloomberg reported: The U.S. has shared intelligence including maps with European allies that shows a buildup of Russian troops and artillery to prepare for a rapid, large-scale push into Ukraine from multiple locations if President Vladimir Putin decided to invade, according to people familiar with the conversations. Quite. ‘If.’ The problem is that it is much easier to quantify capability than intent. Although there have been suggestions that this current troop build-up is being carried out more secretively than in spring, that really just means that the Russians are not making a media spectacle of it. That deployment — however much some prophesied an imminent invasion then, too — was much more clearly a political gesture. However, Moscow is well aware that the movement of thousands of troops and their associated armored vehicles, encampments and fuel bowsers can hardly be kept secret in an age of satellite surveillance and electronic eavesdropping. Forces are on the move, but so far nothing to explain the pitch of the American language (which implies they are working from some secret intelligence). Even according to Ukrainian military intelligence (GUR), there are only 40 BTGs currently around its borders, up from October’s tally, but lower than September’s (51), let alone April’s (53). That’s fewer than 40,000 soldiers — a BTG typically has a complement of 700-900 — although GUR chief Kyrylo Budanov claimed the total figure was actually 92,000. Even so, that is hardly the kind of superiority needed to take on a Ukrainian army that is now seasoned and well-trained and a quarter of a million strong, most of whom are in the Ground Forces. They may lack the higher-end capabilities of the Russians, but they would also be defending their homeland, and would be supplemented by volunteers and militias. It certainly isn’t the kind of force which could guarantee a quick and easy victory, and any attempt directly to take cities against collective local resistance — something the Russian army has never done in Ukraine — would be especially bloody. There is no way that the High Command cannot know that there would be many soldiers coming home crippled, wounded, or as ‘Cargo 200s’ — the dead. Nonetheless, if need be, the Russians could certainly build up a commanding force around Ukraine, and if Putin is willing to brave the international sanctions and condemnation and domestic outrage such a bloody war would generate, then an invasion can go ahead. But would it? Everyone knows what the Kremlin plans… With no way of knowing for sure what the Kremlin intends, observers tend to default to their operating assumptions. For those convinced Putin is an implacable foe of Ukrainian statehood, of course he is willing to pay any price to crush his foes. For those who see the most serious threat coming from Western warmongering, the U.S. position is simply making war more likely. One can frame an argument that says that Putin, eager to avoid further delegitimising his regime before the 2024 elections, would avoid such a war. One can frame one that says a war is how he would try to re-legitimate it. Focus on military balances of power and one can argue that, if Putin really does fear Ukraine’s westward drift and, especially, the danger that NATO forces would begin to be emplaced in the country – as he mused during his recent Valdai appearance, “what if missiles are stationed near Kharkov some day” under the guise of training bases? – then he may feel that delay will only make an eventual strike harder. Better to move sooner than later. Then again, maybe this is all another piece of political theatre to try and force Kiev to negotiate with Moscow on its terms, as Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council Secretary Oleksiy Danilov put it ‘to raise the table stakes of future talks.’ …Except the Kremlin The bottom line is that we do not know, and probably nor does the Kremlin. We are back to the usual metaphor of the opportunistic judoka versus the methodical chess grandmaster. This Russian administration does not tend to work on rigid, long term plans of the sort intended to bring about checkmate in 15 moves. Instead, it generates dynamic situations — which often means disrupting the status quo — and creates options for itself, so that it can seize opportunities and respond to threats as they arise. When the Russians built up their troops in spring, it was in part a rebuke and a warning to Kiev, and also a chance to see what concessions they might be able to extort. It’s highly unlikely they specifically had a summit meeting with President Biden in mind, but when that arose, they were happy to take the deal and stand down. Likewise, Putin probably has no clear and definite plan for 2022. It may be that there will be a war, although a full-scale invasion still seems an unlikely and dangerous move for a man who tends actually to be risk-averse. Alternatively, there may be some new talks — Minsk III? — or some quiet concessions. Or nothing may happen at all. The virtue of this kind of ambiguous menace is that it allows the Kremlin this option without having to look as if it is climbing down. Of course, if this happens then those crying ‘war!’ today can claim that it was only their vigilance and vehemence that made Moscow blink, just as the lack of an invasion in spring was presented as evidence of the power of the threat of sanctions, with equally little evidence. That will, however, be a small price to pay for avoiding another potential, bloody escalation.",1,1125,67.24,27,32.09,10.53,23.94,26.13,86.67,66.31,54.04,8.36,2.22,0,0.27,0,0.62,1.07,6.13,15.56,8.09,1.69,14.22,9.07,6.22,8.09,1.24,14.84,7.47,4,8.18,1.24,1.6,5.51,18.31,1.16,16.8,2.13,2.04,2.76,4.44,1.33,5.16,0,4.27,1.6,2.58,0.62,0.09,0.44,0.09,0.27,0.09,0.27,8,4,0.36,0,0.98,0.36,1.33,4,0,0,0,0.71,3.47,1.78,1.6,0.09,2.13,0.18,0.18,1.33,0.36,0.09,0.27,0.18,0.09,0.09,0,0,0,0,0.09,0.44,0,0.36,0.18,0,0,0.27,1.16,0.18,3.02,8.8,0.53,1.96,6.04,0.62,0.09,0.18,3.64,1.6,5.69,1.87,0,0,0,0,0,14.22,4.44,5.42,0.36,0.09,1.33,2.58

Moldova and Gazprom extended a deal to supply gas to the ex-Soviet country at the end of last month.  The deal was reached after a bitter stand-off that saw Chisinau declare a state of emergency over gas shortages and sign a gas contract with a country other than Russia for the first time.  On October 29, both sides said they agreed to extend their previous agreement by five years, with deliveries starting on November 1.  Kupryanov said Gazprom had signed a contract ""practically on the terms of the Moldovan side"", but on one condition: ""that Moldova completes one percent of its payments on time.""  He added that Gazprom was ""extremely disappointed with Moldova's failure to fulfil its contractual obligations.""  The agreement was reached after talks in Saint Petersburg between Moldova's Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Spinu and the Russian state-controlled firm's chief executive Alexei Miller.

Talk of a possible military confrontation between Russia and Ukraine has escalated in recent days, with Bloomberg reporting that U.S. intelligence has warned European allies a Russian invasion “on a scale far greater than seven years ago” could be “imminent.” The RTS Index — Russia’s main stock market, denominated in U.S. dollars — was down 4% by Monday afternoon, wiping billions off the valuations of Russia’s top companies. Banks were among the biggest fallers — seen as vulnerable to a devaluation in the ruble or introduction of new sanctions against Russia’s financial markets — along with energy giant Gazprom. The Russian ruble lost 1.1% against the U.S. dollar, trading at 74.4 — its lowest since August. The currency was down by a similar amount against the euro. Traders are also mulling the potential for a new round of sanctions against Russia. Over the weekend, the chair of the powerful U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee proposed a legislative amendment that could see strict new financial sanctions levied against Moscow. The declines wiped out three months of gains that had seen Russian stocks trading at all-time highs.

The Polish oil system is fully secured and operates continuously,” it added. Last week, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko threatened to cut off the transit of natural gas to Europe in response to any new sanctions over the migrant crisis. Belarus’ Gomeltransneft Druzhba restricted supplies the day after Germany’s energy regulator suspended the certification for Russia’s Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline. Later Wednesday, Belarus' Energy Ministry said it was terminating electricity supplies to neighboring Ukraine starting Thursday. The West accuses Lukashenko of luring migrants to Belarus to send them across the EU border in revenge for sanctions imposed last year after a heavy crackdown on the opposition.

Democracy Summit Snub,English,Russia,"The Kremlin said Wednesday it opposes U.S. President Joe Biden’s “divisive” democracy summit after Russia did not appear on the list of invitees. Around 110 countries have been invited to the virtual summit, including the United States' major Western allies, and snubbing Russia and China. The long-advertised meeting will take place online on Dec. 9 and 10 ahead of an in-person meeting at its second gathering next year. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the guest list, released Tuesday on the State Department website, showed that Washington ""prefers to create new dividing lines, to divide countries into those that — in their opinion — are good, and those that are bad."" ""More and more countries prefer to decide themselves how to live,"" Peskov told reporters, adding that Washington is ""trying to privatize the term 'democracy'."" The list of invitees from the former Soviet world includes Ukraine, Moldova, Armenia and Georgia as well as the three Baltic states that are now members of the European Union and NATO. Biden, who has made the struggle between democracies and ""autocratic governments"" a focal point of his foreign policy, pledged to hold the global conference during the 2020 presidential campaign. Russia’s snub comes amid tensions on multiple fronts between the two nuclear powers, with Washington blaming Moscow for a wave of cyberattacks, diplomat expulsions and election meddling. Moscow in turn labeled the U.S. an “unfriendly country” this spring, a move which Washington says forced it to halt all consular services within Russia.

Warns Russia Wagner Group Against Mali Meddling,English,Russia,"U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Saturday warned the shadowy Russian mercenary group Wagner over involvement in Mali as he pressed for a civilian transition in the troubled country. On a visit to Senegal, Blinken said that the United States was ""contributing to efforts with Mali and partners in support of stability"" in the war-ravaged country. ""I would only add that I think it would be especially unfortunate if outside actors engage in making things even more difficult and more complicated, and I'm thinking in particular of the Wagner group,"" he said. The private military outfit, which Western capitals see as closely linked to the Kremlin, has been tied to conflicts in Ukraine, Africa and the Middle East. France has been spearheading moves to target Wagner after its reported deal with Mali's military junta to send 1,000 contractors to help in a longstanding conflict with jihadists. West African regional group ECOWAS earlier this month slapped sanctions on individual members of the military junta ruling Mali since the August 2020 seizure of power. Blinken said that he agreed with Senegalese leaders on holding Mali to its pledge to transition to democracy and promised that the United States would offer benefits for such a move.

In the letter, dated April 20, 1787, and addressed to a count, the German-born ruler who expanded Russia's territory provides detailed instructions to authorities in present-day Ukraine on how to organize an effective inoculation campaign. Auction house MacDougall's, which specializes in Russian art, put the letter and a portrait of Catherine on public display in Moscow on Friday before the pieces go on sale in London. The document and portrait are estimated to have a joint worth of up to $1.6 million. Held until now in an anonymous private collection, they will be shown at a Moscow gallery until Nov. 30 and will go up for auction in London on Dec. 1. ""One of the most important (tasks) should be the introduction of inoculation against smallpox, which, as we know, causes great harm, especially among ordinary people,"" Catherine wrote to Count Pyotr Rumyantsev, reportedly on a trip to Crimea. ""Such inoculation should be common everywhere,"" she wrote in neat Cyrillic, signing ""Catherine"" in large script. She goes on to provide details on how to make vaccinations widely available, including by setting up temporary accommodation in monasteries for those who fall ill after being jabbed. The Empress was the first person in Russia to be vaccinated against smallpox. ""In today's conditions, we should be very proud of Catherine,"" the auction house's co-director and Russian art expert Yekaterina MacDougall told reporters during a press viewing on Thursday. While President Vladimir Putin says he was vaccinated with Russia's home-grown Sputnik V vaccine, he took months into the pandemic to do so – and some have criticized him for not doing so on camera. The Empress had organized an ""unreal"" propaganda campaign to encourage her subjects to be jabbed against smallpox, which was decimating populations across Europe at the time. But, ""as a very intelligent woman,"" MacDougall said Catherine stopped short of mandating vaccinations. ""She knew that the Russian people would rebel against this."" During the Covid-19 pandemic, many Russians have also rebelled against Kremlin instructions, refusing to vaccinate themselves against the virus. Despite repeated pleas from Putin, only 40% of Russians are fully vaccinated. Catherine's letter is ""unique, especially given this situation we are all in,"" historian Oleg Khromov told reporters via video link, adding that it was a ""miracle"" that it had survived. Catherine, scared of dying of smallpox like many around her, had a doctor come from England to give her the smallpox vaccine. Khromov said doctors used a sample from a child to inject Catherine with the disease. The youngster was later rewarded with a title. She was then sick for some time and when she recovered, imperial authorities put out a decree saying the Empress was feeling well and urged others to follow her. But Khromov said that despite her efforts to convince Russians to get vaccinated, ""people were scared, it was new and unusual."" When France's Louis XV died of smallpox in 1774, Catherine reportedly said it was ""barbarism"" to die of the disease in the enlightened 18th century. ""I very much hope that one day, maybe in the near future, we can say: 'What barbarism to die of Covid in the 21st century',"" Yekaterina MacDougall said.

Adds Russia to Religious Freedom Blacklist,English,Russia,"The United States on Monday added Russia to a blacklist of countries singled out for ""egregious violations of religious freedom,"" a move that comes as ties dip to their lowest ebb since the Cold War. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he was designating Russia, as well as China and eight other states, as countries of concern ""for having engaged in or tolerated 'systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom.'"" Nigeria, which was on the list last year and where Blinken is due to visit this week, was removed. The other countries still on the U.S. list for ""religious freedom violations"" are Myanmar, Eritrea, Iran, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. Algeria, Comoros, Cuba and Nicaragua were placed on a watch list. ""The United States will not waiver in its commitment to advocate for freedom of religion or belief for all and in every country,"" Blinken said in a statement. ""In far too many places around the world, we continue to see governments harass, arrest, threaten, jail, and kill individuals simply for seeking to live their lives in accordance with their beliefs."" The latest annual report by U.S. diplomats on religious freedom highlighted the Russian government's ""misuse of the law on extremism to restrict the peaceful activities of religious minorities."" ""Religious groups and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) reported authorities continued to investigate, detain, imprison, torture, and/or physically abuse persons or seize their property because of their religious faith,"" it said. Among those classified by Russia as extremist and banned are the Christian group Jehovah's Witnesses and the Muslim group Hizb ut-Tahrir. Tensions between the United States and Russia have increased recently despite upbeat declarations made by leaders Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin at a June summit in Geneva. Washington has recently warned Moscow over military activities near Ukraine and over its alleged influence in the Belarus-Poland border crisis — as well as Russia's ""dangerous and irresponsible"" strike on a satellite. President Biden also sharply criticized Putin's absence from the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow.

The ruble sank 2% against major currencies by Friday lunchtime in Moscow trading, hitting a seven-month low of 75.7 against the U.S. dollar and 85.2 against the euro.  The sell-off caps a punishing week for Russian markets, which started with what traders have dubbed “black Monday” — a day of heavy losses prompted by fears of military confrontation between Russia and Ukraine.  Russia’s stock market has now lost 16% over the past four weeks.  Several countries have restricted travel to South Africa and a number of other African countries, where the new strain of the coronavirus, named “Nu,” was first discovered.  Scientists say the new variant has more mutations on the virus’ protein spike than even the highly-transmissible Delta variant, prompting fears it could be better able to evade vaccines and extend the pandemic.  Russia’s main stock market, the dollar-denominated RTS index, slumped by more than 4% in the first hours of trading Friday as investors took stock of the news and potential impact on the global economy. Russia followed other major markets lower, with the main stock indices in London and Frankfurt also down by more than 3%. Traders in the U.S. are also braced for big losses when markets open later Friday.  In Russia, commodities companies were the biggest fallers, heading lower after a 5% fall in the price of oil, as traders fear travel restrictions and new lockdowns could be on the way.  South Africa is on Russia’s list of countries with which air travel has been restored following a complete closure of Russia’s borders at the start of the coronavirus pandemic last year. The Russian Embassy in South Africa said Friday it was following the situation, but was not advising Russians to stop travelling to the country, the state-run TASS news agency reported. The Kremlin has previously shut down travel to virus hot spots and areas where new variants have been discovered, banning flights to Britain following the discovery of the Alpha strain last December, for instance.

The pipeline, which was completed earlier this year after months of delays and setbacks amid U.S. sanctions designed to thwart it, needs approval from German authorities before it can be put into use. The German regulator said it could not proceed with certification of the pipeline because Nord Stream 2 AG, the Gazprom-controlled company which owns the pipeline, is registered in Switzerland, not Germany. “Following a thorough examination of the documentation, the Bundesnetzagentur concluded that it would only be possible to certify an operator of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline if that operator was organised in a legal form under German law,” the regulator said in a statement Tuesday. Gazprom’s share price dropped 2% on the news, which comes as Europe faces a gas supply crunch, with Russia accused of withholding supplies in a bid to force approval for Nord Stream 2. Nord Stream 2 AG has agreed to set up a German subsidiary to govern the German part of the pipeline, the regulator said in its statement. “The certification procedure will remain suspended until the main assets and human resources have been transferred to the subsidiary.” Once that process is completed, the certification period will resume. Under German law, the regulator has four months to review documentation and make a decision on whether to approve the pipeline. It is the latest setback for Nord Stream 2, which has been beset with delays and hold-ups in recent years amid escalating tensions between Russia and the West. The pipeline has been heavily criticized by many European countries, including key German ally France, as well as Poland and the Baltic States, who see it as a Russian geopolitical weapon. Washington’s hostility to the project drove a wedge between the U.S. and Germany under the Donald Trump administration. New U.S. President Joe Biden struck a deal earlier this year with Germany to drop opposition to the project, with Germany pledging to support Ukraine, which stands to lose up to $2 billion a year in lucrative transit fees. The new pipeline, which connects Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea runs alongside the existing Nord Stream gas link. When launched, the two pipelines could account for 60% of Russia’s gas exports to Europe. European spot prices for gas — already elevated amid a supply crunch across the continent — jumped a further 5% on the news.",1,414,98.63,26.92,37.9,14.89,25.88,28.02,74.88,53.14,43.72,4.59,0.24,0,0,0,0,0,4.35,14.73,12.08,3.38,16.67,5.07,1.45,4.35,0.48,9.18,4.11,2.66,6.52,0.48,1.45,4.59,6.04,0,6.04,0.97,0.97,1.21,0.48,0,2.66,0,2.42,0.97,1.45,0.24,0,0.24,0,0.24,0,0,3.86,3.14,0.48,0,1.21,0.24,1.21,0.72,0,0.24,0,0,3.86,1.45,2.42,0,6.04,0,0,4.83,1.45,0,0.24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.24,0,0,0,0.48,0,0.24,0.24,0,1.45,9.18,0,1.93,6.76,0.24,0,0.48,5.31,4.59,2.9,0.48,0,0,0,0,0,13.77,5.31,4.83,0,0,1.21,2.42

Around 2,000 people, mainly from the Middle East, are estimated to be living near the Poland-Belarus border in dire conditions and desperate to cross into the European Union. The EU says Belarus engineered the crisis in retaliation for sanctions on the ex-Soviet country. Minsk and its main ally Russia have rejected the charges and criticized the EU for not taking in the migrants seeking to cross over. ""We call on the regime to cease immediately its aggressive and exploitative campaign,"" the EU and foreign ministers of the G7 global powers said. But Belarus has said it wants to de-escalate the crisis. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's spokeswoman Natalya Eismont said on Thursday that there were currently around 7,000 migrants in the country. She said Belarus will send 5,000 of the migrants home, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel will negotiate with the EU on creating ""a humanitarian corridor to Germany"" for the 2,000 on the border. There was no immediate reaction from Germany. A repatriation flight with between 200 and 300 migrants on board took off from Belarus on Thursday bound for Erbil in Iraqi Kurdistan and Baghdad. The flight traveling to Baghdad is carrying 431 people, Russia's Interfax news agency reported. In the latest border incident, the Polish defense ministry said that Belarusian forces had first carried out reconnaissance and ""most likely"" damaged the barbed wire fence along the border. ""Then the Belarusians forced the migrants to throw stones at Polish soldiers to distract them. The attempt to cross the border took place several hundred meters away,"" it said. ""Belarusian special forces led yesterday's attack,"" it said. The border guard said a total of around 500 migrants took part in the attempted crossing and 200 of them were detained after crossing into Poland successfully. It said a family of five people, including three children aged between seven and nine, had been injured in the incident and were taken to hospital. Video footage released by the defense ministry appeared to show Polish soldiers surrounding a large group of migrants crouched down in a wooded area at night next to barbed wire. The incident could not be independently verified as journalists are banned from the immediate border area on the Polish side. Lukashenko, who has cracked down on political opponents and independent media for nearly three decades, has spoken twice to Merkel about the crisis in recent days. Lukashenko's press service on Wednesday said the Belarus leader and Merkel ""agreed that the problem as a whole will be brought up to the level of Belarus and the EU."" The Polish government has warned against any agreement on the crisis that might be struck ""over our heads."" Poland's state-run TVP network also on Thursday began broadcasting a new English-language channel TVP World, bringing forward the launch to ""show the whole world the truth"" about the migrant crisis on the Poland-Belarus border. Meanwhile British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said he would stand ""shoulder to shoulder"" with Poland during a visit to a military base in northeast Poland that hosts a NATO battlegroup. A squadron of British military engineers is expected in Poland later this month to help with border fencing and repairing roads in the area, Polish Defense Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said. Aid groups say at least 11 migrants have died since the crisis began in the summer. Polish medical workers said they had assisted a Syrian couple in the early hours of Thursday who had been in the forest for one and a half months. ""Their one-year-old child died in the forest,"" the Polish Center for International Aid said on Twitter. In another incident, video footage released by Belarusian border guards showed a Lithuanian border guard dog biting a man lying on the ground in a sleeping bag. Lithuania's boder guard admitted to the incident, saying that they were attempting to push back a group of migrants into Belarus and that the border guard did not see the migrant.

It’s become unhelpful at best and dangerous at worst, both in terms of understanding what Belarus is doing and the wider issue of Russia’s role in the neighborhood and beyond. Since the summer, Belarus has been enabling migrants, mostly from the Middle East, to travel through the country, huddling them up against the Polish border, even as President Alexander Lukashenko threatened to bring a migrant crisis to his neighbour’s doorstep. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki called Vladimir Putin the mastermind of the crisis, with officials and commentators widely describing the standoff as part of Putin’s “hybrid warfare” playbook. But not only does this language hobble our ability to really do anything about this human tragedy, let alone make sense of it. The very rhetoric of war risks bringing war closer. Ultimately, we cannot know what goes on in the conversations between Putin and his client Lukashenko and our feeble attempts to ascribe intent are based on conjecture. This week, Belarus restricted oil through the Druzhba pipeline to Poland and it emerged that Lukashenko, in his phone call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, allegedly demanded recognition and an end to sanctions in exchange for ending the crisis. Are all of these things, the migrants, the threats, the oil restrictions, part of some grand, coordinated onslaught managed from Moscow, or simply a series of retaliations for sanctions by a wavering dictator with no clear plan? The move to restrict oil really put Russian pipeline monopoly Transneft on the spot. In his statement, the company’s representatives called the Belarus repairs “unscheduled,” in effect distancing itself from this decision. The Kremlin, of course, is silent. Which doesn’t mean it’s pleased. That means literally: it may not necessarily mean anything at all. To know means to presume that Lukashenko knows exactly what he’s doing, that he approved this decision with Moscow, and that there’s some kind of reasonable plan. I’m not so certain. After all, Putin has warned against Minsk threatening to cut off oil and gas supplies to Europe as a move that will risk the already shaky relations between Russia and Belarus. More to the point, Lukashenko has a history of threatening Moscow as well. Let’s assume that Lukashenko and Putin are coordinating all these actions and statements, and especially that it’s part of a larger power play against European countries that also, absurdly, includes Russian troop build up on the Ukrainian border — but to achieve what, exactly? End sanctions? That scenario presumes a Kremlin that is either incredibly stupid or exceedingly smart, and that it’s adopted a strategy of three-dimensional chess that would make anyone’s head spin, and that its relations with Lukashenko are seamless and trustworthy. But none of these things are true. In my 20 years of writing about Russian foreign policy, I have yet to witness Putin thinking more than two steps ahead. Chess is probably the worst analogy for Putin’s behavior on the world stage, let alone for Lukashenko, who has a history of angering everyone around him, including Putin, without any clear plan. Perhaps Lukashenko had something of a plan prior to August 2020, when a particularly rigged election sparked mass protests and repressions that ultimately stripped the leader of much of his legitimacy. Until then he had been playing bait and switch with Moscow, oscillating between the Russians and the West in attempts to haggle out some choice energy subsidies from Russia. If it was a strategy, it failed because Moscow itself ultimately got tired of his unreliability and cut back on the subsidies. Since then, supporting Lukashenko has been a chore for the Kremlin, but a chore it can’t seem to let up precisely because when U.S. and EU officials and commentators make irresponsible comments tying up Lukashenko and Putin in some kind of wholesale “hybrid war” against the west it only vindicates Kremlin paranoias. Alas, Mark Galeotti has been one of the few voices to make the obvious point that making Putin responsible for Lukashenko has the effect of pushing them together. But I would also argue that our very fixation on the term “hybrid war” to describe what is happening is making the problem worse, and muddling what is actually going on. Do Lukashenko’s actions theoretically constitute hybrid warfare? Possibly. Maybe. Likely. But here’s the problem. What is even a hybrid war? Simply put, it is being nasty to your neighbor or another country by using non-military means together with military ones. By definition, most wars are hybrid wars in that they involve propaganda, diplomacy or politics. But the non-kinetic, non-conventional components of a hybrid war — disinformation, lawfare, political shenanigans, even political destabilization campaigns — also happen outside of the state which we commonly regard as war. We are in effect describing peacetime behavior as war, implicitly suggesting that kinetic aggression is the next stage in the plan. What could possibly go wrong? The recent hybrid war fad emerged when Russian military officials started talking about it as something that the United States was doing to Russia and other countries. It then deployed hybrid tactics in Ukraine to counter what it believed was a Western hybrid war. In other words, hybrid war emerged as a talking point of Russian propaganda. While it may be useful to look at what Russia did in Ukraine in 2014 through the lens of hybridity, I don’t believe that everything Russia has been doing since then constitutes some kind of wholesale hybrid war against the West. To say so, we are in effect parroting and amplifying Russian propaganda. We have become locked in a vicious and dangerous feedback loop by qualifying every selfish and nasty thing that Russia or its allies do as part of “hybrid war.” Russia is doing the same. The result is political escalation and the increasing fear, if not threat, of real war, as Leonid Ragozin wrote in bne IntelliNews. How about we all stop? As journalists, analysts, and policymakers, isn’t it our job to make sense of facts, and to avert, rather than exacerbate, crises? And not to write screenplays for future Netflix war epics? While it has its uses, the hybrid war concept has already been coming under criticism by scholars. But its damage lies outside the academe. Its (ab)use by officials and pundits who see an all-powerful Putin lurking around every corner, of a grand plan to destroy western values every time a dictator does something nasty, amounts only to epic that deflects from the difficult and often boring work needed to solve serious problems that demagogues everywhere — and yes, that also includes the Polish Prime Minister — love to politically exploit. When it comes to Russia, its role in potentially helping solve this particular crisis is more limited than many tend to assume. Putting pressure on Russia over Lukashenko will only backfire. But drawing it into talks — while offering something in return — may offer a limited benefit. Putin has offered to mediate the crisis and, to an extent, may already be doing so. It may not entirely change Lukashenko’s behavior — the Kremlin’s brokering potential is ever more modest than it sometimes makes it out to be — but it may make it more difficult for him to get away with it. But to work, either Germany, the EU, or whatever body that will be brokering this mediation will need to discard its assumptions about some kind of Russian hybrid war against the West before it approaches Moscow. Contrary to the widely popular idea that Putin can stop Lukashenko whenever he wants, the reality is that forcing someone to do something is always hard, costly work. Moscow will obviously be looking for something in return. Russia may continue to believe whatever it wants about the West waging a hybrid war against it. It doesn’t mean that the EU and the U.S. have to continue believing the same.

The EU has accused the Belarusian government of shipping Middle Eastern migrants toward Poland to force the bloc to drop sanctions imposed after the disputed victory of longtime leader Alexander Lukashenko in presidential elections. Poland, in turn, says Russia, Belarus’s only major ally and key political and economic backer, orchestrated the crisis. But despite ongoing Russian support for Lukashenko, who faced down unprecedented protests against his 27-year rule over Belarus last year, analysts from the two countries cast doubt on the idea that Russia has contrived the migration crisis, saying Moscow’s position on its neighbor is complex and often contradictory. “I don’t think Lukashenko needed any push from Russia to act in this way,” said Artyom Shraibman, a Belarusian political analyst based in Ukraine. “He has been threatening to unleash the flow of migrants for many years before 2021.” “But then, if Moscow had wanted to stop Lukashenko, it could have done so,” added Shraibman. The roots of the present crisis go back to August 2020. When Lukashenko claimed a landslide victory in his bid for a sixth term in office, the opposition cried foul and Belarus was plunged into uproar. As security forces resorted to vicious violence to put down unprecedentedly large protests, the EU — in particular Belarus’s neighbors Poland and Lithuania — threw their weight behind Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, the opposition candidate who said she defeated Lukashenko at the polls. The aftermath of the election, which saw sanctions imposed on Belarus and Lukashenko rendered persona non grata in Europe, spelled the end of Minsk’s decades-long policy of balancing relations between Russia and Europe to extract concessions from both. Instead, Russian President Vladimir Putin, seeing in Lukashenko a guarantee that Belarus would not follow Ukraine in aligning with the West, stepped in offering economic and political support that proved crucial in thwarting the Belarusian protest movement. The result, however, was to leave Lukashenko, who had always jealously guarded his country’s independence, profoundly reliant on Putin, with whom he has reportedly had difficult personal relations. Among Russian experts, there is broad agreement that the migration crisis is Lukashenko’s bid to force Europe to talk to him, and therefore to lessen his dependence on Russia. “Throughout this crisis, Lukashenko has been trying to force the West into dialogue,” said Andrei Kortunov, head of the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC), a Kremlin-aligned think tank. Russia’s contradictory moves throughout the crisis — signaling support for Lukashenko with military drills in Belarus while also coordinating with European leaders to defuse the crisis — point to the Kremlin’s complex position on Belarus, which aims to keep Lukashenko in office while preventing him from resuming his traditional independence. “Lukashenko wants to put some distance between Minsk and Moscow and to increase his freedom for maneuver independent of Russia,” said Kortunov. “It would be strange if Putin supported him in that.” For some experts, Russia’s guarded support for Lukashenko reflects the Belarusian president’s own weakness, and the improbability of his scheme bearing fruit. “Russia doesn’t need to publicly abandon Lukashenko because the chances of him actually managing to force the EU to restore relations were always very minimal,” said Maxim Samorukov, a scholar of post-Communist Eastern Europe at the Moscow Carnegie Center. For Samorukov, Lukashenko’s continued pariah status in Europe means his migration gambit was never likely to achieve his goals. “It’s quite clear that a phone call with Merkel isn’t the same as sanctions relief, or a reset in relations,” he added, referring to Lukashenko’s call with the outgoing German chancellor this week, the first since his disputed re-election. With the EU unanimous in its support for Poland’s actions despite Warsaw’s strained relations with Brussels, and Middle Eastern countries shutting down flights to Minsk under EU pressure, some conclude that Lukashenko’s bid to force his neighbours into dealing with him has failed. “Lukashenko wanted the Europeans to realize what good relations with Belarus had given them in terms of border security,” said political analyst Shraibman. “I don’t think it has worked in the way he intended.” However, regardless of Lukashenko’s isolation, some Russian experts feel that the Belarusian strongman is becoming a liability for Moscow’s interests. “The main goal of Russian policy in Belarus isn’t to annex Belarus, but to make sure Belarus doesn’t move toward the West,” said Carnegie’s Samorukov. “On the one hand, Lukashenko is an iron-cast guarantee that won’t happen. But on the other, Russia also understands that Lukashenko’s behavior is itself becoming a risk factor.” It has not gone unnoticed in Moscow that the migration standoff is Lukashenko’s second self-inflicted crisis in a year. In May, the forced grounding of a Ryanair jet flying over Belarus and the arrest of an opposition journalist onboard provoked international outrage and led to Belarus’s transport links with the outside world being almost entirely severed. In the last week, experts have pointed to Lukashenko’s threat to shut off the Yamal pipeline, which carries Russian gas through Belarus to Europe, as particularly disturbing for Moscow at a time when gas supplies to the EU are a sensitive issue. Putin, in an interview with Russian state TV, publicly rebuked Lukashenko for the pipeline threat, dismissing his Belarusian ally as “overly emotional.” According to Samorukov, Lukashenko’s increasingly erratic conduct has the Kremlin set on a gradual, stage-managed transition of power in Minsk ahead of presidential elections scheduled for 2025. “There’s no need for him to go imminently, but everyone now understands that Lukashenko shouldn’t run for another term,” said Samorukov. “That would be the single biggest risk to Russian interests in Belarus.” With Lukashenko having publicly committed himself — with Russian endorsement — to an as-yet vague program of constitutional reform to be approved by referendum, some see a mechanism by which Belarus’s first and so far only president could formally retire, even while maintaining a degree of control over his country. “Every time you hear a Russian official talk about constitutional reform in Belarus, they’re saying that Lukashenko has to go,” said Samorukov.",1,1015,94.41,43.54,23.76,10.47,26.71,34.78,77.34,55.57,43.94,6.8,3.45,0.2,0,0.1,2.46,0.3,3.35,12.91,7.59,0.99,17.14,5.12,2.76,4.43,1.18,11.92,4.63,2.76,6.7,0.59,1.58,5.22,10.54,0.79,9.66,1.77,1.58,1.28,1.28,0.59,2.96,0,5.02,1.97,2.96,0.59,0.1,0.39,0,0.2,0.1,0,10.84,5.42,1.08,0,1.48,0.3,2.36,4.83,0,0.3,0.1,2.36,6.21,3.05,2.86,0.3,2.46,0.1,0.3,1.87,0.2,0,0.39,0.1,0,0.1,0,0,0,0.1,0,1.48,0.39,0.1,0,0,0,0.3,1.77,0.3,2.46,10.54,0.39,2.17,7.59,0.49,0.1,0.2,3.25,3.65,3.45,0.89,0,0,0,0,0,18.13,3.74,6.6,0,0,3.55,4.24

It did not surprise me to find three almost empty jars of adjika, which, alas, could not be combined, as they were all different. I threw the contents of the spiciest into a plastic bag of marinating pork, smeared the other on a grilled cheese sandwich for lunch, and mixed the third together with kefir and lemon juice to make salad dressing. And as I did so, it reminded me of how versatile and enjoyable adjika can be. But what is adjika exactly? I’ve heard adjika called everything from “Georgian pesto,” to “Russian salsa,” to “Kyrgyz harissa.” Adjika is none of these things, of course, though harissa is the closest analogy. Adjika is a chili paste, tempered with garlic, salt, and a few signature Caucasian spices. Though the Georgians have eagerly claimed this beloved regional condiment as their own, adjika is originally from Abkhazia, the autonomous republic of the South Caucasus, which, come to think of it, the Georgians also claim as their own. Adjika in Abkhaz means “salt,” and the condiment’s story begins with Abkhazian shepherds, who fed salt to their grazing sheep to increase their appetites and thus fatten them up. Because salt was an expensive commodity, the shepherds mixed it with the region’s ubiquitous red peppers, later adding wild herbs and garlic to the mixture. The best adjika is hand ground with stones, though today, most people take the straightforward route and use a food processor or meat grinder. Adjika’s appeal has spread far beyond the pasturelands of Abkhazia. The spicy, salty condiment was adopted (the Abkhazians might use the word “appropriated”) by the republic’s neighbors in the region, where adjika is a popular ingredient for soups, stews, and marinades, and an essential condiment, appearing on the table to liven up everything from a dish of beans to a full lamb roasted on a spit. As adjika traveled north through the vast Russian empire, it was further adapted with ingredients that no Caucasian would ever dream of including. In Ukraine, I have encountered “adjika” made with peppers, carrots, apples, honey, and tomatoes, while Russians add copious amounts of dill to a heavily tomato-based sauce and also call that adjika. Clearly across the years and kilometers, the word “adjika” has taken on a generic meaning for a piquant sauce or condiment. It is just as impossible to pin down a definitive, authoritative recipe for adjika as it is one for Pesto Genovese, but the essential ingredients are red peppers (both bell and chili), salt, garlic, coriander, blue fenugreek, and calendula or dried marigold flowers. The hottest, spiciest adjika, used predominantly in cooking, is heavy on the chili peppers and their seeds: a pepper’s heat comes from its seeds, so you can always gage the relative spiciness of adjika by the number of seeds in it. Milder versions of adjika are served at table as dips or spreads, the fire dampened by the exclusion of the seeds and a generous addition of walnuts. Green adjika is less common, perhaps because its key ingredients — green peppers and fresh herbs — are more perishable and thus more challenging to preserve and transport. But green adjika is no less delicious with its dominant notes of garlic and fresh herbs, making it a superb marinade for lamb, fish, and poultry. This is the adjika I turn to when all about me is cold, dark, and grey and I need a reminder of the bright sun and intoxicating air of the south. As we grapple with faulty supply chains throughout the world, increasingly I am setting myself the challenge of making things from scratch, particularly essentials I used to pick up at retail outlets or buy online. And so it is now with adjika, which I always want to have on hand. There are so many things this versatile sauce/condiment can do, from livening up a bowl of cottage cheese to marinating pork. Pair it with leftover roast turkey or chicken as a marvelous zingy note or slather it on a well-grilled steak instead of garlic butter. I love to serve mild adjika as a dip on its own or swirled around a bowl of hummus or labneh. It is a marvelous addition to a charcuterie board, an omelet, tucked inside a pita sandwich, or on top of a side dish of grains. Stuff jacket potatoes with either one of the adjikas listed below, or dip small meatballs in a shallow bowl of either of these versions of Abkhazia’s incomparable condiment. However you choose to enjoy them, may they bring sunshine and warmth to you! *Note: This milder version or adjika is primarily used as a spread rather than a sauce. Its distinctly orange color comes from the calendula or dried marjoram leaves and the addition of walnuts. Ingredients Preparation Ingredients Preparation Recipe Notes *Removing the seeds from hot peppers will make the condiment less fiery. You may wish to use protective gloves for this step and be very careful of touching your face with your hands when working with spicy peppers. ** Blue fenugreek and calendula are available from online retailers.

Warns Russia of  High - Impact  Sanctions If It Invades Ukraine,English,Russia,"U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that Washington had seen ""evidence"" Russia could be planning an invasion of Ukraine, threatening Moscow with painful economic sanctions if it attacks. Blinken accused Moscow of massing ""tens of thousands of additional combat forces"" near Ukraine's border as he geared up for talks with Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Stockholm over the crisis. ""We're deeply concerned by evidence that Russia has made plans for significant aggressive moves against Ukraine, plans include efforts to destabilise Ukraine from within as well as large scale military operations,"" he said after a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Latvia's capital Riga. ""Now, we don't know whether President (Vladimir) Putin has made the decision to invade. We do know that he's putting in place the capacity to do so on short order, should he so decide,"" he said. Blinken insisted ""diplomacy is the only responsible way to resolve this potential crisis"" but warned there would be ""far-reaching and long-lasting consequences"" for Moscow if it pushed ahead with any aggression. ""We made it clear to the Kremlin that we will respond resolutely, including with a range of high-impact economic measures that we've refrained from using in the past,"" Blinken said. Kiev's Western allies have been sounding the alarm since last month over a fresh Russian troop buildup around Ukraine's borders and a possible winter invasion. Russia, which seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and backs separatists fighting Kiev, has strongly denied it is plotting an attack and blames NATO for fuelling tensions. Moscow on Wednesday hit back by accusing Ukraine of massing tens of thousands of troops in the country's east, as worries grow over an escalation. The allegations came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for direct talks with Moscow over the festering conflict with Russian-backed separatists in the east of his country. ""We must tell the truth that we will not be able to end the war without direct talks with Russia,"" Zelensky said during an annual address to lawmakers in Kiev. More than 13,000 people have been killed in a war that began in 2014 between Ukraine and pro-Russian separatists, who have carved out two ""People's Republics"" in eastern Ukraine. In Moscow, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov appeared to pour cold water on the idea, reiterating that the war was a domestic problem in Ukraine. ""We know of attempts to present Russia as a party to this conflict. This is not the case,"" Peskov told reporters. ""The war in Donbass can only be stopped through negotiations between Ukrainians and Ukrainians."" A senior U.S. official on Wednesday urged a ""complete ceasefire"" on the Donbass conflict over Christmas. ""With the Christmas season coming, this is a time for a resumption of complete ceasefire, for prisoner exchange and for re-opening of crossing points so that families can visit,"" Victoria Nuland, the U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs told a security forum in Kiev via a video link. ""We have been encouraging both Moscow and Kiev to work together on a package of those kinds of measures,"" Nuland added. Putin has warned the West and Kiev against crossing the Kremlin's ""red lines"" over staging military exercises and building up weaponry in Ukraine. Blinken insisted in Riga that NATO allies were ""making sure that Ukraine has the means to defend itself."" And he said that the alliance would ""look at what it needs to do in the event of further Russian aggression, to shore up its own defenses"" as NATO eyes bolstering forces along its eastern flank. Blinken said Russia was using the same ""playbook"" it employed when it took control of Crimea, including by intensifying ""disinformation"" to portray Kiev as the ""aggressor"".

Speaking in his annual address to the Ukrainian parliament on Wednesday, Zelenskiy said the return of Crimea to Ukraine following Moscow’s 2014 annexation of the peninsula should be the country’s main goal — but stopped short of saying it should be retaken by force. “We see this as a direct threat to Russia,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying by Interfax. “Such wording means that the regime in Kiev intends to use all available possibilities, including force, in order to encroach on a Russian region."" In addition to the conflict over the annexation of Crimea, Kiev has been locked in a nearly eight-year war with pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine that has claimed over 13,000 lives. Ukraine and its Western allies accuse Russia of sending arms and funding to the rebels, claims Mosow denies. Tensions have ratcheted up significantly between Ukraine and Russia in recent weeks, with Kiev accusing Moscow of massing forces near their shared border and the United States warning of a possible Russian invasion. Russia, in turn, has accused Ukraine of massing troops near southeastern Ukraine, and NATO of provocations. Zelenskiy on Wednesday called for direct talks with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to end the escalation. “Let’s be honest, the war in Donbass has been going on for eight years. Eight years since Russia annexed Crimea,” Zelenskiy said. “We must talk, knowing that we have a strong and powerful army.” Kiev's Western allies have warned that Russia could use a perceived threat to its security as pretext for an invasion of Ukraine. ""The likelihood of hostilities in Ukraine is still high,"" Peskov said Thursday. ""This remains a matter of particular concern and worry for us. We are seeing an increase in the intensity of provocative actions on the contact line."" Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) said Thursday it had detained three alleged Ukrainian spies who it said were gathering secrets and plotting terrorist attacks. The chief diplomats of the U.S. and Russia are due to meet in Sweden on Thursday, where they are likely to discuss the escalation in tensions with Ukraine.

Zelenskiy's call came as NATO looks to counter what it says is a build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken set to meet Russia's top diplomat Sergei Lavrov in Stockholm on Thursday. ""We must tell the truth that we will not be able to end the war without direct talks with Russia,"" Zelenskiy said during an annual address to lawmakers in Kiev. ""Let's be honest, the war in Donbass has been going on for eight years,"" Zelenskiy said, referring to eastern Ukraine. ""We must talk, knowing that we have a strong and powerful army,"" Zelenskiy added, saying he was ""not afraid"" to speak directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin. In Moscow, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov appeared to pour cold water on the idea, reiterating that the war was Ukraine's domestic issue. ""We know of attempts to present Russia as a party to this conflict. This is not the case,"" Peskov told reporters. ""The war in Donbass can only be stopped through negotiations of Ukrainians with Ukrainians."" More than 13,000 people have been killed in a war between Kiev troops and Russian-backed separatists who have carved out two ""People's Republics"" in eastern Ukraine. Kiev and its Western allies have accused Russia of stirring up the separatist conflict to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and the EU and sending troops and arms to support the breakaway regions. Moscow has denied those claims. The war broke out after a popular uprising in Kiev ousted a Kremlin-backed president and Moscow moved to annex Crimea in 2014. Even though active fighting has decreased, the West has been concerned by Russia's troop movements on Ukraine's border this year. Kiev's Western allies have since last month warned of a fresh Russian troop buildup around Ukraine's borders and a possible winter invasion. The alleged surge follows a similar buildup in the spring, when Russia gathered around 100,000 troops on Ukraine's borders but later announced a drawdown. At the peak of those tensions Zelenskiy invited the Russian leader to meet for talks in eastern Ukraine, but the Kremlin declined the invitation. Russian officials in turn have accused Kiev of massing tens of thousands of troops near separatist-controlled territory. ""The Armed Forces of Ukraine are building up their military strength, massing heavy equipment and personnel,"" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Wednesday. ""According to some reports, the number of Ukrainian troops in the conflict zone has already reached 125,000 personnel,"" she claimed, saying this represented half of Kiev's troops. Those comments followed the Ukrainian foreign ministry saying Tuesday that Russia has massed 115,000 troops around Ukraine, on the Crimean peninsula and in two eastern regions occupied by the breakaway fighters. Putin on Tuesday declined to say whether Moscow planned to move troops across Ukraine's border. ""Look, they spoke about a possible Russian military intervention in Ukraine at the beginning of the year. But as you see this did not happen,"" Putin said. The Russian leader added that the security interests of all parties should be taken into account and called for improved ties. Blinken was in Latvia on Wednesday where a meeting of NATO foreign ministers focused largely on tensions over Russia's military build-up.

According to the Levada Center, 39% of Russian respondents believe that war with Ukraine is either highly likely or unavoidable. Another 38% said that Russian-Ukrainian war is unlikely. Only 15% rule out the possibility of a Russian-Ukrainian war. Exactly half of those polled blamed the U.S. and other NATO countries for the current tensions in Ukraine. Older respondents were more likely to blame the West than their younger counterparts. The U.S. and its allies have in recent weeks said their intelligence and Russian troop movements near Ukrainian borders pointed to Moscow’s plans to invade Ukraine. Russia has denied planning an invasion, saying its military maneuvers come in response to Ukraine’s troop buildup. Moscow has also recently stepped up accusations of NATO’s eastward expansion and its deployment of weapons that threaten Moscow’s security. According to Levada, 16% of Russian respondents pinned the blame for heightened tensions on Ukraine. That figure saw little change when broken down into age groups. Only 4% blamed Russia and 3% the pro-Moscow breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine for the standoff. These figures also remained unchanged across all age groups. Younger Russians, however, were more likely to say that no one is to blame for the Russian-Ukrainian tensions or not answer the question than their older counterparts.

To encourage Biden to accept this responsibility, Russia has been staging military drills close to Ukraine’s borders, with enough troops massing there to launch an offensive. As Putin seeks a final formula for the configuration of the post-Soviet space, the signal is clear: if the Minsk agreements aren’t being implemented, the alternative is military force. Back in October, Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said that in order to help resolve the conflict, the United States doesn’t necessarily have to be part of the Normandy format for talks (that format consists of Ukraine, Russia, France, and Germany). Another way of interpreting this is that Moscow doesn’t see the need for the Europeans to take part in any serious conversation on Ukraine, since it believes that any such conversation should take place directly between Moscow and Washington. This was also the thinking behind the Russian Foreign Ministry’s controversial publication of confidential correspondence on Ukraine between the ministry’s head, Sergey Lavrov, and his French and German colleagues: Moscow is showing that there is nothing to discuss with Ukraine’s advocates, and that talks should be held directly with its patron Washington. It also explains Lavrov’s complaints that Russia proposed including the United States in the Normandy format, but that Germany and France refused, as well as Putin’s calls for firm guarantees that NATO will not expand further east: something only the United States can promise. Although this may look like an unreasonable negotiating position now, it clearly sets out the strategic horizon of Russia’s demands. If those demands are satisfied, Russia is ready to promise predictability and security. In other words, the issue here is the Minsk agreements in their broadest interpretation: a chain of actions and obligations that should lead to a Ukraine that is friendly and neutral, but not necessarily subordinate to Moscow: something along the lines of Kazakhstan. By massing its troops at Ukraine’s borders, Russia is implying that Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements is a sign it wants to take back the Donbas by force. Ukraine’s Western allies don’t believe for one minute that Kiev would embark on such a reckless undertaking, and instead see it as a sign of impending Russian aggression. The Americans don’t want a war in Europe: it could lead to the defeat of their ally Ukraine, and the need to come back swinging at Russia. The impossibility of responding by force and the insufficiency of further sanctions would make America look weak for the second time in a year, following its withdrawal from Afghanistan. In these circumstances, it’s better to work on the Minsk accords — or other agreements. Judging by the Russian communique on the presidential meeting, as well as by the press conference given by Biden’s national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, the United States is indeed prepared to push for the implementation of the Minsk agreements. Still, Biden can’t just accept responsibility for implementing the agreements simply because the Kremlin is disappointed in Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the Europeans: that would mean he was carrying out Putin’s wishes, and he has promised not to give in to him. In this respect, the buildup of troops and talk of an imminent Russian attack on Ukraine are very timely. For having confirmed to Putin the U.S. commitment to taking part in resolving the Ukraine conflict, Biden needs something in exchange — like showing the world he has managed to stop Putin and prevent a war. That’s no mean feat, and a powerful defense against those who have criticized him for even sitting down with Putin. For this reason, among others, the idea of an impending war began to take on a life of its own even before the summit, and to have as much impact on the behavior of the parties involved as actual events. The source of this talk of a coming war is Western media, politicians, and experts: not the Kremlin, which prefers to use secret special operations to achieve its goals, rather than openly mobilize its troops, which is simply a way of strengthening its negotiating position. Biden has come out of this as the leader who prevented a war, but that’s not to say that the summit will necessarily be followed by deescalation and the return of Russian troops to their barracks, as was the case back in the spring after the agreement to hold the Geneva summit. This time, no dramatic deescalation is likely. Biden will be the leader who prevented a war, but not the threat of war: not until Moscow sees new steps taken by Washington on Ukraine and visible signs of work on engaging with Russian security concerns. The Minsk agreements themselves are not equally acceptable to Ukraine and the United States. Washington has said that the agreements are the most important and, effectively, the only way of resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The United States cannot, without losing face, give public assurances that Ukraine will not join NATO. Its intentions on this issue can only be divined from indirect signs over several months, or even years. For Moscow, progress on implementing the parts of the Minsk agreements that are most unpalatable to Kiev would show that its concerns are being taken seriously, rather than being ignored in the hope they will blow over. The problem is that Kiev is prepared to wait until any fresh insistence on the Minsk agreements being implemented blows over. Just as the West overestimates the absolute influence of Putin, Moscow is mistaken when it sees Ukraine as a mere U.S. satellite. The West may have some levers of influence over Kiev, but nothing can replace the conflict in the Donbas as a source of anti-Russian mobilization within Ukraine, and a way of attracting allies and constantly putting pressure on Moscow in international affairs. Russia would be satisfied with a neutral, friendly, bilingual Ukraine, but that would be seen as a humiliating step backwards by many in Ukraine. For this reason, the danger of renewed hostilities in eastern Ukraine is considerably less virtual than the presidential summit. Handing over responsibility for the Minsk agreements to the United States is Putin’s final attempt to resolve the issue of Ukraine before 2024 — when his current term ends — within the existing legal framework. If that doesn’t work, Putin, who is consolidating his political and historical legacy ahead of 2024, will look for other ways of resolving the Ukraine crisis. It appears that what he manages to achieve in Ukraine will be the deciding factor in whether or not Putin stays on after 2024. From his words and an article on the issue, it’s clear that Putin sees relations with Ukraine as part of his historical mission. That’s not something he wants to leave in less experienced hands, nor to share the credit for in the event of success. And in the event of failure? Well, if victory hasn’t yet been achieved, perhaps it’s not the time to step down.

Putin's comments came as U.S. President Joe Biden was scheduled to speak with Ukraine leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the heads of other countries on Russia's borders concerned over Kremlin military aggression. They came in response to a question during a meeting of the presidential rights council, during which Putin fielded a query on discrimination against Russian speakers beyond Russia's borders. ""I have to say that Russophobia is a first step towards genocide,"" the Russian leader said. ""You and I know what is happening in Donbass,"" referring to the conflict zone in the east of the country, adding that: ""It certainly looks like genocide."" Putin has previously made similar comparisons about the war in eastern Ukraine including in 2015 and 2019. Most people in Ukraine speak both Ukrainian and Russian, though regions in the south and east — and some in the center — are predominantly Russian-speaking and have traditionally been more Russia friendly. A popular uprising in Ukraine forced a Moscow-backed regime out of office in 2014. Since then Moscow has annexed Crimea and Kiev's forces are locked in conflict with separatists supported by Russia in the east of Ukraine. The fighting there has cost some 13,000 lives so far. The United States and its allies have for weeks accused Russia of planning an invasion of Ukraine and massing troops along Kiev's borders.

All three Ukrainian nationals had confessed to being recruited by Ukraine’s military and security services, Interfax quoted the FSB as saying. Ukraine's security service, the SBU, denied the incident, saying the accusation was ""fake"" and part of a ""hybrid war"" effort. The Russian intelligence service said one of those detained had planned to detonate two explosive devices at an undisclosed location. The FSB identified the alleged spy as Oleksandr Tsilyk, who had reportedly confessed to being recruited by the Ukrainian defense ministry's main intelligence directorate. “I was recruited in May 2021,” he was quoted as saying, adding that Ukrainian intelligence had trained him to “work with dead drops and special communications.” A father-and-son pair identified as Zinoviy and Ihor Koval also confessed to being ordered by the Security Service of Ukraine to “photograph road and railway bridges as well as a thermal plant” in exchange for a $10,000 reward, Interfax reported. The FSB’s anti-terrorist unit said it had uncovered “short-barrelled automatic weapons and personal protective equipment” in the pair’s vehicle that were sent for forensic review. The FSB did not disclose where in Russia or when the alleged spies had been detained. Its announcement of arrests comes amid growing warnings from Ukraine and its Western allies that Russia may be gearing up for an early 2022 invasion of Ukraine with a fresh troop buildup. Moscow has in return blamed Kiev for massing tens of thousands of troops near pro-Russia separatist-held territory in southeast Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy this week called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to explicitly deny plans to move Russian troops across the Ukrainian border, which Putin declined to do. Zelenskiy previously disclosed that Ukrainian intelligence services uncovered discussions between Ukrainian and Russian nationals of a Dec. 1-2 coup. The Kremlin denied any involvement.

",English,Russia,"Once again, the world is discussing the possibility of Russia waging war against Ukraine. This time, however, the circumstances are extraordinary. Back in the spring, the buildup of Russian troops for military drills close to Ukraine’s borders ended in a series of communications between the U.S. president and the leaders of Russia and Ukraine, followed by the summit this summer between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Joe Biden. At the time, that flare-up in tensions was explained as being down to the desire to put the Donbass conflict firmly on the agenda of the new U.S. president and to force new talks on the issue. Although the current escalation appears similar to that of the spring, a whole host of new circumstances has been thrown into the mix. The Russian Foreign Ministry has broken a diplomatic taboo by publishing confidential correspondence with Germany and France over Ukraine: something that would have needed to be approved at the very top. Speaking at the Foreign Ministry soon after this, Putin called for “serious, long-term guarantees that ensure Russia’s security in this area [its Western borders], because Russia cannot constantly be thinking about what could happen there tomorrow.” It’s not clear what form such guarantees would take, but it’s likely that ahead of another possible summit between Putin and Biden, Moscow would like to receive assurances similar to those made to Beijing: not to enter into an open conflict with China, and not to try to change the Chinese political system. Instead of such assurances, however, Russia has seen Western military vessels close to Russia’s borders, and a resolution introduced to the U.S. Congress that would automatically declare Putin’s rule illegitimate beyond the next elections in 2024. It seems that Russia does not have the same sway as China to obtain the promises that one superpower has given another. As a recent superpower, Russia considers this particularly unpleasant, and the simmering conflict in eastern Ukraine could be used to give it more clout. The West finds itself, therefore, facing the uncomfortable dilemma of whether to boost Russia’s status, thereby rewarding the dangerous exploitation of a simmering conflict, or to refuse to give Moscow the promises it desires, thus conserving the conflict in its heated state. Russia’s action of releasing the diplomatic correspondence and Putin’s call for guarantees can be interpreted in two ways. Either Moscow has information that Kiev is seriously considering a military solution to the problem of the Donbass separatists, or Russia itself is preparing for a military operation in eastern Ukraine, and these overwrought statements are an attempt to absolve itself of responsibility for its future actions: alas, Moscow had warned of the coming storm, and called for action, but to no avail. The problem is that if implemented, the first scenario of Ukraine taking back Donbass by force would instantly turn into the second: of Russia invading Ukraine. Western journalists and politicians would not have enough time to decide who started it, nor indeed the motivation, since Ukraine would be acting on territory internationally recognized as its own, unlike Russia, which would inevitably be designated the aggressor. Even if Russia were only responding to action taken by Ukraine, it would still be seen as invading: something the West has warned against. Determining how proportionate a response was to the use of force would be a long and difficult process. In Kiev, the tone of Moscow’s statements is seen as a sign that Russia itself is preparing to strike first, and is simply trying to push responsibility for resumed hostilities elsewhere. Russia vividly recalls Georgia’s attempt to regain control over South Ossetia in 2008, which was thwarted by Russia’s intervention. Despite the fact that Georgia’s proactive role in the events of the six-day war is now much clearer (thanks to Wikileaks and the Tagliavini report), that war is still broadly cited as an example of Russian aggression and occupation, since it unfolded on territory internationally accepted as part of Georgia, albeit at the location of a frozen conflict. Georgia’s then president Mikheil Saakashvili’s attack on South Ossetia is still considered to have been prompted by a deliberate provocation by separatists and Moscow. In a situation in which the two sides suspect each other of harboring the worst intentions, and with every hour counting at the start of military action, the South Ossetia scenario could unfold of its own accord. A confrontation on the Donbass demarcation line that goes beyond the regular clashes could prompt a response like that over Ossetia: why wait for the worst to happen? Nor would it be hard to manufacture such an event, should there be any desire to do so. If the West views any events in Donbass in the broader context of a Russian attack on Ukraine’s territorial integrity, and even the restoration of the Russian empire, many in Moscow see those same events as an attack by the Kiev authorities on the integrity of ethnic Russians. In his recent article on Ukrainian history, Putin wrote in startlingly harsh terms about the disappearance of hundreds of thousands of Russians, comparing it to the use of weapons of mass destruction. A man who holds such views is unlikely to simply step down from his post without even trying to stop such an adverse turn of events. What would his successors say? After all, Ukraine was offered the decent option of the Minsk agreements and voluntary federalization, while the West was offered Ukrainian neutrality. The options left are the bad ones. Russia, for its part, is discovering its own worst option. For three decades, the greatest fear of the Russian leadership was that Ukraine (and Belarus) would join NATO and move Western military infrastructure right up to Russia’s borders. Now it turns out that that can happen even without NATO, and in more real and long-term and less predictable ways. An aggrieved country that is building its entire identity on the rejection of everything Russian is far easier to turn into a fortified area on Russia’s border than a country confined by NATO procedures. In the absence of any security guarantees from a bloc, that country will be ready at the drop of a hat to welcome foreign aircraft, ships, and troops, and to equip its own army, leaping into action out of fear. Russia’s military preparations, the publication of the confidential correspondence, and Putin’s call for guarantees on its southwestern flank signal that Moscow has recognized the danger of coexisting with such a fortified area and does not want to accept it, but doesn’t yet know what to do about it. For now, Moscow and Kiev are opting to increase their own significance by showing how — with their restrained and responsible behaviour — they are saving humanity from the danger of a global conflict into which the opposite side would readily drag the world.

Fears that this time, the Kremlin’s actions will culminate in another war have prompted a hastily arranged video call on Ukraine between U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin, due to take place on Dec. 7. So far, all of the Western anxiety and hand-wringing about the crisis seems to be clouding people’s ability to listen to what the Kremlin is actually saying. Until now, there has been surprisingly little Western acknowledgement that Russian President Vladimir Putin is being much blunter about what he wants in Ukraine and the lengths to which he is prepared to go to obtain it. In just a few days, Putin has said that he wants a deal to prevent Ukraine from ever joining NATO. He also wants a Western promise never to deploy NATO military infrastructure in Ukraine. Putin cited U.S. MK-41 missile launchers now in Romania to illustrate what he’s worried about: “I will repeat once again that the issue concerns the possible deployment in the territory of Ukraine of strike systems with the flight time of 7–10 minutes to Moscow, or 5 minutes in the case of hypersonic systems. Just imagine that.” Why is Putin, who sometimes keeps his cards close to the vest, being so specific? Seen from Moscow, it appears that the Kremlin’s key objective in the current crisis is not to inflict a humiliating defeat on Kiev or to take on the unsavory job of occupying Ukraine. Rather it is aimed at persuading the West that Russia is prepared to start a full-scale war over Ukraine unless something is done about the existing and (in Putin’s eyes, at least) completely unacceptable state of affairs. Over the past year, the Kremlin has communicated two simple messages to Biden and his team. First, Russia attaches paramount importance to Ukraine. Second, its patience with the status quo is running thin, and it is ready to take drastic measures to reverse the situation. These messages come in a variety of forms, including harsh public statements, lengthy essays penned by members of the Russian leadership such as Putin himself, and even the publication of confidential correspondence between Moscow and France and Germany on the Donbas conflict. The last step was unprecedented and apparently intended to communicate Russia’s utmost irritation with the stalemate in the implementation of the Minsk agreements aimed at ending the conflict. Moscow’s main concern — preventing Ukraine from joining NATO — is hardly new news. What has changed is that the Kremlin now argues that even if Ukraine never formally accedes to the alliance, it must never be turned into a U.S. military bridgehead on Russia’s border. Other issues are also being identified as must-haves by the Kremlin. It wants to prevent the European Union from linking flows of Russian natural gas to Europe to the Ukrainian conflict. This issue has become more acute in recent months due to the debate over the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was designed to end once and for all the need for export infrastructure passing through Ukrainian territory. Cultural issues are particularly neuralgic. In his extensive article on Russia-Ukraine relations, Putin emphasized the historical affinity and unity of the two nations while harshly accusing the Ukrainian authorities of using coercive assimilation policies to diminish the number of Russians living in Ukraine “by millions.” The use of such strong wording was no coincidence: mass coercive assimilation may constitute a misdeed grave enough to warrant a foreign intervention to stop it. Ever convinced that a kind word and a gun are more efficient than a kind word alone, Russia has accompanied all of these forms of communication with military ones, transforming the security balance on the ground. By moving huge numbers of troops to the Ukrainian border, the Kremlin now has the ability to threaten the country from the south and north, as well as the east. Putin wants Biden to finally face up to an unpleasant dilemma. The message is simple: Washington needs to brace itself for its partner Ukraine to be soundly defeated militarily in what would be an especially humiliating re-run of recent events in Afghanistan. Or it can back down and reach a compromise with Moscow over Ukraine. The Kremlin seems to be under no illusions that the first option would inflict huge costs on Russia’s economy and international standing. But it wants to convince the United States that it is prepared to bear those costs because of the importance of Ukraine for Russian national interests. Putin is also seeking to persuade Washington that unlike Russia, it has little to lose from compromising over Ukraine. The country’s fate is hardly a U.S. vital interest worth going to war over, let alone an important element of the Biden administration’s foreign policy agenda. If Washington doesn’t need Ukraine as an ally in its standoff with China or to fight climate change, why sleepwalk into a possible confrontation with Russia over it? Just a few months ago, Biden showed that he believed U.S. interests in Afghanistan were not sufficient to justify an open-ended troop presence and that he was willing to scale back U.S. commitments in order to adapt his foreign policy to new global realities. In the Kremlin’s view, it is now time for the United States to make a similar rational choice about Ukraine.

Vows to Prevent Any Russian Invasion of Ukraine,English,Russia,"U.S. President Joe Biden said Friday he would make it ""very, very difficult"" for Russia to launch any invasion of Ukraine, which warned that a large-scale attack may be planned for next month. Washington and Kiev say Moscow has massed troops near Ukraine's borders and accuse Russia of planning an invasion. Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin are due to hold a video call in the near future to discuss the rising tensions, both sides confirmed Friday. Biden told reporters in Washington he was putting together ""the most comprehensive and meaningful set of initiatives to make it very, very difficult for Mr Putin to go ahead and do what people are worried he may do."" Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and has since been accused of backing separatists fighting Kiev in the east of the country. The conflict has left more than 13,000 dead. ""The most likely time to reach readiness for escalation will be the end of January,"" Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov told parliament in Kiev on Friday. A report in the Washington Post on Friday citing U.S. officials and an intelligence document said Russia was planning a multi-front offensive involving up to 175,000 troops as soon as next year. Reznikov said a ""winter training period"" had started in Russia and that Moscow had already launched exercises near Ukrainian territory. He estimated that Russia had around 100,000 troops near Ukraine's border. Russia denies any military build-up. On the frontline in eastern Ukraine, government troops said they were ready to repel any Russian assault. ""Our task is simple: not to let the enemy enter our country,"" a soldier named Andriy, 29, told AFP, smoking in a trench near the frontline town of Svitlodarsk. ""All our guys are ready to hold them back. This is our land, we will protect it until the end,"" another soldier, Yevgen, 24, added. Kremlin foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov told reporters a date had been agreed for the Putin-Biden video summit but would not be announced until final details of the talks have also been set. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the call was expected ""in the very near future."" Asked if he had spoken to Putin on Friday morning, Biden shouted ""no"" as he left a press conference in Washington. He gave no further details of his planned ""initiatives"" on Ukraine. Putin has warned the West and Kiev against crossing the Kremlin's ""red lines"" over staging military exercises and building up weaponry in Ukraine. When reporters asked Biden whether he would accept Putin's line, he responded, ""I won't accept anybody's red line."" Despite increased contacts between the two rivals since Putin and Biden met for the first time at a summit in Geneva in June, tensions remain high. As well as the Ukraine conflict, Russia and the United States continue to argue over cyberattacks and the staffing of their embassies, after several waves of diplomatic expulsions. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told AFP on Friday that it rejects any efforts to get it to scrap its plans to join NATO. Moscow wants to see an end to NATO's eastward expansion, after much of Eastern Europe joined the alliance following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Agreeing to abandon its plans to join the alliance ""is not an option,"" Kuleba said on the sidelines of an OSCE meeting in Stockholm. ""I reject this idea that we have to guarantee anything to Russia. I insist that it's Russia who has to guarantee that it will not continue its aggression against any country,"" he said.

Zelenskiy said Friday that Kiev is “entirely prepared” for a potential Russian invasion and added that Ukrainian security services had obtained audio recordings of discussions of a Dec. 1-2 coup. He did not accuse Russia of involvement, though he did say it involved Russian citizens. “Absolutely,” Reuters quoted Prime Minister Denys Shmygal as saying when asked if the Russian state was behind the alleged coup plot. “We have secret data which demonstrates the special intentions [to foment a coup],” Shmygal said on a visit to Brussels for talks with top EU officials. The Ukrainian prime minister added that intelligence had picked up activities of “outside powers” trying to influence Ukraine’s political opposition to whip up popular discontent and a government overthrow. “We understand there was influence from outside to enforce protests in Kiev, to make them stronger. Our secret service is making a special investigation,” Shmygal said. The Kremlin denied any involvement Friday. “We don’t engage in that,” Interfax quoted Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov as telling reporters. Zelenskiy on Friday called on Putin to specifically deny that Russia is “not planning” to invade Ukraine.

The short-notice call came amid high alarm from Washington over Russia’s massing of troops near the Ukrainian border, with reports saying U.S. intelligence has information on a possible Russian invasion as soon as late January. But although the Kremlin described the two-hour discussion as “frank and businesslike,” the path forward for both sides — and Ukraine — remains unclear. Here’s a recap of what the two leaders discussed: Western response if Russia invades Ukraine “President Biden voiced the deep concerns of the United States and our European allies about Russia's escalation of forces surrounding Ukraine,” the White House said in a statement. Biden “made clear that the U.S. and our allies would respond with strong economic and other measures in the event of military escalation.” The U.S. leader also “called for de-escalation and a return to diplomacy,” the statement said. Biden's national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, said there were sanctions that Washington had held back from in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine, but was ""prepared to do now."" According to Bloomberg, these would include fresh restrictions on the Russian ruble, Russian sovereign debt, and on some of the country’s largest financial institutions. Cutting off Russia from the SWIFT international payment system is also on the table if there is an invasion. Nord Stream 2 Following the call, U.S. officials made clear that if the Russian leader does take military action against Ukraine, freezing the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline and its money-earning potential would be a key mode of retaliation. The 10 billion-euro ($12 billion) pipeline, majority-owned by Russian giant Gazprom, was completed in September, just around the time the Russian buildup of some 100,000 troops near the border with Ukraine began. “It is leverage for the West, because if Vladimir Putin wants to see gas flow through that pipeline, he may not want to take the risk of invading Ukraine,” said White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. Putin’s ‘red lines’ The Kremlin said Putin blamed NATO for tensions in Ukraine and insisted on “legal guarantees” against the Western military alliance expanding its forces any closer to Russia. Putin says he sees Ukraine's growing alliance with Western nations as a threat to Russian security — and that any move by Ukraine to join NATO or to host NATO missiles would be unacceptable. “Russia is seriously interested in obtaining reliable legal guarantees that will exclude NATO's eastward expansion and the deployment of offensive strike weapons in countries adjacent to Russia,” the Kremlin said. Restoring diplomatic missions Biden and Putin discussed options for restoring both countries’ diplomatic missions, which have been left hamstrung by several rounds of tit-for-tat diplomat expulsions. The U.S. Embassy in Russia has been forced to suspend nearly all services. “The Russian side proposed to annul all the accumulated restrictions on the functioning of diplomatic missions, which could also serve to normalize other aspects of bilateral relations,” the Kremlin said. What else was discussed? Putin and Biden also discussed bilateral strategic stability plans set in place at their June summit in Geneva, efforts to fight ransomware and cybercrime and joint work on regional issues such as Iran. What wasn’t discussed? The pair did not discuss the poisoning and jailing of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, the banning of his groups as “extremist” or the controversial results of this year’s parliamentary elections. While Washington has criticized Russia over these issues, Moscow views such criticisms as interference in its domestic affairs. Washington’s accusations of Russian meddling in its presidential elections were also absent from the conversation. What are the results? Apart from agreeing to keep dialogue open in the interests of maintaining international security, Biden and Putin appear to have failed to make any significant breakthroughs. The White House did not say how Biden responded to Putin’s request for guarantees to halt NATO’s expansion or block Ukraine’s path to membership. Sullivan told reporters that Biden ""made no such commitments or concessions."" Biden is expected to speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Thursday. Asked if Russia planned to draw down troops after the summit, the Kremlin's top foreign policy adviser Yury Ushakov said: ""Russian troops are on their territory, they are threatening no one, the president has said so."" Ushakov insisted that a possible invasion of Ukraine by Russia had not been discussed.

""I made it very clear, if in fact he invades Ukraine, there will be severe consequences, severe consequences -- economic consequences like none he's ever seen or ever have been seen,"" Biden told reporters at the White House. Biden said that in addition to economic measures, a new Russian attack on Ukraine would trigger a bolstered US military presence on the territory of NATO allies in eastern Europe. ""We would probably be required to reinforce our presence in NATO countries to reassure particularly those in the eastern flank. In addition to that, I made it clear that we would provide a defensive capability to the Ukrainians as well,"" he said. However, Biden said that sending US troops to defend Ukraine from Russia is ""not on the cards,"" because the country is not part of NATO. ""The idea the United States is going to unilaterally use force to confront Russia invading Ukraine is not on the cards right now,"" Biden said. ""We have a moral obligation and a legal obligation to our NATO allies under Article Five. It's a sacred obligation. That obligation does not extend to... Ukraine.""

The foreign ministry also demanded that NATO stop conducting military exercises close to Russia's borders and added that this and other security proposals would be unveiled ""in the near future."" Earlier this week Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. leader Joe Biden held two hours of talks, with the Kremlin chief demanding that the West put in writing guarantees that Ukraine would not become a NATO launchpad. In the past few weeks Russia moved around 100,000 troops to Ukraine's border. Putin did not say whether Moscow planned to go on the attack but insisted the country has a right to defend its security. On Friday, the Russian foreign ministry said the United States should formally close the door both to Ukraine and Georgia, which were promised in 2008 they would become members one day. ""In the fundamental interests of European security, it is necessary to officially disavow the decision of the 2008 NATO Bucharest summit that 'Ukraine and Georgia will become NATO members,'"" the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement. By supporting Ukraine and Georgia's aspirations, NATO is violating the basic principle of all OSCE participating states to ""not strengthen their security at the expense of the security"" of other states, Moscow said. The military bloc should also guarantee that weapons threatening Russia's security will not be deployed on the country's western borders — by either NATO members or other countries, the ministry said. Moscow also said it wanted to receive a ""concrete"" reaction from NATO regarding a number of earlier proposals, including a demand to move military exercises away from the ""contact line"" between NATO and Russian forces. It added that ""regular dialogue"" between defence officials of Russia, the United States and NATO should resume. Ukraine is nowhere near entering NATO, but the United States helps train Ukrainian forces and has committed more than $2.5 billion to bolster a military that crumpled in the face of the Russian assault back in 2014.",1,358,93.96,25.06,32.66,27.64,29.83,31.84,83.52,56.42,43.58,5.59,0.56,0,0,0,0,0.56,5.03,16.76,9.78,2.51,13.41,5.31,1.68,5.31,1.4,11.73,7.26,4.19,7.82,1.4,0.84,5.59,10.89,0.56,10.06,0.84,0.84,2.51,0.28,1.12,3.91,0,2.23,1.4,0.84,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.94,6.15,0.28,0.28,0.84,0,3.35,2.51,0,0,0,0,8.66,6.7,1.96,0,0.56,0,0,0.28,0.28,0,0.28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.28,0.56,0.28,0,0,0,0,1.96,0.56,2.51,10.61,0.56,1.68,8.66,0,0,0,3.07,5.03,1.96,1.68,0,0,0,0,0,14.53,4.19,3.63,0,0,2.51,4.19

The behind-closed-doors talks came after weeks of rising tensions between Moscow and Washington, as a buildup of Russian troops on its border with Ukraine has sparked fears of a return to all-out hostilities between the two sides. But although the Kremlin described the two-hour discussion as ""frank and businesslike,"" the two leaders appear to have failed to reach a major compromise. Biden ""voiced the deep concerns"" of the U.S. and its European allies toward ""Russia’s escalation of forces surrounding Ukraine"" and vowed ""strong economic and other measures"" in response to a Russian offensive, the White House said in its readout of the call. ""President Biden reiterated his support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and called for de-escalation and a return to diplomacy,"" the White House added. In response, Putin accused NATO of ""making dangerous attempts to conquer Ukrainian territory"" and ""building up its military potential at our borders"" and reiterated his desire for legal guarantees that NATO will not expand any further eastward. The Kremlin said Putin described the current situation as a result of ""Ukraine's internal crisis"" and ""lack of progress"" in implementing the 2015 Minsk peace agreement. Putin also pointed to Ukraine's so-called ""destructive stance"" and its ""provocative actions"" against the eastern Donbass region, the Kremlin readout added. Apart from Ukraine, both the Kremlin and the White House said the two leaders discussed bilateral strategic stability plans set in place at their June summit in Geneva, efforts to fight ransomware and cybercrime and joint work on regional issues such as Iran. The Kremlin added that the two leaders discussed the problem of their countries' ""curtailed"" diplomatic missions following several rounds of tit-for-tat expulsions. ""The Russian side proposed to annul all the accumulated restrictions on the functioning of diplomatic missions, which could also serve to normalize other aspects of bilateral relations,"" the Kremlin said. Biden and Putin agreed that their representatives will maintain a dialogue on these issues, both sides' readouts said. The White House said Biden called the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Italy after the summit to follow up on coordinations between the leaders that took place Monday ahead of the Putin talks. He will also speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Thursday, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said.

Russia has denied the accusations of military posturing as ""hysteria"" and maintains it is responding to a Ukrainian buildup and NATO provocations. ""Russia has never planned to attack anyone,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said ahead of Tuesday's talks. ""But we have our own red lines."" Mosow has made clear its desire for the U.S. to guarantee that Ukraine will not join NATO, and that deepening Kiev’s informal cooperation with the Western military alliance will be halted. Washington meanwhile has said that no country can block Ukraine's path to NATO membership. Kiev has been locked in a bitter war with pro-Russian separatists in its eastern Donbass region since 2014, the same year Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine. The conflict has claimed over 13,000 lives. Biden was expected to threaten sanctions that would go far beyond those introduced in response to the annexation of Crimea, as well as boosted military support in Eastern Europe, in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine. According to Bloomberg, the sanctions would include fresh restrictions on the Russian ruble, Russian sovereign debt, and on some of the country’s largest financial institutions. The New York Times has reported that cutting off Russia from the SWIFT international payment system is also under discussion if there is an invasion.

The key question hanging over the talks — and the subject of keen debate among analysts and political leaders — is whether Putin might actually launch a cross-border offensive, or whether he is using the troops to pressure Biden for guarantees ex-Soviet Ukraine will never become a NATO launchpad. The two have a daunting list of other differences to air, from Russia's harsh treatment of dissidents to the presence of ransomware hackers on Russian soil to Moscow's support for the repressive regime in Syria. But the magnitude of the Russian buildup near Ukraine — the Kremlin may be planning an offensive early in 2022 involving up to 175,000 troops, according to U.S. intelligence obtained by The Washington Post and other outlets — has raised red flags in Washington and across Europe. Many analysts doubt that Putin would carry through with an invasion — which would inevitably prompt international condemnation and probably new sanctions — but at least some take a darker view. ""Putin has sharply raised the stakes. He is no longer bluffing,"" said Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of the political consultancy R.Politik Center and a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Moscow Center. ""He's ready to take a desperate step,"" she told AFP on Sunday. The looming crisis could pose the sternest test yet of the foreign policy savvy and clout of the 78-year-old U.S. president. Biden and Putin — who are expected to speak around midday Tuesday, Washington time — have a history together. They first met in person in the Kremlin in 2011. Then-vice president Biden later said he told the Russian leader, ""I don't think you have a soul"" (to which, Biden says, Putin responded, ""We understand one another."") They met again in 2014 in Geneva to deal with the now-familiar issue of Russian military pressure on Ukraine. And they met in Geneva on June 16 of this year — for the first time with Biden as president. Contacts have continued since — as have tensions, with Putin seen as eager to pressure Biden into another in-person summit as a way to project parity on the world stage. On Friday, Biden vowed to make it ""very, very difficult"" for Russia to launch an invasion but did not say how. Putin has warned the West and Kiev against crossing the Kremlin's ""red lines,"" including building up weaponry in Ukraine. Biden later responded, ""I won't accept anybody's red line."" Some analysts said Russia, deeply concerned with Ukraine's warming ties to NATO, is applying pressure to cut that movement short. Following Putin's lead, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday called on U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to provide ""security guarantees"" that NATO would not come closer to Russia's border. Stanovaya said this might be Putin's bottom line: ""Either NATO provides guarantees or Russia invades Ukraine,"" she said. Russia has continued to deny any bellicose intentions, instead accusing the West of provocations in the Black Sea. NATO recognized Kiev in June 2020 as one of a handful of so-called ""enhanced opportunity partners,"" potentially a step toward membership. Heather Conley, a former assistant U.S. secretary of state for European affairs, said she believes Putin is willing to apply ""enormous pressure"" in the Ukraine standoff. He is set on another in-person summit with Biden, said Conley, who is with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. And he wants to loosen Western ties to Ukraine which, she said, some see as ""a sort of NATO aircraft carrier."" Fyodor Lukyanov, a prominent political analyst close to the Kremlin, said he doubts Biden and Putin will agree on anything concrete on Tuesday, but he does not expect hostilities to break out if the talks fail. ""No, this is hysteria whipped up by the West,"" he told AFP on Sunday. ""Wars begin suddenly. If it begins, it will begin differently."" Moscow seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and has since backed the separatist forces fighting Kiev. The conflict has left more than 13,000 dead. What if the virtual meeting between the rival leaders goes poorly on Tuesday? If Russia fails to obtain the accommodations it seeks, and all efforts at diplomacy fail, said Conley, her sense is that ""Mr. Putin would then use military means to achieve his political objective.""",1,735,93.73,42.46,39.11,9.69,21.62,27.21,80.82,60.27,45.03,6.12,3.4,0.27,0.14,0.14,2.04,0.54,2.72,12.24,8.03,2.04,16.33,5.58,2.31,5.58,1.09,13.74,7.35,2.99,5.99,0.82,1.36,4.08,11.56,0.54,10.88,1.5,1.5,0.95,2.72,0.68,4.22,0,4.49,1.63,2.72,1.09,0,0.95,0.14,0.54,0,0,11.97,6.39,0.27,0.14,1.22,0.41,3.54,5.71,0,0,0.68,1.5,5.71,4.63,0.95,0.14,3.4,0,0,3.27,0,0.14,0.14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.14,0.68,0.14,0.82,0,0,0,0.27,0.68,0,2.59,11.02,0.27,1.9,7.48,1.09,0,0.41,4.22,4.08,3.95,2.45,0.27,0.14,0.14,0,0,18.5,5.85,5.31,0.14,0,1.5,5.71

U.S. intelligence and NATO allies believe Russia will be ready to conduct an invasion with 175,000 troops by the beginning of 2022. The magnitude of the Russian mobilization on the border makes it hard for the Kremlin this time round to walk back empty-handed. The virtual meeting between U.S. President Biden and Russian President Putin did not suggest a breakthrough in negotiations. The debates in and among the NATO and EU countries about how to respond to Russia’s saber-rattling have devolved into two antagonistic camps, which seems symptomatic of the Western polarization on most foreign-policy issues nowadays. Public debate is healthy when it balances a variety of concerns, but emotional polarization may fail to unite the Western countries around a calibrated policy. The first camp favors accommodating Moscow’s long-standing security concerns if that is what it takes to prevent war. The most debated proposal advocates Kiev to implement the Minsk Agreement concluded in 2015 to solve the conflict in the Donbass, even though this risks giving Russia a de facto veto over Ukraine’s foreign-policy decisions. Others argue that NATO and the United States should find a modus vivendi with Russia, starting with a willingness to bring into play NATO’s Open-Door policy, which today seems pointless to cling to since Ukraine anyway is unlikely to join the alliance. Their implicit assumption is that Russia acts defensively to prevent the the encroachment of rival alliance on its border. The second camp is vehemently opposed to giving in to Russian demands, some even accusing the former of appeasement or of taking a pro-Putin line. They claim pressuring Kiev to unilaterally implement the Minsk Agreement is both immoral and strategically ill-advised since it will invite more Russian aggression. Their explicit assumption is that Russia has broader expansionist ambitions that only superior force can tame – in the present crisis by threatening exclusion from the SWIFT banking system, sanctioning its debt markets, and ending Nord Stream II. While advocating increased military support of Ukraine, no serious policymaker has proposed combat-ready deployments to deter Russian aggression in Ukraine akin to what NATO membership would require. Either way, the premise of Western policy remains unwillingness to intervene militarily on behalf of Ukraine. It now falls on its diplomacy to test the nature of the Russian threat. Putin earlier this year published an essay essentially making the case that Russia and Ukraine make up one people, which was a pre-warning about the Kremlin’s dissatisfaction with status quo in Ukraine. Contrary to the claims of recent commentary, President Putin in the current escalation has been quite specific about his demands: a deal that prevents Ukraine from joining NATO, accompanied by a Western pledge not to deploy military infrastructure in the country. This is consistent with the findings of a recent Carnegie report asserting that Kremlin is as worried about ‘Ukraine in NATO’ as it is about ‘NATO in Ukraine’. In no circumstance could the Western countries agree to conceding Ukraine to a Russian sphere of influence. Pressuring Kiev to implement the Minsk Agreement may not be the best starting point, since that risks giving Russia a veto not only over Ukraine’s military orientation but also its economic and political affiliation with the EU. Instead, Western diplomacy should confine itself to Putin’s specific demands about NATO. It is a long-standing controversy for the Kremlin that gives reason to explore its significance for Ukraine-Russia and West-Russia stability. Considering the utility of the Open-Door policy is no longer as controversial as it was, say, 13 years ago when NATO agreed that Ukraine and Georgia ‘will become members’. Today, this is all but a distant aspiration for well-known both domestic and geopolitical reasons. Other than the general principle that all sovereign countries in Europe are free to choose their alliance affiliations, it is also unclear which NATO allies really wish to extend collective defense guarantees to Ukraine. The growing tension with Russia and the migrant grey-zone attack from Belarus seem to have changed the mood even in the Baltic States and Poland, whose security so crucially depends on the unambiguity of NATO’s collective defense guarantees. NATO could never agree to a ‘closed door’ policy but, if prompted by U.S. leadership, perhaps to negotiate about language that in exchange would commit Russia not to use military force against Ukraine and to solve the conflict in the Donbass. Such language should signal what is already the reality: that NATO has the intention neither to enlarge, nor to station military infrastructure in Ukraine in the current security environment. Negotiations should be treated strictly as a question of military neutrality, without concessions on NATO’s continued advising, training, and funding of Ukraine’s armed forces. It is necessary to factor in the two understandings of the Russian threat here. Should President Putin change his aggressive westward posture, concession on NATO may prove the right path for a more managed great-power rivalry with Russia (moreover, setting the United States on a firmer course to compete with China). Conversely, should Putin feel emboldened to threaten Ukraine and to further push Western lines, NATO has the option of backtracking its language. Rhetoric that does not hold the West back from more than what it might theoretical do seems to be its cheapest bargaining chip. Meanwhile, the Western debate tends to forget that Ukraine achieved what its Euromaidan Revolution in 2013-14 was essentially about: reaching an Association Agreement with the EU. While Ukraine’s exports to the EU and the rest of the world have grown, Ukraine still has not recovered economically to its pre-2014 level. This testifies to the significant domestic problems Ukraine must overcome to achieve prosperity. The more the West can convince Ukraine to define its destiny as one of fight against economic insecurity rather than of geopolitical choice and NATO membership, the more that process is likely to be surrounded by stability.",1,978,92.41,24.25,33.33,8.7,25.74,32.92,80.16,57.77,46.93,6.34,0.72,0,0,0,0.2,0.41,5.62,15.54,9,1.33,16.16,6.03,4.19,4.91,1.33,10.74,6.24,2.76,7.98,1.84,1.12,5.11,12.68,0.61,11.96,2.86,1.94,1.53,2.04,0.51,3.78,0.1,4.19,1.33,2.56,1.12,0,0.82,0.2,0.51,0,0,7.77,6.03,0.92,0,1.94,0.2,1.53,2.15,0,0,0,0.2,5.42,4.4,0.92,0.1,2.35,0.1,0,1.43,0.92,0,0.31,0.31,0.1,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0.41,0.2,0.2,0,0,0,0,1.43,0.1,2.86,7.87,0,0.61,6.95,0,0,0.31,3.27,1.53,4.19,1.33,0.2,0,0.2,0,0,12.37,4.5,3.48,0,0,1.53,2.86

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the conversation will take place in the evening Russia time and the two leaders will determine the duration, according to Russian news agencies. Biden said Friday he would make it ""very, very difficult"" for Russia to launch any invasion of Ukraine, which warned that a large-scale attack may be planned for next month. Washington and Kiev say Moscow has massed troops near Ukraine's borders and accuse Russia of planning an invasion. Russia has denied any bellicose intentions and accused the West of provocation, particularly with military exercises in the Black Sea, which it sees as part of its sphere of influence. Biden and Putin had been expected since Friday to hold a video call. Biden told reporters in Washington he was putting together ""the most comprehensive and meaningful set of initiatives to make it very, very difficult for Mr Putin to go ahead and do what people are worried he may do"". Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and has since been accused of backing separatists fighting Kiev in the east of the country. The conflict has killed more than 13,000. Moscow, meanwhile, wants to see an end to NATO's eastward expansion, after much of eastern Europe joined the alliance following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday called on his U.S. counterpart Antony Blinken to provide ""security guarantees"" that NATO would not come closer to Russia's borders. Despite increased contacts between the two rivals since Putin and Biden met for the first time at a summit in Geneva in June, tensions remain high.

Deputy Foreign Ministry Sergei Ryabkov’s threat follows Moscow’s complaints over NATO weapons deployment in Eastern Europe and Western warnings of Russia’s imminent invasion of Ukraine. “Our response will be military” if the Western military bloc does not guarantee an end to its eastward expansion, Ryabkov told the state-run RIA Novosti news agency. “There will be confrontation,” he added, warning that Moscow would deploy weapons that were previously banned under the INF Treaty, which expired in 2019. “Currently, [these banned weapons] do not exist; we have a unilateral moratorium. We call on NATO and the United States to join this moratorium,” Ryabkov said, lamenting that “they just don’t respond to our proposals.” “There’s basically no trust in NATO,” the senior diplomat told RIA Novosti. “Therefore, we’re no longer playing this kind of game and don’t believe NATO’s assurances.” Elsewhere in Monday’s interview, Ryabkov derided the United States’ “inexplicable fixation” on the threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine. “This isn’t so and cannot be,” he said. Russian President Vladimir Putin held a videoconference with U.S. President Joe Biden last week, where he did not say whether he planned to go on the attack but insisted that Russia has a right to defend its security.

The group itself, said by Western capitals to work on behalf of the Kremlin in conflict zones, was targeted with an asset freeze, along with eight individuals and three firms, diplomats said. The sanctions list was drawn up by EU officials and unanimously approved by foreign ministers, who met Monday to discuss various world crises and prepare Thursday's summit of European leaders. ""Wagner is a Russian private military company used to destabilize security in Europe and in its neighborhood, notably in Africa,"" one European diplomat said. Wagner is said to be financed by 60-year-old St. Petersburg businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, reputedly close to President Vladimir Putin, who has already been hit with EU and U.S. sanctions for destabilizing Libya and meddling in U.S. elections. Those sanctioned included: Dmitry Utkin, a 51-year-old former lieutenant colonel in Russian military intelligence — once decorated by Putin — now said to be Wagner's commander and responsible for mercenary operations in Ukraine. Utkin is accused of extrajudicial killings, including allegedly ordering a Syrian deserter to be tortured to death and filmed. Alexander Kuzentsov, a 44-year-old Russian said to be commander of Wagner's 1st Attack and Reconnaissance Company under the call sign ""Ratibor,"" accused of threatening the peace and security of Libya. Retired colonel Andrei Roshev, 68, a founding executive director of Wagner now commanding mercenary troops in Syria in support of Bashar al-Assad's regime under the call sign ""Siedoy."" Wagner units and operatives have been seen in several conflict zones, allegedly serving Russian private and state interests in Ukraine, Syria and Libya. The firm has also offered its services to local authorities in sub-Saharan Africa, including former French colonies Mali and the Central African Republic.

During their summit by secure video link Tuesday, Biden warned Putin of a ""strong"" Western economic response should Moscow attack its neighbor. The talks were seen as a chance to lower tensions on the Russian-Ukrainian border, where Moscow has deployed up to 100,000 troops, sparking fears of a major war. ""Russia has a peaceful foreign policy, but has the right to defend its security,"" Putin said at a news conference with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. He refused to say if Moscow planned to move troops massing on Ukraine's frontier across the border, but said that simply watching NATO move closer to Russia would amount to ""criminal inaction."" ""We cannot but be concerned about the prospect of Ukraine's possible admission to NATO, because this will undoubtedly be followed by the deployment of appropriate military contingents, bases and weapons that threaten us,"" he said. The Russian leader stressed that NATO expanding eastwards is a ""very sensitive"" issue for Russia. ""It is one of the key questions in preserving Russia's security,"" he said, adding that Russia had been ""warning"" NATO against any expansion. Putin told Biden on Tuesday that Moscow seeks legal guarantees from the West that Ukraine would not join NATO. The Russian leader nonetheless hailed the talks with Biden as ""constructive,"" saying the pair agreed to continue dialogue. France on Wednesday said it had sent ""strong messages"" to Russia warning that it would face ""strategic and massive consequences"" if it attacked Ukraine. The French foreign ministry statement came after telephone talks this week between the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, the UK and the U.S. It said that the so-called Quint of the five Western allies had in their talks ""expressed their determination that the sovereignty of Ukraine be respected."" The same day, Russia said sent planes to intercept and ""escort"" three French military plans flying near its borders in the Black Sea, in a rise of tensions. Moscow's defence ministry said its pilots escorted French Mirage-2000 and Rafale planes after stopping them from violating the Russian border. It is the latest sign of tensions in the Black Sea, a sensitive region for Russia which controls the Crimea peninsula after annexing it from Ukraine in 2014. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy — who has said he is ready to negotiate with Putin — said it was ""positive"" that Putin and Biden spoke. ""I think it's positive that the president of the United States spoke with the president of Russia,"" Zelenskiy said. He is due to hold talks with Biden on Thursday. ""I believe that Ukraine's victory lies in the fact that the United States has always supported Ukraine, our sovereignty and independence,"" Zelenskiy said at a press conference with Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic. He said it was ""important"" that Biden had taken a ""personal role in resolving the conflict"" in eastern Ukraine. Ex-Soviet Ukraine has been fighting pro-Russia separatists in its eastern Lugansk and Donetsk regions since 2014, shortly after Moscow seized Crimea.

As Lavrov warned that the ""nightmare scenario of a military confrontation was returning"" in Europe Blinken said it was ""likely the presidents will speak directly in the near future."" Russia also said that it hopes for ""contact"" between Putin and Biden in the coming days. ""The date has not yet been agreed.

Attending a meeting in Stockholm of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Lavrov accused NATO of inching its military infrastructure closer to Russia's borders.

The British leader echoed concern from the G7 on Sunday about the build-up of Russian forces on the border, urging a diplomatic solution to the stand-off, his office said. His intervention comes after a two-day meeting of the G7 in which the grouping's top diplomats warned Moscow of ""massive consequences"" if it invades the former Soviet state. Direct contact between London and Moscow has been rare since London expelled dozens of Russian diplomats following a chemical weapon attack in the English city of Salisbury. Britain blamed Russia for the 2018 attempted murder of former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with the Cold War-era nerve agent Novichok. It had already accused the Kremlin of being behind the radiation poisoning death of another former Russian agent, Alexander Litvinenko, in London in 2016. Downing Street said Johnson told Putin of his ""deep concern"" at the Russian troop build-up on the border with Ukraine, which Moscow says is defensive. He ""reiterated the importance of working through diplomatic channels to deescalate tensions and identify durable solutions,"" the government statement said. ""The prime minister emphasized the U.K.'s commitment to Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty, and warned that any destabilizing action would be a strategic mistake that would have significant consequences.""

The US and its allies have for weeks accused Russia of planning an invasion of its neighbour, warning of a massive coordinated sanctions response should Putin launch an attack. Tens of thousands of Russian troops are stationed near the borders of ex-Soviet Ukraine, where the West has accused the Kremlin of backing pro-Moscow separatists since 2014. In a phone call with the Finnish president — whose country has traditionally served as middle ground between Russia and the West — Putin said he wanted security talks to begin without delay. He told President Sauli Niinsto that Moscow wants ""to immediately launch negotiations with the United States and NATO in order to develop international legal guarantees for the security of our country,"" the Kremlin said in a statement. Russia's demands, it said, included stopping NATO from expanding east and the deployment of weapons in neighboring states, including Ukraine. Putin reiterated the same demands in a phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron later on Tuesday. In his call with the Finnish president, Putin also accused the Ukrainian leadership of increasingly using ""heavy weapons and attack drones"" against pro-Russia rebels in its separatist east. The Russian leader denies planning an invasion, blaming the Western security alliance for the rise in tensions and demanding ""legal guarantees"" the alliance won't expand eastwards. U.S. President Joe Biden last week warned Putin of ""sanctions like he's never seen"" should Russian troops massed on the Ukrainian border launch an attack. The EU and the G7 met in recent days to coordinate what they warn would be an unprecedented economic sanctions regime if Russia attacks. Putin's comments come a day after Russia's deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov warned Moscow could act militarily if the talks it demands do not materialize. ""The lack of progress towards a political-diplomatic solution to this problem will lead to the fact that we will respond militarily,"" Ryabkov told the RIA Novosti state news agency. Tensions continued to soar Tuesday, with Russia saying it was monitoring a French warship near its borders in the Black Sea. The Russian army last week said it scrambled three of its jets to escort five French and U.S. military aircraft over the sea. Putin has accused the West of provoking tensions in the Black Sea, decrying U.S.-led military exercises there. The Black Sea is a sensitive region for Russia, which controls the Crimean peninsula after annexing it from Ukraine in 2014. Kiev has been fighting a pro-Russia insurgency in its eastern regions since the annexation. The conflict has claimed more than 13,000 lives. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, meanwhile, accused Kiev's ally Germany of blocking a supply of NATO weapons to the country. ""Germany has recently prevented us from getting anti-drone rifles and anti-sniper systems from NATO, which are exclusively defense tools,"" Zelenskiy said in an interview with Italian newspaper La Repubblica published Tuesday. ""Don't we have the right to have them in the eighth year of the war? Obviously, we do,"" he added. A spokesperson for the German foreign ministry said Monday that it could not comment ""on the confidential decisions at the heart of the (NATO) alliance at this stage."" Zelenskiy's comments come after Ukraine said in November it was seeking more military aid from its Western allies to deter Russia from an attack. The Ukraine leader warned of ""much higher losses"" in the event of an invasion. ""Is Russian society ready to pay with the lives of its sons for the attempt to occupy another part of Ukraine?"" he asked. The West for a long time hesitated to sell arms to Kiev, but Ukraine eventually managed to get some defense systems — including Turkish-made Bayraktar drones. Kiev's use of the drones in October was met with criticism from Russia and some of its Western allies, including France and Germany.",1,660,97.7,63.38,36.45,1.23,22,30.76,81.67,55.45,43.18,6.21,2.27,0,0.76,0,1.06,0.3,3.94,14.55,10.45,1.21,16.36,4.55,1.67,3.79,0.76,10.91,5,3.33,10,2.42,0.76,6.97,7.42,0.15,7.12,0.76,1.52,1.36,0.45,0.61,2.42,0,3.94,0.3,3.64,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.85,9.24,1.52,0,1.97,0.91,4.85,6.36,0.15,0.15,0,1.21,7.73,5.45,1.97,0.3,1.97,0,0.3,1.21,0.45,0,0.61,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.45,0.3,0.15,0,0,0,1.67,0,2.73,12.73,0.91,1.06,9.55,0.61,0,0.91,4.85,4.09,3.03,1.52,0,0,0,0,0,15.3,5.15,3.33,0.3,0,1.52,5

Russia has been accused of preparing to invade Ukraine and is amassing tens of thousands of troops close to the Ukrainian border, according to satellite images and Western intelligence reports. Moscow says it is not planning to attack and is responding to Ukrainian military posturing. Just 12% of Ukrainians said they see Russia as an ally, according to the survey by Ukrainian polling organization Rating Group published Friday. Despite this week’s call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his U.S. counterpart Joe Biden, fears remain high and the rhetoric about a possible confrontation has ramped up. In stark comments issued Thursday, Putin said the ongoing conflict between pro-Russia separatists and forces loyal to Kiev in eastern Ukraine “looks a lot like genocide.” Rating Group conducted its survey between Dec. 6-8 —  as Putin held his high-profile video call with Biden — and had 2,500 respondents from Ukraine, excluding Russia-annexed Crimea as well as the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk republics, which have been under separatist control since 2014. In April, when Russia was similarly accused of mounting a significant troop buildup near the Ukrainian border, 76% of Ukrainians said Russia was “hostile.” Some 14,000 people have died in the seven-year conflict between Ukraine and pro-Russian forces. Despite a ceasefire agreement, violations are rife and dozens of fighters from both sides are killed every year. A majority of Ukrainians want that agreement — named the Minsk accords — to be revised, the survey found. The survey also showed Ukrainians have grown significantly more negative toward Belarus over the past eight months as strongman leader Alexander Lukashenko has aligned himself more closely with Moscow amid international isolation. Almost half — 48% — of the respondents said Belarus was a “hostile state,” up from 22% in the previous survey.",1,312,96.3,47.66,35.18,1,22.29,32.37,75.64,54.49,43.27,2.88,1.28,0,0,0,0.96,0.32,1.6,12.82,7.37,4.49,17.31,6.09,2.56,5.77,0.32,11.22,6.09,5.13,5.77,1.28,0.32,4.17,6.41,0.32,6.09,0.64,1.6,0.32,0.64,0,2.56,0,6.09,1.28,4.81,1.6,0,1.6,0.32,1.28,0,0,11.22,7.37,0.64,0,3.85,0.96,2.88,4.17,0,0.32,0,0.96,3.21,1.28,1.92,0,1.6,0,0,1.6,0,0,0.96,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.96,0,0.32,0.32,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.53,11.86,0,0,10.26,1.28,0,0.32,3.85,6.41,3.85,0.64,0,0,0,0,0,16.03,5.13,4.49,0,0,0.32,6.09

Judges in Berlin sentenced Russian Vadim Krasikov, alias Vadim Sokolov, to life in jail after finding him guilty of gunning down Georgian national Tornike Kavtarashvili, 40, in a Berlin park in broad daylight on Aug. 23, 2019. ""Russian state authorities ordered the accused to liquidate the victim,"" presiding judge Olaf Arnoldi said, agreeing with prosecutors that the murder had been carefully planned. The murder was meant ""as retaliation"" for being a Kremlin opponent, the judge added. Moscow immediately slammed what it called a ""political"" ruling against a backdrop of ""general anti-Russian sentiment."" ""We consider this verdict to be a biased, politically-motivated decision that seriously aggravates already difficult Russian-German relations,"" Russia's ambassador to Germany, Sergei Nechayev, said in a statement. The ruling is the first major stress test for Germany's new government, which has vowed a tougher stance towards Russia, and comes amid growing alarm in the West about Russian troop movements on the border with Ukraine. New Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said she had summoned Moscow's ambassador to inform him that Germany was expelling two Russian diplomats in response to the court's ruling. ""This murder by order of the state as determined by the court today constitutes a serious violation of German law and sovereignty,"" Baerbock told reporters. Shortly after the murder in Berlin's Kleiner Tiergarten Park, Germany under then-chancellor Angela Merkel expelled two Russian diplomats in protest at Moscow's perceived lack of cooperation with the investigation. Russia, denying any connection to the killing, responded with a tit-for-tat move. According to German prosecutors, the suspect shot Kavtarashvili from behind on a bicycle, firing two shots from a Glock 26 pistol equipped with a silencer. After the victim fell to the ground, Krasikov is accused of then shooting him in the head, killing him on the spot, before getting back on his bicycle and fleeing. Police divers later recovered the handgun, a wig and a bicycle from the nearby Spree river. Calling for Krasikov to be jailed for life as they summed up their case last week, prosecutors said they had identified him as a ""commander of a special unit of Russian secret services FSB."" ""He liquidated a political opponent,"" prosecutor Lars Malkies told the court. But in an earlier hearing, the defendant had told the court through his lawyer Robert Unger that he should be identified only as Vadim Sokolov, who is ""Russian, single and a construction engineer."" He denied being known as Krasikov, saying ""I know of no one by this name."" Prosecutors say the defendant traveled as a tourist in the days before the murder, arriving on Aug. 17 in Paris where he visited sights before traveling to Warsaw. Photos of his tourist cover were found on a mobile phone in the Polish hotel where he stayed before heading to Berlin on Aug. 22. The trial has spanned a period of particularly rocky ties between Berlin and Moscow over a series of espionage cases, as well as the poisoning and jailing of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. Russia denies all allegations. The verdict also comes as Russia stands accused by the West of planning an invasion of Ukraine and massing tens of thousands of troops near its neighbor's border. Germany's new government has taken a sharp tone with Moscow, warning that it will not approve the controversial Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia in the event of any new ""escalation"" in Ukraine. Chancellor Olaf Scholz issued a fresh warning on Wednesday, saying Russia would pay ""a high price"" if it invaded its neighbor. Russian President Vladimir Putin has described the Tiergarten victim as a ""fighter, very cruel and bloody"" who had joined separatists against Russian forces in the Caucasus and also been involved in bombing attacks on the Moscow metro. Moscow also said it had been seeking his extradition. According to German media, the victim survived two assassination attempts in Georgia before seeking asylum in Germany, where he had been living for several years.",1,690,97.77,68.03,27.24,1,22.26,30,75.8,54.93,43.62,5.8,3.33,0.14,0.14,0,2.32,0.43,2.46,14.49,10.29,2.32,17.39,4.2,2.17,5.22,0.29,10.58,4.49,2.46,8.41,1.01,0.29,7.1,5.36,0.43,4.93,2.32,0.43,0.43,0.43,0.14,1.16,0,6.67,1.3,5.22,0.72,0,0.58,0.14,0.29,0,0.14,13.48,6.52,0.14,0.14,2.46,1.01,3.04,6.38,0,0,0.14,2.32,5.36,2.75,2.17,0.43,2.17,0,0.29,1.59,0.29,0,1.88,0.29,0.14,0,0,0,0,0,1.3,0,0,0.29,0.14,0,0,0,0.43,0,1.3,10.29,0.72,1.88,7.97,0,0.14,0,4.06,5.8,1.45,0.58,0,0,0,0,0,15.8,4.49,5.51,0,0,1.16,4.64

Dmitry Muratov, editor-in-chief of the independent Novaya Gazeta newspaper, accepted the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo on Friday. He and Philippine journalist Maria Ressa received the honor for their commitments to protecting press freedom. Muratov, whose newsroom has had several of its journalists killed in connection with their reporting, dedicated his award to his slain colleagues and decried growing threats to freedom and human rights in Russia and its neighboring countries. Here are the main highlights from his acceptance speech: — “There is a saying in Russian and English and other languages: ‘When the dogs bark, but the caravan keeps walking.’ One explanation is that nothing can hinder the progress of a caravan. The government sometimes derisively says the same about journalists. They bark, but it does not affect anything. But I was recently told that the saying has an opposite explanation. The caravan drives forward because the dogs bark. They growl and savage the predators in the mountains and the desert. The caravan can move forward only with the dogs around. Yes, we growl and bite. Yes, we have sharp teeth and a strong grip. But we are the prerequisite for progress. We are the antidote against tyranny.” — “​​There are two contradicting trends in Russia today. On the one hand, Russia’s president supports the erection of a monument to Sakharov’s 100th anniversary. On the other hand, Russia’s Prosecutor General demands the elimination of the international organization Memorial. ... But Memorial was established by Sakharov. Memorial is not an ‘enemy of the people.’ Memorial is a friend of the people.” — “We hear more and more often about torture of convicts and detainees. … I am now presenting an initiative of setting up an international tribunal against torture, which will have the task to gather information on torture in different parts of the world and different countries, and to identify the executioners and the authorities involved in such crimes. Of course, I shall rely first and foremost on investigative journalists around the world. Torture must be recognized as the most serious crime against humanity.” — “Hybrid warfare and the tragic, ugly and criminal story of the Boeing MH17 have ruined relations between Russia and Ukraine, and I do not know if the next generations will be able to restore them … Moreover, in the heads of some crazy geopoliticians, a war between Russia and Ukraine is not something impossible any longer. But I know that wars end with identifying soldiers and exchanging prisoners.” — “Journalism in Russia is going through a dark valley. Over a hundred journalists, media outlets, human rights defenders and NGOs have recently been branded as ‘foreign agents.’ In Russia, this means ‘enemies of the people.’ Many of our colleagues have lost their jobs. Some have to leave the country.” — “I can probably — as always — get questions like: why did your colleagues go there? Yes, to witness. To prove. To see it with their own eyes. Because as the great war photographer Robert Capa said: ‘If your picture isn’t good enough, you aren’t close enough.’ — “‘Aren’t you afraid?’ is the most common question my colleagues get. But this is their mission. As governments continually improve the past, journalists try to improve the future.” — “Let us rise and honor my and Maria Ressa's reporter colleagues, who have given their lives for this profession, with a minute of silence, and let us give our support to those who suffer persecution. I want journalists to die old.”",1,576,80.15,47.26,49.53,3.61,13.09,26.91,86.63,64.06,51.74,9.03,6.6,1.56,1.56,0.69,0.69,1.56,2.43,17.19,9.72,1.22,12.85,6.94,3.13,7.47,1.39,13.54,6.94,2.95,7.99,2.6,1.91,3.47,11.98,1.22,10.76,2.43,0.69,1.22,1.74,0.87,5.03,0,7.29,2.43,4.69,1.56,0.17,1.22,0.17,0,0.17,0,12.85,5.73,0.35,0,1.91,1.22,1.56,6.94,0,0,0,0.69,1.56,1.39,0.17,0,4.69,0,0.17,4.51,0,0,2.43,0,0,0,0,0,0.17,0,1.22,0.35,0.17,1.04,0,0.52,0,0.35,0.35,0,4.86,9.38,0,1.22,6.42,1.04,0.69,0.17,3.3,2.43,5.21,1.22,0.52,0,0.52,0,0,19.97,8.16,4.51,0.35,0,2.26,4.69

Now that thaw is definitively over. The political crisis that broke out following the contested presidential election of 2020, the European ban on EU aircraft flying over Belarus following the forced landing of a Ryanair plane in May, and Lukashenko’s pro-Russian lurch mean Minsk is no longer an acceptable stage for negotiations. The achievements of five years of an actively multi-vectoral foreign policy by Minsk from 2014 to 2019 have lost value. The bonuses that Belarus earned by distancing itself from Russia have vanished and will not return any time soon, given the extent of the West’s dismay over human rights abuses in Belarus. And if Minsk had continued to pretend to be neutral in the current situation, it would have risked eliciting the ire of Moscow too. Today, Lukashenko is dependent on the Kremlin’s goodwill and deep pockets for two key issues: how peaceful and smooth the rest of his time in power will be, and the future power transition. Minsk’s priority, therefore, is to win Moscow’s benevolence while giving up as little sovereignty as possible in exchange. Lukashenko has decided to go about this using two methods: making strong symbolic gestures on the one hand, such as recognizing Crimea as part of Russia, and dragging Russia even further into its geopolitical standoff with the West on the other. After all, Moscow will be far more willing to open its coffers for a proud bastion standing in the way of Moscow’s enemies than for an ally that is constantly performing a balancing act and which simply wants to live well without bothering to reform its economy. For Lukashenko, therefore, it’s important that his own standoff with the West should be perceived in Moscow not simply as the petty squabbles of a minor Eastern European state, but as part of a major NATO crusade against Russia and its friends. This is why Lukashenko has started resorting to the verbal rattling of Russian sabers, trying to involve Moscow in his own disputes with Belarus’s neighbors amid a series of belligerent, anti-Western statements, such as raising the possibility of returning Russian nuclear weapons to Belarusian territory, twenty-five years after they were removed. There are two possible explanations as to why Lukashenko has spoken out now on Crimea and launched his latest crusade against the West. The first explanation is that negotiations are under way on a new $3 billion loan for Minsk from the Eurasian Development Bank, which is controlled by Moscow. The second is that in a recent speech to senior Foreign Ministry officials, Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly said that Moscow is in favor of a dialogue between the authorities and the opposition in Belarus. Like many analysts, the Belarusian authorities likely interpreted Putin’s advice as a sign of displeasure, which could have been incurred by Minsk’s attempts to turn the drawn-out process of constitutional reform promised to Moscow into a mechanism for extending Lukashenko’s rule under a new title. In any case, it’s not a good idea to upset Russia over anything right now, while loans are being discussed and the West is introducing new sanctions against Belarus, which will require joint efforts by Minsk and Moscow to circumvent. Belarus’s neighbors — Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine — have long viewed the Belarusian authorities as a puppet regime controlled by Russia. Accordingly, the reaction to Lukashenko’s comments on Crimea was fairly muted. The EU and United States paid no heed, occupied instead with passing new sanctions against Minsk for instigating the migrant crisis on Belarus’s borders. There will be consequences for the relationship between Belarus and Ukraine, of course, but a complete breaking off of relations is unlikely. Most probably, Kiev will scale down its representation in Minsk by sending home the Belarusian ambassador and recalling its own. If Lukashenko visits Crimea in violation of Ukrainian law, as he has promised to, new personal sanctions are a possibility, along with trade wars, but Kiev is not prepared to go without its main Belarusian import: petrochemicals. Belarusian refineries send about 40 percent of their petrochemicals (gasoline, diesel, and bitumen) to neighboring Ukraine, which has no potential replacement for them in the foreseeable future. Nor is it likely that the West will impose additional sanctions specifically over Belarus’s recognition of Crimea. Restrictions are imposed over threats to regional stability, such as the forced landing of the Ryanair plane or the situation with the migrants on the Belarusian-Polish border. Against this backdrop, Lukashenko’s rhetoric about Russian territorial disputes with its neighbors pales in comparison. Given that Lukashenko had nothing left to lose in relations with the West and Ukraine, his recognition of Crimea is unlikely to herald a breakthrough in relations with the Kremlin. Support for Russia’s position on Crimea would have been appreciated back when it would have incurred a cost for Minsk. But a friendly gesture made out of despair, when Belarus’s multi-vectoral foreign policy has stopped yielding fruit, smacks of insincerity. In any case, the recognition of Crimea as Russian territory could easily be reversed by a future government eager to distance itself from the previous regime, whose very legitimacy is in doubt. For Moscow, of course, any crisis in the relationship between Minsk and Kiev is a bonus. It reduces the chance of any kind of coordinated action by these two neighbors — both transit countries for Russian gas supplies to Europe — in the future, as well as leaving Minsk with less room to maneuver and decreasing its chances of returning to any kind of multi-vectoral foreign policy. Only time will tell whether this move by Minsk will impact on Moscow’s financial generosity. The Belarusian state is due to pay off $3.4 billion in debts next year, and more than $4 billion in 2023. Taking into account the effect of Western sanctions and the state of Minsk’s foreign currency reserves, new Russian loans are absolutely essential. In September, Putin promised $630 million by the end of 2022. Clearly that won’t be enough, so Lukashenko’s Crimea diplomacy and, more importantly, the Kremlin’s reluctance to drive its ally to default and chaos mean Minsk can likely count on a larger sum. The problem is that Lukashenko will have to provide Moscow with constant reminders of his loyalty, and following his recognition of Crimea, he is running out of options for further rhetorical and symbolic concessions. Going forward, he will either have to sacrifice something sacred like state property or aspects of sovereignty, or escalate affairs with Belarus’s neighbors to such an extent that the Kremlin won’t be able to remain on the sidelines. For now, it looks like Lukashenko is leaning toward the second option, making that the biggest source of risk to the region today.

""The hysteria unrolled in the West on this topic shows, first of all, the jealousy of some European cities and states towards Africa and the Middle East, whose sovereignty and independence they were once forced to recognise,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. It added that Moscow may respond to the ""unfriendly"" move. On Monday, European foreign ministers agreed to slap sanctions on targets linked to Wagner — a secretive company accused of acting to destabilise Ukraine and parts of Africa. They approved a list of eight names and three companies associated with Wagner to be added immediately to existing sanctions regimes. The West says the group works on behalf of the Kremlin in conflict zones. In its statement, the ministry said ""private military companies are not under the control of official Russian authorities."" It added that independent countries — ""assessing their own security capabilities"" — have the right to work with such companies. ""The European Union casts doubt on the sovereign right of these UN member states to build an independent and domestic foreign policy,"" the ministry said. ""Russia reserves the right to respond to the unfriendly actions of the EU,"" it added. Wagner is said to be financed by Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, who has already been hit with EU and U.S. sanctions for destabilising Libya and meddling in US elections. In addition to the Wagner firm and three linked companies, the sanctions list targeted eight individuals, including the group's alleged commander.

",English,Russia,"Did anyone really think a two-hour video conversation between Presidents Putin and Biden was really going to bring a breakthrough? Of course, it didn’t. Nonetheless, it is worth considering just what such a personal connection can and can’t do. Of course, all we know about the conversation, beyond the first few seconds, is from the respective sides’ statements, so it’s simply a question of whose spin you want to believe. Washington’s brief readout struck a minatory tone, saying that Biden “reiterated his support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and called for de-escalation and a return to diplomacy,” and warning that “the U.S. and our Allies would respond with strong economic and other measures in the event of military escalation.” While Putin said the conversation was “very open, substantive, and constructive,” Moscow’s own rather lengthier summary offered — unsurprisingly — a rather different interpretation. It said that while “Biden, in turn, focused on what he described as “threatening” movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border… Putin warned against shifting the responsibility on Russia, since it was NATO that was undertaking dangerous attempts to gain a foothold on Ukrainian territory, and building up its military capabilities along the Russian border.” In particular, it emphasized Moscow’s new big-picture demand: that this crisis be resolved not simply with Kiev’s return to the Minsk process in the ways understood by Russia, but also with steps towards the creation of a new European security architecture, starting with “reliable, legally binding guarantees ruling out the eventuality of NATO’s eastward expansion and the deployment of offensive weapons systems in the countries neighboring Russia.” To some hawks in the West, President Biden’s willingness even to talk to his Russian counterpart was a concession. This is a deeply dangerous contention, as dialogue and diplomacy are precisely at their most valuable with those with whom one disagrees and in times of the greatest tension. A more reasonable criticism is that nothing new came of the conversation. The various sanctions Biden presumably outlined are unlikely to be different from the options already openly discussed, from extending controls on Russian banks’ access to credit markets to finally blocking Nord Stream 2. Likewise, Putin does not seem to have offered any new concessions or potential diplomatic solutions. The Kremlin and its usual mouthpieces have been floating the need for some more comprehensive security deal for some time now, and Russian forces are still building up around Ukraine’s borders. It’s good to talk However, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan affirmed after the event that “there is no substitute for direct dialogue between leaders, and that is true in spades when it comes to the U.S.-Russia relationship” and he is right. It would be a mistake to consider the conversation futile and fruitless. First of all, whatever was said, the simple fact that there was such a conversation matters. The Kremlin has internalized — and not without reason — that it is only really heard by the Americans when it makes a fuss and creates a problem. Putin’s people had been pushing for this contact and had it continued to be denied, there would have been a temptation for them to escalate in some way — though certainly not to the level of major military action — simply to make their case more compelling. Secondly, there is scope for some kind of human rapport. Foreign policy is at once dominated by intractable global processes and also deeply personal. Although there is no prospect of any kind of odd couple affinity as blossomed between Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan, for example, perhaps one of Biden’s only particular strengths appears to be his affability. To the best of my knowledge, no scholar has written specifically on the role of geniality in geopolitics (watch me be proven wrong). However, if he was able to convey not just toughness but also a genuine desire for dialogue — rather than, as the Kremlin sees it, the usual American assumption of automatic righteousness — then this may, in some admittedly very small way, offset the hawkish chorus Putin has installed around himself. Finally, as during the Geneva face-to-face summit, the conversation between presidents unlocks further, quieter, more technical discussions by their specialists. Sullivan noted that the U.S. and its “European allies would engage in a discussion that covers larger strategic issues, including our strategic concerns with Russia and Russia’s strategic concerns” — so long as Russia did not escalate. Putin clearly has some strange and unhealthy notions about Ukraine and the Ukrainian people that preclude them true agency and sovereignty. He is also by no means alone in believing that the West duped Moscow over NATO expansion, hence his likely unachievable desire for cast iron guarantees about what would, in effect, be the enforced ‘Finlandisation’ of Ukraine. At the same time, the nature of haggling is that both parties start with extreme bids, expecting to be negotiated towards the middle. It may well be that the gap is unbridgeable, and in any case this is not simply a deal to be struck between Moscow and Washington — it is not for either of them to dispose of Ukraine’s fate. However, insofar as any diplomatic solution may be achievable, that can only come when both sides talk.",1,868,71.71,31.68,32.08,26.24,28,29.84,82.95,65.55,53.69,7.95,2.65,0.23,0.35,0.12,1.04,0.69,5.3,15.55,7.37,0.81,15.32,7.83,7.03,7.14,1.73,12.9,8.18,3.23,5.18,1.04,1.38,2.76,14.86,0.69,13.94,2.53,1.38,1.5,2.53,2.42,4.03,0,4.15,2.19,1.73,0.46,0.12,0.12,0,0.12,0,0,9.68,5.65,0.81,0.23,0.46,0.35,3.57,4.03,0,0,0,1.04,3.8,2.42,1.27,0.12,1.96,0.12,0.12,1.27,0.58,0,0.35,0.23,0,0,0.12,0,0,0,0,0.35,0.46,0.12,0.12,0,0,0.12,1.04,0.46,3.34,8.87,0.46,1.38,6.91,0.35,0.23,0.12,3,3.92,4.03,1.04,0,0,0,0,0,15.67,4.49,5.88,0.12,0,2.19,3

Russian respondents’ approval of the president’s job performance dropped to 63% in November from 67% in October, according to the Levada Center pollster. Putin ordered a nationwide partial lockdown from Oct. 30-Nov. 7 in a bid to slow the virus’ spread after placing most Covid-19 response decisions in the hands of regional leaders for much of the pandemic. According to Levada, 57% of its respondents approved of their regional leaders in November, while 38% did not. Putin’s approval has yet to return to the highs it enjoyed following Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, as unpopular pension reforms and lagging living standards have fueled public discontent. While he has repeatedly urged Russians to get vaccinated with one of the country's Covid-19 vaccines amid widespread vaccine hesitancy, Putin still opposes the idea of mandatory vaccination. Key Putin allies who typically maintain relative popularity also saw their approval ratings drop from October to November, with Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin’s indicators both falling by 2%. Nearly half of respondents, 46%, said Russia is moving in the right direction. A slightly smaller share, 44%, expressed the opposite opinion, Levada said.

Spy Plane Nearly Caused Mid - Air  Catastrophe  ",English,Russia,"Moscow has said that a U.S. plane threatened civilian aircraft but ""catastrophe"" was avoided when a Russian passenger plane dived to avoid the NATO reconnaissance aircraft that crossed its path above the Black Sea. On Friday morning a NATO CL600 reconnaissance aircraft descended rapidly across the planned route for a Tel Aviv to Moscow Aeroflot service with 142 people on board, Russia's Federal Air Transport Agency said in a statement. The Aeroflot flight reportedly had to drop 500 meters (1,600 feet) to keep its distance from the reconnaissance aircraft, which the pilots saw from the cockpit with the naked eye. A second plane, a smaller CL650 aircraft, flying from the Black Sea resort Sochi to Skopje, the capital of Northern Macedonia, also had to divert to avoid the spy plane, the Russian air transport authority said Saturday. ""The direction and altitude of the commercial flights were immediately altered"" to avoid a collision, the agency said, adding that the unknown plane did not respond to radio hails from air traffic control. While the Federal Air Transport Agency did not say which nation had operated the spy plane, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova indicated on Sunday that the reconnaissance aircraft belonged to the United States. ""The actions of the U.S. Air Force have created a threat to civil aviation,"" Zakharova said on messaging app Telegram. ""If now a catastrophe in the airspace over the open waters of the Black Sea has been averted, this does not mean that the United States and NATO can continue to risk people's lives with impunity."" The Federal Air Transport Agency said it would lodge a diplomatic protest. ""Increased activity by NATO aircraft near Russia's borders, including above the Black Sea, creates a risk of dangerous accidents involving civilian aircraft,"" the agency said.

Russia’s Foreign Ministry passed the offer to U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Karen Donfried, who is in Moscow after visiting Kiev amid fears of Russia invading Ukraine. Putin reiterated his request to “immediately launch negotiations” with the U.S. and NATO on international legal guarantees for Russia’s security. Putin previously informed his Finnish counterpart of the offer. “The president expressed hope that the Americans and NATO members will respond positively to this,” Interfax quoted Putin’s senior foreign policy aide Yury Ushakov as saying. Putin’s demands include stopping NATO from expanding east, including closing Ukraine's door to membership, and halting its deployment of weapons in neighboring states. Ushakov said Putin informed Chinese President Xi Jinping of the U.S. and NATO security guarantee proposal during virtual talks Wednesday. “The Chinese president stressed that he […] fully supports our initiative to develop appropriate security guarantees for Russia,” Interfax quoted him as saying. Putin’s aide added that the Russian leader agreed to keep Xi informed “about how negotiations develop on this matter with American and NATO partners.” Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov has previously warned that Moscow could act militarily if the talks it demands do not materialize. U.S. President Joe Biden last week warned Putin of ""sanctions like he's never seen"" should the Russian troops massed on the Ukrainian border launch an attack.

The comments, reported by state-run news agency RIA Novosti Sunday, were excerpts from an upcoming film by broadcaster Channel One, dubbed ""Russia. Recent History."" ""After all, what is the collapse of the Soviet Union? This is the collapse of historical Russia under the name of the Soviet Union,"" the Russian leader was cited as saying. A loyal servant of the Soviet Union, Putin was dismayed when it fell apart, once calling the collapse ""the greatest geopolitical disaster of the 20th century."" Putin is sensitive to the perceived expansion of Western military ambitions into ex-Soviet countries and Russia this week demanded that NATO formally scrap a 2008 decision to open its door to Georgia and Ukraine. The end of the Union brought with it a period of intense economic instability that plunged many into poverty, as newly independent Russia transitioned from communism to capitalism. RIA Novosti, reporting from excerpts of the documentary, said Putin had revealed that he worked occasionally as a taxi driver to boost his income. ""Sometimes I had to earn extra money,"" Putin said.

The Dec. 1-3 drills along the Strait of Malacca on the northeastern coast of Sumatra involve all 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Russia dispatched the large anti-submarine ship Admiral Panteleev for the marine phase of the two-part virtual and marine exercises. Agence France Presse reported that these were the first ever joint Russian-ASEAN naval exercises. According to the state-run TASS news agency, Rear Adm. Abdul Rasyid, the Indonesian Navy’s commander of the first fleet, said the maneuvers will “strengthen friendship” and “interaction and mutual understanding” between Russia and ASEAN. “These exercises are about peace, stability and prosperity in the region,” said Russia’s ambassador to ASEAN Alexander Ivanov. “We’re opening a new page in our strategic partnership,” added Ivanov, who attended the opening ceremony with Russia’s Ambassador to Indonesia Lyudmila Vorobyova. The Russian-ASEAN exercises are taking place against the backdrop of the Southeast Asian states’ growing tensions with China around its claim of the entire South China Sea. Russia has been forging closer ties with China since its relations with Western nations soured after it annexed Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula and is being accused of backing pro-Moscow rebels in the country’s southeast. In addition to Indonesia, the bloc comprises Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia, Myanmar and Brunei. The countries provided warships or aircraft, AFP reported, while the Philippines took part as a virtual observer.

S . ",English,Russia,"The United States on Saturday urged Russia to pull back from the brink over Ukraine, warning that the G7 and its allies will impose tough measures if it abandons diplomacy. A senior State Department official told reporters at a meeting of the grouping's top diplomats in Liverpool, northwest England, that Moscow still had time to change course. ""But if they choose not to pursue that path, there will be massive consequences and severe costs in response, and the G7 is absolutely united in that,"" the official said. ""A large number of democratic countries will join us in imposing costs,"" they added. The warning came as Russian sabre-rattling against Ukraine and how to counter an increasingly assertive China dominated the first day of a two-day meeting of G7 foreign ministers in the British city. The meeting — at which ministers want to present a united front against authoritarianism — is the last in-person gathering of Britain's year-long G7 presidency, before it hands the baton to Germany. Opening the talks, Britain's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told delegates: ""We need to come together strongly to stand up to aggressors who are seeking to limit the bounds of freedom and democracy. ""To do this, we need to have a fully united voice. We need to expand our economic and security posture around the world."" Truss, in the job since September, set out her foreign policy vision in a major address on Wednesday, echoing U.S. threats of unprecedented sanctions if Russia invades Ukraine. Western concerns are growing over a Russian troop build-up on the border that the Kremlin says is defensive against any move by the former Soviet state eastwards towards NATO. G7 ministers want to show the grouping can move beyond condemnation to robustly defend its values as a deterrent to future threats. The meeting comes after U.S. President Joe Biden this week held a virtual summit with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to try to end the stand-off diplomatically.

Merkel was a proponent of direct talks with Putin and her ambivalent stance on Russia also frequently alienated partners, particularly in eastern Europe. She angered them especially with the controversial Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline set to carry Russian gas to Germany, which several eastern European countries believe will embolden Moscow at their expense.

135,themoscowtimes.com,1639555200,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/12/15/russias-third-cold-war-a75822,Russia Third Cold War - The Moscow Times,English,Russia,"While discussions abound on the internet concerning the results of the recent talks between President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Joe Biden — and with most suggesting that the Kremlin once again “outmaneuvered” his opponent by forcing the White House to assure the world of its adherence to the so-called Minsk Agreements and agree to freeze military aid to Ukraine — I would like to note that Russia has already effectively entered into a new Cold War with the West: a conflict that resembles not only the major Cold War of 1947-1986, but also the minor one of 1830-1856. A number of parallels exist between today’s events and those of the past. In each instance, Russia acted from a position of imagined moral superiority. Almost 200 years ago, it stood for “preserving the foundation” and conserving monarchical orders in Europe, defending that system from all manner of “nihilists.” After World War II, it spoke of the triumph of communism as the most progressive social system. Now, the Kremlin is repeating the idea that Russia stands in opposition to the pernicious and immoral West, that it is once again the defender of traditional values which the West is liable to desecrate. And each time, the confrontation began when Russia “bullied” Western proxies. In the first Cold War, this involved Russia’s suppression of the uprising in Poland in 1830, the revolution in Hungary in 1848 and the ultimatum in 1853 that Turkey grant a protectorate over its dominions inhabited primarily by Russian Orthodox. The second, larger Cold War began with the Soviet satellite states refusing to participate in the Marshall Plan and blockading West Berlin in 1947. Most recently, tensions escalated when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and undermined Ukraine’s territorial integrity through military intervention in Donbass in 2014-2015. And each time, events did not escalate into a “hot” or direct shooting war. Instead, the conflicts were limited to a peripheral theater of operations — such as the Crimean campaign of the 1850s; played out wherever in the world the interests of the warring parties clashed — as happened in the second half of the 20th century; or, as is happening now, boil down to the activities of quasi-military formations over which one side claims it has no control — and various types of terrorist actions. We shouldn’t forget that each time, Russia or the Soviet Union lacked the economic and technological might that would have given it the upper hand in the ensuing confrontation. Although Moscow has had the capability to wipe its enemy off the face of the earth ever since it developed nuclear weapons in the mid-20th century, it would have also been blown to smithereens in the process, with the result that it was unable to win any of these “cold wars,” and each of its defeats ended in a serious crisis of the entire social model of both the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union. However obvious these parallels might appear, Russia has made the same mistakes every time. First, it has earned a reputation in Europe and the West as an “evil empire” — if not through openly hostile actions, then through domestic policies and ideological aspirations — with which cooperation was, by definition, considered impossible. Second, in each of these “cold wars,” Russia found itself either alone or supported by only strategically insignificant satellite states, while it was opposed by an alliance of powerful and influential countries, thus foreordaining a pitiable outcome to the struggle. Third, this country reacted to each “cold war” by tightening the screws on its domestic policy, reducing freedoms and leading society into a kind of stupor that only ended when the federal authorities lost power during a subsequent episode of the confrontation with the West. Fourth — and this partly follows from the third point — as the conflict deepened, the Russian authorities increasingly lost touch with reality, leading them to make the mistakes that “broke the camel’s back” — the occupation of Moldova and Wallachia in 1853 and Afghanistan in 1979. In my opinion, we cannot separate what is happening now from the previous “cold wars” or the obvious lessons to be learned from them. Russia has repeatedly behaved impatiently and aggressively, while the West — that many Russian liberals now accuse of defeatism and conciliation — initially perceived those confrontations with St. Petersburg and Moscow as a long process in which their developing societies would inevitably prevail over the stagnant Russian or Soviet ones.

Held at Gostiny Dvor Dec. 2-6, it offers fiction, non-fiction, and pop science literature from 18 countries (including Israel, China, U.K., U.S, Ukraine, France and Japan); from 300 major publishing houses; with more than 500 special events and talks by authors and publishers from around the world; for upwards of 40,000 visitors every year, some of whom are also budding authors who sign contracts right on the spot. If you love books, you must go to this book fair. This year the special guest country is Germany, which means lots of books, authors, films, talks and other events in German and from Germany. There is a big section of kid’s books, one for comics and graphic novels, and a growing section of cookbooks.  Buy your ticket(s) ahead of time, dust off your book bags, take a look at the program of talks, demonstrations, and seminars, and plan your weekend. There are plenty of foreign language books and lots of foreign authors despite the coronavirus and other travel restrictions. More information in Russian and English and ticket purchases on the site here. The holiday season might be subdued this year in Moscow — like last year, there will be no fairs or activities in the city center — but that doesn’t mean you’ll have to sit home watching “It’s a Wonderful Life” on Netflix. On Dec. 24 you might want to experience the brilliance and triumph of Dmitry Shostakovich’s “Seventh Symphony,” also called the “Leningrad Symphony.” It will be performed on the main stage of the Zaryadye Concert Hall by the Russian State Orchestra, directed by Vasily Petrenko.  And on Dec. 25 at 1 p.m. the Cantus Boy’s Choir is performing a Christmas concert on the small stage. The choir is one of the finest in Russia, dedicated to the long tradition of church choral music in Russia. The program will be Russian and European Christmas music, although it ends of the very festive and light notes of “Jingle Bells” and “Jingle Bell Rock.” For more information and tickets, see the concert hall site. In many parts of the world, there is nothing that says “holidays” more than teddy bears. In some families children get new bears every year. In others, the parents do, too. Whether or not this is a tradition in your family, the Hello, Teddy exhibition will put you and your children in a bearish good mood. At Tishinka mall you can see 50,000 teddy bears, from some so small you can only see them under a microscope, to some so big you couldn’t pick them up. The stuffed bears have their friends on display, too: rabbits, badgers, foxes,  mice and other forest creatures. For more information and tickets, see the site here. This year on the first day of Hanukah, the Jewish Museum and Tolerance Center opened a very hands-on exhibition called Becoming Jewish. With artifacts — some quite rare — from private and public collections in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other parts of Russia, children are introduced to the traditions, holidays and games that once were part of most Jewish children’s lives in this part of the world. The curators worked on the exhibition for two years, designing it as one grand board game that will grab children’s interest and teach them while letting them be entertained. The show will run for four months until Purim. While you’re there, be sure to see the show “Snow on Grass” of works by the great animator Yuri Norshtein and the artist Francesca Norbusova. For more information about the show, see the site here. Maybe to compensate for the pandemic cancellations of holiday fairs and activities, maybe to make up for the cold slush and snow, or maybe just because Muscovites love jazz, there is something of a world-wide jazz festival this month. Tonight, Dec. 3 at 8 p.m., the Italian jazz band Conosci mia cugina has flown in from Rome to perform at Artnovi Space. Think swing. Tickets are 2,000 rubles and available here. If Italy isn’t hot enough for you, how about Brazil? On Sunday evening at 7:30 p.m. the rooftop restaurant-club Krym is hosting a Russian jazz group that has made the Bosa Nova their own.

The unlikely artist is Viktor Bout, also known as the “merchant of death,” a former Russian arms dealer serving a 25-year sentence in a U.S. jail who was the inspiration for the 2005 Hollywood movie ""Lord of War"" starring Nicolas Cage. “We held the exhibition to show that Viktor still has the will to go on, despite his difficult situation,” said Bout’s wife Alla, who runs the Road to Home foundation which lobbies for her husband’s release. Alla also said she hoped the exhibition would keep her husband in the news. “It is also important to remind people that he is still in jail, a lot of time has passed since he was first arrested,” she added. Bout, a former army lieutenant, has so far spent 11 years in an American prison after his 2008 arrest in Thailand in an elaborate sting operation, during which U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents posed as Colombian Marxist rebels seeking to buy an arsenal of modern weapons. Throughout his incarceration, Bout has been linked repeatedly with prisoner swaps involving Americans jailed in Russia. Most recently, reports have emerged that Bout could be exchanged for Paul Whelan, a former security official at an auto parts company who was arrested in December 2018 on charges of espionage, or Trevor Reed, who was arrested in 2019 for a brawl in which he punched two Russian police officers. However, as the threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine has become a global talking point over the last month, it’s unlikely the topic of prisoner exchange will be raised during Tuesday’s high-stakes virtual summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his U.S. counterpart Joe Biden. U.S. prosecutors have alleged that Bout's weapons fueled armed conflicts in some of the world's bloodiest hot spots, including Rwanda, Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Bout has always insisted he was a legitimate businessman. The Moscow exhibition includes 24 of Bout’s portraits, landscapes and still lives — including a number of self portraits behind bars featuring his signature mustache. The works are in pencil, ballpoint pen, pastels, wax crayons and oil paints provided by the United States Penitentiary in Marion. Alla Bout said each drawing “had a very difficult path to Russia,” having been flown into the country by Russian diplomatic staff. “Viktor would send the drawings to the Russian embassy in Washington and our diplomats would take one of the pieces every time they flew home on holiday,” she said. The exhibition opened on Monday, with a number of government-linked guests in attendance, including Maria Butina, the high-profile gun rights activist who spent 15 months in U.S. prison after admitting to working as an unregistered Russian agent. Butina, who returned to Russia in October 2019 and now has a seat in Russia’s parliament, has been one of Bout’s most vocal supporters. “When I saw the painting I felt the pain Bout is going through. Pain that made me feel I am still behind bars too,” Butina, who runs a foundation supporting Russians jailed abroad, told The Moscow Times by phone. Moscow has regularly slammed Bout’s case as political, pointing to statements made by U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin — who presided over Bout’s case in Manhattan — in an interview with The New York Times in which she said she believed the sentence was “excessive and inappropriate.” “I really hope America will agree to exchange prisoners, including Bout, so that he and others can spend time with his family during Christmas. That would help restore relations that are currently at a low point,” Butina said, adding that she wasn’t expecting the topic to be raised today. Bout’s lawyer Alexei Tarasov said on Monday there has been no progress on the issue of his exchange. “I don’t see any indications that my clients will be discussed at the talks,” the lawyer told the Russian state news agency TASS.

Kennedy who first popularized the saying, “Victory has 100 fathers, but defeat is an orphan”, they like repeating it so much that one might say it has now become part of the Russian culture. However, this adage doesn’t seem to apply to the mass protests for fair elections in 2011-2012 because, although everyone admits that those demonstrations ended in defeat, many people are still vying to be considered the father of that defeat. For the first time in modern Russian history, tens of thousands of indignant citizens took to the streets of Moscow and other large Russian cities and, over many months, peacefully but persistently demanded respect for their rights. One year later, that wave of civic enthusiasm gave way to despondency as the authorities responded with criminal cases and police violence, a crackdown on freedoms, media owners who had indirectly supported the protests replaced with Kremlin loyalists, and public figures who had delivered speeches at the rallies subjected to coordinated harassment. Several non-conformist deputies of the State Duma — the same Duma that had been elected with the help of falsified results — were even forced to leave the country. For all of the next 10 years, we have witnessed the Kremlin’s reaction to the sudden humiliation it suffered back then. The increasingly repressive measures, the spate of criminal cases, the new laws against “foreign agents”, proxy wars and state television’s ever more toxic propaganda — all this is a consequence of those peaceful rallies. And if Russian leaders consider the rally on Bolotnaya Square on Dec. 10, 2011 as “ground zero” in this battle, then they see the country’s intelligentsia as the masterminds behind the attack on their authority and have pushed to alienate it from the state ever since. The Kremlin propaganda machine has waged a war against the intelligentsia, portraying it as the driving force behind the protests, as funded by the West, as pro-gay and pro-Ukraine — in short, as pro-everything that ordinary working Russians oppose. That is why, when the anniversary of those events rolls around every December, all the numerous “fathers” of that defeat among the Russian intelligentsia (yours truly included) engage in painful reflection on the question of what we did wrong. Setting aside the somewhat hackneyed remark that painful reflection has been a hereditary trait of the Russian intelligentsia since the time of Chekhov’s plays, let us ask a better question instead: Is there an error in this logic? When we ask, “Why did the Russian opposition lose in 2011?” we ipso facto assume that it could have won had it made different decisions. Among the alternate scenarios must often cited are if protesters had held an unsanctioned rally outside the Kremlin walls in place of the sanctioned gathering it did hold on Bolotnaya Square — on a strategically inconvenient island in the middle of the Moscow River — and if opposition leaders had not left town over the long New Year’s holiday. But just for a change, maybe we should ask whether protesters ever had any chance at all of winning. It now increasingly appears that they did not. That possibility simply didn’t exist because Russian society was completely different 10 years ago. In 2009-2010, the largest rallies in Russia had brought together only 100-200 people — not counting a riot by violent nationalist football fans. What’s more, the great majority of people had no experience  whatever of political action — with the possible exception of older citizens who had attended rallies during the collapse of the Soviet Union — and protest organizers had no experience providing legal assistance to detainees and financial assistance to individuals and organizations subjected to repression. For today’s 20-year-olds in Russia, sending a donation of even a few dollars a month to help keep persecuted media outlets stay afloat and attending an unsanctioned rally is as natural as brushing your teeth. Ten years ago, this was all new. At that time, civil society was just emerging in Russia. It was in its infancy, naive and overly optimistic. Don’t let your eyes fool you, though. To a casual observer, it seems that little has changed between the Russia of 2011 and that of today. After all, opposition leader Alexei Navalny is behind bars, his organization has been disbanded, all independent media outlets have been branded with the onerous label of foreign agent and, once again, it seems that no one is stirring and all is quiet on the protest front. This is not the case, however. There is a huge difference in today’s society. Ten years ago, politics was not even on the agenda. Yes, many thousands of people took to the streets, but they did so with an underlying complacency. Now, politics is front and center. The fact that citizens’ political demands have been strangled and shoved under the carpet so as not to be an eyesore has only made people angrier. Just imagine: in every major Russian city, there are now thousands of people with experience in direct political action, solidarity, donating to a cause and signing petitions. And if to include their friends, relatives and co-workers in the ranks of these “reserves”, the number is even larger. But most importantly, Russia has accumulated a great deal of emotional baggage, a sort of collective grievance with the authorities. Yes, the Bolotnaya rallies failed. But they couldn’t have succeeded anyway because they were only the starting point. They served as the trigger for two things: the Kremlin’s aggressively repressive policy, but also as a kind of “civil society university”, an impulse to instruct countless members of the intelligentsia and middle class in the ways of political action. It’s like the “thesis and antithesis” of Hegel’s philosophy. And no one knows what the ultimate “synthesis” will be.",1,964,80.78,44.98,42.76,17.81,22.95,27.28,87.24,65.56,52.49,7.88,2.59,0,0.62,0.41,0.1,1.04,5.29,17.22,9.44,2.39,14.11,7.37,4.88,7.05,1.45,12.03,7.99,5.91,7.99,1.76,1.04,5.29,12.45,2.28,9.96,2.07,1.97,0.41,2.28,0.41,3.94,0,6.33,3.01,3.22,1.35,0.21,1.04,0,0.41,0.1,0,10.48,4.88,0.93,0,1.87,0.41,1.87,5.19,0.41,0.1,0,0.41,3.22,1.76,1.24,0.21,2.9,0.62,0.1,1.45,0.62,0.1,0.73,0.41,0.21,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0.1,0,0.52,0,0,0,0.52,0.41,0.21,4.46,7.78,0,1.14,5.6,0.73,0.1,0.21,4.88,5.81,3.73,0.21,0.21,0,0.21,0,0,15.46,4.36,5.81,0.21,0,1.66,3.42

Putin skipped both the G20 and COP26 and an expected trip to China was rescheduled due to Covid, yet the Russian leader has decided to travel to New Delhi. This step is hopefully more than mere symbolism in the traditionally warm Russo-Indian relations and not simply a signal that at a time of increasingly tense relations with the West, Russia has important friends elsewhere in the world. Still, even if Russia’s relations with India are good, in order for them to become great, a major effort is needed. The July 2021 edition of Russia’s National Security Strategy describes relations with New Delhi as a “special privileged strategic partnership,” and discusses them in the same paragraph as Russo-Chinese ties. The personal chemistry between Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is excellent. Recently, Modi has demonstrated India’s interest in economic projects in Russia’s Far East, thus extending New Delhi’s Look East policy all the way to Vladivostok. Over Washington’s objections, India has gone ahead with the purchase of Russian-made S-400 air defense systems, due to be delivered before the end of the year. Modi is also one of only four foreign leaders to have been awarded Russia’s top decoration, the Order of St. Andrew. Ordinary Russians see India as a reliably friendly country with which their own nation has a virtually problem-free relationship. For their part, most Indians regard Russia as a proven friend that in the course of India’s seventy-five years of independence has never caused their country strategic harm. Yet issues are piling up on many fronts, requiring both the Indian and Russian leaderships to rethink, adjust, and upgrade the relationship to make it fit for the twenty-first century environment. In global geopolitical terms, the main issue is that Moscow and New Delhi, traditional friends and longtime allies, now find themselves ever more closely linked to two rival superpowers, China and the United States. Moreover, India’s relations with China following the 2020 border clashes in the Himalayas, and Russia’s with the United States since the 2014 Ukraine crisis, can be described as confrontation. Thus, in a situation when their best friends are bonding with their worst enemies, the main task for both New Delhi and Moscow is to shield the Indo-Russian strategic partnership from the wider and increasingly adverse global context, and uphold mutual trust. In geoeconomic terms, despite ongoing cooperation in areas ranging from nuclear energy to outer space to the Arctic, not to mention armaments development and production, the obvious weakness of the Indo-Russian relationship is its small and stagnant trade volumes. With America and China — despite the bad political relationship with the latter — India, a fast-rising economy, trades to the tune of $100 billion each, while commerce with Russia still languishes around a mere $10 billion. The reason is again plain to see: While 85% of India’s economy is now in private hands, Indo-Russian economic ties still rest on government-to-government agreements. After the old model of Soviet-Indian economic relations collapsed in 1991, trade volumes plummeted. The U.S.S.R. used to be among India’s top three economic partners; the Russian Federation’s current rank is in the twentieth to twenty-fifth range. Still, Russia remains strong in some important niches, above all military-technical cooperation. Since India’s first purchase of Mig-21 fighters back in 1962, arms trade has been the cornerstone of bilateral relations. Yet India’s growing desire to diversify its arms imports and, recently, its clear intention to develop and produce weapons systems itself, have led to a slump in Russia’s share of the Indian arms market. As a result, Russia’s share of that market has shrunk to just under 50%. There is ever stronger competition from Europe and even more so from the United States. For all their professed pivot to Asia, the current Russian elites remain Eurocentric to the core, and have little time for India. Russia’s government-owned corporations and private business actors find it much easier and more profitable to do business with China than with India. Russian media outlets have little presence in India and do a mediocre job of explaining Indian politics and policies to their audiences. The Russian public has very limited knowledge and understanding of what is going on in India. Tourism and cultural contacts have been picking up in recent years, but the pandemic has severely limited them. An effort to revive the practice of inviting Indian students to study at Russian universities, after an initially promising start, has also suffered from Covid-related restrictions. Ironically, India’s elites are also Western-centric, but unlike Russia’s, they are also Western-leaning, and particularly focused on the United States. Their ambition is to become part of the global elite. To them, Russia is not a priority, and interest in it is scant. The Indian media has virtually no correspondents based in Russia. To cover Russia-related issues, Indian media editors usually rely on Western — mostly American and British — reporting and analysis, which is highly critical of Russian policies. Tellingly, India’s vibrant technology sector has very few contacts with Russia and Russians. All these problems are too big to be resolved in a single and short presidential visit. However, they must not be ignored if the Indo-Russian strategic partnership is to live up to its name in the decade ahead. The Russians need to step back and decide what it is they want from the Indian connection, what the opportunities for and obstacles to this desired state of relations are, and what must be done in order to achieve their objectives. From this perspective, three actions are of central importance for Russia as it proceeds along this path: to rethink, to adjust, and to upgrade. Rethink means, above all, seeing India for what it is and where it is headed. Far too many in Russian elite circles still regard India as the third world country that it was during the heyday of Soviet-Indian friendship in the 1960s–1980s. Those people have clearly missed India’s stunning economic and technological success of the past three decades. As a result, Russia should not expect its large neighbor in Eurasia to act as a non-aligned inward-looking nation, keeping a low profile in international relations and behaving like a middle power. Instead, Russians should acknowledge India’s new status and self-image as a great power, its focus on rapid economic development, and its ambition to become a global economic powerhouse and a leader in modern technologies. They need to understand the fundamental reasons behind India’s growing closeness with the United States, and its increasing hostility with China. Thus, a rethink requires a much closer study of modern India, and a deeper understanding of that vast and highly complex nation, which is rising to the level of a world power. This can be achieved by supporting Indian and South Asian studies in Russia; expanding media coverage of Indian political, economic, and diplomatic developments; and promoting scientific, educational, and cultural ties, as well as tourism and other people-to-people connections. Adjust means factoring in all these realities in developing Russia’s own strategy toward India: something that does not currently exist. It is clear that cultivating and developing the strategic partnership should remain the overall objective of this yet-to-be-devised strategy. However, the partnership should be structured and styled as one of equals, with Moscow dropping all residual vestiges of its previously sometimes patronizing attitudes to its Indian counterparts. On the conceptual level, Russia needs to take a second look at New Delhi’s Indo-Pacific strategy. An in-depth strategic dialogue with New Delhi on that subject could dispel Moscow’s presently negative and suspicious attitude to the strategy. The Russians need to accept that New Delhi’s ideas have different sources and objectives than Washington’s similarly titled strategy. Essentially, India’s new strategy is a logical continuation of its Look East policy. By the same token, Moscow could increase mutual trust with New Delhi by working through and patiently dispelling Indian concerns regarding Russia’s strategic ties with China and its situational cooperation with Pakistan. These clarifying discussions could pave the way to engaging New Delhi in a strategic dialogue on Greater Eurasia, which is the strategic framework for Moscow’s approach. One might consider amplifying Russia’s traditionally continental geopolitical concept by adding a maritime element covering the seas and oceans washing Eurasia. For the purposes of a geopolitical dialogue with India, the relevant areas could include the Arctic, the Pacific, and the Indian Ocean — all the way from Murmansk to Mumbai. By the same token, India’s strategy, which so far has been couched predominantly in maritime terms, might get a continental dimension, starting with Afghanistan, Central Asia, and Iran. Creating synergies between Moscow and New Delhi’s strategies in both domains could be a tantalizing proposition. On this basis, Moscow needs to engage more closely with New Delhi as it further fleshes out the idea of a Greater Eurasian partnership. Maintaining strategic partnerships with both India and China at bilateral and trilateral (RIC) levels is crucial for general geopolitical stability in Eurasia. Russia, which has neither the ambition nor the resources to dominate Greater Eurasia, could play a key role in maintaining Eurasian equilibrium, which requires Russo-Indo-Chinese understanding. While being realistic about its partners and their complicated relations, Russia needs to proactively facilitate efforts at better understanding between New Delhi and Beijing, and promote positive interaction among the three great powers. Such interaction is also needed for engagement with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), a key aspect of the Greater Eurasian Partnership. It is even more necessary for building up the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) as a continent-wide dialogue platform. Moreover, close relations with New Delhi would help Moscow in engaging pragmatically on Eurasian/Indo-Pacific issues with Washington and Tokyo, which are linked with New Delhi through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue. Much as India finds Russia’s partnership with China useful for managing its own relations with Beijing, Moscow could use its close relations with New Delhi to weigh in diplomatically on the Indo-Pacific agenda. India, which is genuinely interested in an improved relationship between Russia and the United States, might be useful here. At the global level, Russia would benefit from closer interaction with India not only within the BRICS, but also at the United Nations. On a number of regional issues, from Afghanistan to the Persian Gulf and the broader Middle East, India needs to be treated as Russia’s privileged interlocutor and partner. Sidelining New Delhi, as has occasionally happened in discussions on Afghanistan, should never happen again. New global issues, from the spread of pandemics to climate change and energy transition, open up broad new areas for Russia-India cooperation, even as they require the careful management of differences. Engaging early with each other would favor cooperative elements over competitive ones and make it possible to chart a coordinated approach to what have become vital issues for the world community. Upgrade means elevating Russia’s relations with India to the level of its other strategic partnership: with China. This does not mean that Moscow-New Delhi ties must resemble Moscow-Beijing ones. The two relationships are very different, as is the wider context in which they operate. The idea is above all to explore and exploit economic opportunities, without which relations with India will always lag behind those with China. There have been many attempts to expand Indo-Russian economic ties, but progress in that direction has been painfully slow. Most of these efforts have followed the well-trodden path of government-to-government contracts, which is not to be abandoned. One opportunity at hand that is truly unique is deepening military-technical cooperation. For decades, Russia has been the leading provider of weapons systems for the Indian military. For its part, India is serious in pressing ahead with the Make in India model. It also has much more to offer in terms of advanced technology, particularly in the information sphere. There have been several examples of successful Russo-Indian weapons development and production, like the BrahMos missile. Compared to other weapons producers, Russia is more flexible in engaging collaboratively with others. This is probably the way to go. One has to be realistic. The Indian and Russian economies remain far less complementary than those of China and Russia. The Russian and Indian business communities are largely disinterested in each other’s countries, where they see few opportunities for themselves. This can only be changed by a joint effort in creative thinking. At their upcoming meeting, President Putin and Prime Minister Modi need to stimulate such an effort by ordering an in-depth study of potential areas of cooperation to be conducted in time for their next annual get-together.

Apparently Not,English,Russia,"At dinner at the American ambassador’s residence in Moscow some years ago, I asked a former senior foreign policy official if anyone in the Kremlin understood Ukraine.  He replied that someone there understood Ukraine very well.  He then added “but nobody listens to him.” The abject failure of Russian policy toward Ukraine over the past seven years suggests the Kremlin and Vladimir Putin have a flawed understanding of the country. On Dec. 17, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, “Have we [Russia] lost Ukraine as a partner, ally and so on?  At this point, yes, completely.” The Russian leadership presumably did not intend this.  Thus, the question of whether the Kremlin and Putin understand Ukraine.  Many signs suggest that they do not. Putin’s last visit to Kiev occurred in 2013, when he traveled to mark the 1025th anniversary of Kievan Rus’s acceptance of Christianity. In a speech Putin said, “We are all spiritual heirs of what happened here 1025 years ago.  And in this sense we [Ukrainians and Russians] are, without a doubt, one people.” What an utterly tone-deaf statement to make in Ukraine.  Millions of ethnic Ukrainians heard it as a denial of their culture, history and language.  Putin has since often repeated that point. Russia’s use of military force to seize Crimea following the Maidan Revolution could hardly be expected to win over Ukrainian sympathies.  Nor would sparking and sustaining a conflict in Donbas that has now claimed more than 13,000 lives. Shortly after the Russia-Ukraine conflict began in 2014, Putin and other Russians started speaking of “Novorossiya” — the idea that much of eastern and southern Ukraine would rise in revolt against Kiev.  The allure of Novorossiya held sway in Moscow long after it became clear that there was little enthusiasm among Ukrainians for breaking away. Volodymyr Zelenskiy won the Ukrainian presidency in 2019.  He came to office a political novice who comfortably spoke Russian and promised a different approach from that of his predecessor, whom Moscow despised.  Zelensky endorsed the Minsk agreements as the basis for resolving the Donbas conflict and spoke approvingly of the “Steinmeier formula” for moving forward—politically risky steps for the new president given growing frustration and anger in Ukraine about the failure of the Minsk agreements to deliver peace in Donbas. What did that get Zelensky?  Putin agreed to a meeting in December 2019 with the Ukrainian leader, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron.  The meeting produced agreement on a prisoner exchange, a full ceasefire in Donbass and a follow-up meeting in spring 2020.  Only the prisoner exchange occurred. Rather than seek compromise, the Kremlin leaders seemed to calculate that they could force the newcomer to make humiliating concessions. Moscow increasingly took the position that it was not a party to the conflict — despite a Russian signature to the Minsk II agreement — and sought to force Kiev to deal directly with the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk “people’s republics.”  The Kremlin now swats away any request by Zelensky to meet Putin. The unsurprising result:  Zelenskiy’s attitude toward Moscow has hardened.  While he brought to office an ambivalent view of the Ukraine-NATO relationship, he now publicly calls for an early membership path for Ukraine. Kremlin policy has driven Ukraine away.  More than anything else, it has persuaded the Ukrainian government and an increasingly large segment of the Ukrainian population that they can find security and stability only if their country is anchored in institutions such as the European Union and NATO.  The Kremlin appears intent on continuing this course.  Putin released an essay in July in which he all but denied Ukraine’s right to exist as a sovereign nation.  In October, former President Dmitry Medvedev termed talking to Kiev “pointless.” The Russian military has massed tens of thousands of troops and tanks, artillery and other combat vehicles in staging areas near Ukraine, suggesting that Russia is preparing a major military assault. That would not bring Ukraine back to Russia.  It would instead generate more sanctions on Russia, an increased flow of Western arms to Ukraine, a bolstering of NATO military presence near Russia’s borders — and dead Russian soldiers. The Russian military is undoubtedly stronger, but the Ukrainian military would exact a price.  Moreover, Kiev is preparing for partisan warfare, and an early December poll showed that one-third of those asked, including one-fourth in the country’s east, would take up arms if the Russians invade. It is time for the Russian leadership to reexamine the premises on which it has based its approach.  Bad understanding leads to bad policy, and the Kremlin appears poised to make another in a line of mistakes in its approach toward Ukraine.  This one would prove a tragedy for Ukraine … but also for Russia.",1,786,92.88,46.07,38.7,9.28,17.47,31.17,81.17,58.27,46.95,7.51,2.54,0.13,0.38,0,1.15,0.64,4.96,14.89,9.41,1.78,15.52,4.07,3.56,6.23,0.76,10.43,4.71,3.94,7.25,1.27,0.64,5.47,11.96,0.51,11.2,2.04,2.04,1.4,1.91,0.64,3.69,0,4.45,1.65,2.8,1.4,0.25,0.89,0,0.38,0.13,0,10.94,5.6,0.64,0.13,1.15,0,2.42,5.22,0.13,0.13,0,1.15,6.49,3.69,2.8,0,2.29,0.13,0.13,1.65,0.13,0.25,0.76,0.13,0,0.13,0,0,0,0.13,0.13,0,0,0.64,0,0.13,0,0.38,0.25,0,2.93,10.18,0.25,1.65,7.25,0.51,0.25,0.13,4.33,4.83,2.8,0.38,0.13,0,0.13,0,0,14.25,5.6,3.94,0.25,0,1.15,3.31

S .- NATO Talks,English,Russia,"President Vladimir Putin on Thursday accused the West of lying to Russia on NATO's expansion but noted “positive” developments with Washington over Moscow's demands for security guarantees, with direct talks expected in Geneva next year. The West has for weeks accused Russia of massing troops near its border with Ukraine and planning an invasion against Kiev. Asked about whether a war against Ukraine was a realistic possibility, Putin replied that Russia was responding to threats from Kiev and that its actions regarding Ukraine “depend on our security,” not on how talks with the U.S. proceed. “We have to keep an eye on what is happening in Ukraine, and on when they might attack,” he told journalists at his annual end-of-year press conference. “One gets the impression that [Ukraine] is preparing a third military campaign and we’re being warned not to interfere and not defend [Russian-speaking residents in eastern Ukraine] or face new sanctions,” Putin said. “We must react and do something about it.” At the same time, Putin said that ongoing negotiations with the United States on Russia’s proposed security guarantees were “positive” and hinted at fresh direct talks in the new year. “U.S. partners told us that they are ready to begin this discussion, these talks, at the very start of next year in Geneva,” Putin said. Putin repeated his demand that “there must not be any eastward NATO expansion,” one of several points in a draft list of security guarantees that Russia is seeking from the U.S.-led military bloc. “We were fooled by five waves of NATO’s eastward expansion. We’re not threatening anyone, they came to us. You’re asking us for guarantees, but it’s you who needs to give us guarantees immediately.” Putin then slammed Ukraine's development in recent years, saying there is “complete poverty"" in the country. He called the 2014 Maidan Revolution a “bloody coup d’etat” and accused Ukrainian “extremists” of planning operations to retake Crimea and the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine. Putin also defended Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and support of pro-Moscow rebels in the Donbass, saying that inhabitants of both regions had always thought of themselves as Russians. He stressed that Donbass residents alone should determine the region's future, adding that Russia was ready to act as a mediator to ""create a better future for the people living there.”",1,388,83.21,68.64,34.87,6.73,24.25,26.8,85.31,61.86,47.42,10.57,5.67,0,2.58,0.52,1.29,1.03,4.9,12.37,6.19,1.55,15.98,6.19,3.09,4.9,1.29,14.95,5.15,2.58,9.54,3.09,1.03,5.41,9.54,0.26,9.28,1.55,1.29,1.03,1.8,1.29,3.09,0,4.64,1.55,3.09,0.26,0,0.26,0.26,0,0,0.26,15.98,8.76,0.77,0.26,1.55,0.77,4.9,6.44,0,0,0,1.29,4.9,4.12,0.77,0,1.8,0,0.52,1.03,0.26,0,0.77,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.29,0,0.26,0.26,0.26,0,0,1.8,0.26,2.84,9.28,0.52,0.77,7.73,0.26,0,0,5.15,4.12,4.64,3.61,0,0,0,0,0,21.91,5.67,4.12,0,0,3.09,9.02

S ., Russia to Hold Security , Ukraine Talks Early January in Geneva",English,Russia,"The United States and Russia will hold much-anticipated talks in early January on European security and the Ukraine conflict after Moscow demanded NATO halt its eastward expansion. A spokesperson for the U.S. National Security Council told AFP late Monday that the talks with Russia will take place on Jan. 10. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov on Tuesday confirmed the date and said that the talks will take place in Geneva, where U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian leader Vladimir Putin met for their first summit in June. The Kremlin has grown increasingly insistent that the West and NATO are encroaching dangerously close to Russia's borders. Moscow earlier this month presented the West with sweeping security demands, saying NATO must not admit new members and seeking to bar the United States from establishing new bases in former Soviet republics. ""The United States looks forward to engaging with Russia,"" the National Security Council spokesperson said. ""When we sit down to talk, Russia can put its concerns on the table and we will put our concerns on the table with Russia's activities as well."" The Biden administration has insisted on taking action in lockstep with European allies. A US official said Tuesday that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered the USS Harry Truman carrier strike group to stay in the Mediterranean and hold off on sailing on to the Middle East. The purpose of the order was ""to reassure our allies and partners of our commitment to collective defence,"" the official said. Moscow and NATO representatives are also expected to meet on Jan. 12, while the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), which includes Russia and the United States, will address the tensions the following day. Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau of Poland, which takes the helm of the OSCE in the new year, will address the meeting, said a spokesperson for the organization founded during the Cold War as a forum involving Moscow and the West. The talks come after weeks of heightening tensions, with Washington accusing Russia of massing tens of thousands of troops around ex-Soviet Ukraine and plotting a winter invasion. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Moscow in the talks would take a ""hard line"" aimed at defending its interests and avoiding ""concessions."" At the United Nations, Russia's deputy envoy, Dmitry Polyanskiy, said the talks should be ""serious"" but also that Russia's draft agreements were not an ""ultimatum"" to the United States. ""I don't think that our colleagues will get away with some blah blah blah thing,"" he told reporters. ""It's a constructive proposal, but it's the proposal that works for everybody and that is in the interest of everybody,"" he said. Ukraine has been seeking to break from Moscow's sphere of influence and eventually join the NATO alliance. Russia already occupies a swath of its neighbor in the Crimean peninsula and is accused of fomenting a separatist pro-Moscow rebellion in the industrial east of the country. Deployment by Russia of tens of thousands of troops to the border sparked fears in Kiev and among its Western allies of a wider war, possibly including further seizures of Ukrainian territory. Putin denies planning to attack the neighboring country, saying the troop movements are to defend Russia against an encroaching Western military. The United States and its European partners have threatened to impose harsh economic sanctions if Russia invades Ukraine, while also offering to hold negotiations. The National Security Council spokesperson said Ukraine's interests would not be ignored in cutting any deal with Russia. Negotiations will include ""nothing about our allies and partners without our allies and partners, including Ukraine,"" the spokesperson said. ""President Biden's approach on Ukraine has been clear and consistent: unite the alliance behind two tracks — deterrence and diplomacy. We are unified as an alliance on the consequences Russia would face if it moves on Ukraine."" There was no immediate word on who would represent the two sides on Jan. 10. The meeting is part of the Strategic Security Dialogue initiative launched by Biden and Putin, which initially has focused on resuscitating post-Cold War nuclear arms control treaties.",1,682,94.13,69.91,23.15,11.31,22,30.06,82.4,57.48,43.7,5.87,2.2,0.15,1.47,0,0.29,0.15,3.67,14.37,9.82,1.17,14.66,5.57,2.2,5.87,0.88,12.76,5.28,1.91,9.97,4.84,1.03,4.25,5.57,0.59,4.99,0.44,0.73,1.03,0.59,0,2.2,0,3.81,1.47,2.35,0.59,0,0.59,0.15,0,0,0,14.81,9.09,1.76,0,0.88,0.29,4.99,6.89,0,0,0,0.29,6.6,5.28,1.17,0.15,3.37,0,0.44,2.79,0.15,0,0.59,0.29,0.29,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.15,0,0.88,0,0,0.44,0,1.61,0.29,3.08,10.26,0.88,1.32,7.33,0.29,0,0.59,3.96,3.96,3.96,1.91,0,0,0,0,0,14.52,5.13,3.52,0,0,1.47,4.4

European Union leaders, meeting in Brussels, insisted on ""the urgent need for Russia to de-escalate tensions caused by the military build-up along its border with Ukraine and aggressive rhetoric"". They reiterated a threat to impose ""massive consequences and severe cost"" on Moscow through sanctions, coordinated with the EU's partners in London and Washington. The U.S. has used similar language of ""massive"" retaliation in the event of a Russian invasion while attempting to reach out to Moscow to defuse the situation. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg branded Russia the ""aggressor"". Russian President Vladimir Putin wants direct dialogue with U.S. counterpart Joe Biden to resolve the stand-off, and is seeking security guarantees to stand down his troops. But the European leaders in their summit pushed for a return to the ""Normandy format"", a four-way dialogue between Paris, Berlin, Kiev and Moscow. On Wednesday, Russia handed a list of security demands to US Assistant Secretary of State Karen Donfried, who then came to NATO headquarters in Brussels to discuss them with Stoltenberg. The NATO chief also met Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and gave a joint news conference to insist that any decision on membership was a matter for Kiev and the alliance's 30 member states. ""We will not compromise on the right of Ukraine to choose its own path. We will not compromise on the right for NATO to protect and defend all NATO allies,"" Stoltenberg said. He said there would also be no compromising on NATO's partnership with Ukraine, describing it as important for both sides and ""not in any way a threat to Russia"". On Wednesday, Zelenskiy attended a prior summit with EU leaders — most of whose countries are also NATO members — and said that most of them supported Ukraine's position in the conflict. But he is frustrated that European powers in particular have refused to take preventive action against Russia, preferring to threaten a response in the event of Russian action. ""Since 2014, since the start of the war, I believe that basically Russia pushed Ukraine into NATO,"" he said. ""Basically I believe that today Russia itself is paving the difficult path of Ukraine to NATO."" He complained that, in his view, some EU members did not seem to have understood the extent of Ukraine's peril and urged them to act swiftly. On Wednesday, Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told Donfried that NATO should halt its eastward expansion and withdraw a promise that Ukraine could become a candidate for membership. A U.S. statement said Donfied would stress ""we can make diplomatic progress on ending the conflict in the Donbas through implementation of the Minsk agreements in support of the Normandy Format"". Ukraine and its closest supporters in the West want to cancel the opening of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will carry Russian gas supplies to Germany, by-passing Ukraine. Germany's new leader, Chancellor Olaf Scholz, has been cautious on this point, and some of the leaders meeting in Brussels fear pre-emptive sanctions will provoke rather than deter Russia. Getting Russia back to the negotiating table will not be easy. ""Moscow does not want to return to the Normandy format and wants to negotiate with the United States,"" a senior European diplomat told AFP. The diplomatic track was established at a summit in Minsk in 2015 where Putin accepted that France and Germany should play the role of moderators in the talks between the two belligerents. ""The Americans support a return to this format, and talks are underway with Moscow, but nothing has been agreed yet,"" the European envoy said.",1,623,96.12,61.05,14.12,5.6,24.92,28.57,78.81,54.9,44.78,6.1,3.05,0.32,0.64,0,0.96,0.8,3.05,13.32,8.51,0.96,17.01,4.65,1.61,5.14,1.28,10.75,3.69,1.77,7.87,2.57,0.32,4.98,9.15,0.48,8.67,1.28,1.77,2.09,0.64,0.32,2.25,0,4.33,1.28,3.05,1.12,0,1.12,0.32,0.64,0,0,15.25,8.83,1.93,0.32,1.77,0,4.17,6.74,0,0,0,0.96,6.26,4.98,1.28,0,3.05,0.16,0,2.73,0.16,0,0.16,0.16,0,0.16,0,0,0,0,0,0.32,0.64,0.48,0,0,0,0,1.61,0,2.41,8.67,0.32,1.77,7.06,0.16,0,0.16,2.57,4.33,2.41,1.12,0,0,0,0,0,16.37,4.98,4.65,0,0,1.77,4.98

Moscow is striving to complete what it began in 2014 in Crimea: to alter in its favor the terms on which the Cold War ended. The campaign began on Nov. 18, when President Vladimir Putin, speaking at a meeting of senior Foreign Ministry officials, called for “serious long-term guarantees that ensure Russia’s security.” On Dec. 1, at a ceremony for newly arrived foreign ambassadors, Putin was more specific. “While engaging in dialogue with the United States and its allies, we will insist on the elaboration of concrete agreements that would rule out any further eastward expansion of NATO and the deployment of weapons systems posing a threat to us in close proximity to Russia’s territory. We suggest that substantive talks on this topic should be started. I would like to note in particular that we need precisely legal, juridical guarantees, because our Western colleagues have failed to deliver on verbal commitments they made.” It would appear that Moscow began to review its “strategic patience” in relations with the West and Ukraine after NATO decided to grant Ukraine the status of Enhanced Opportunities Partner in June 2020. There was talk in Kiev of attaining the status of Major Non-NATO Ally, which would remove virtually all restrictions on military cooperation with the Americans. This, combined with Western sanctions against Russia, a lack of progress on implementing the Minsk agreements aimed at ending the conflict in eastern Ukraine, and the immobilization of Russian tools for influencing Ukrainian politics, was seen in Moscow as an alarming sign of Ukraine’s move into the Western security orbit. Even if the Minsk agreements are implemented in the way that Moscow would like, that still won’t enable Russia to achieve its strategic goals of keeping Ukraine in its own orbit of influence. Reintegrating the pro-Russian breakaway Donbass region into Ukraine’s political system won’t give Russia a veto right on Ukrainian foreign or defense policy. Kiev will still be able to marginalize the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk republics, just as President Volodymyr Zelenskiy managed to do with the pro-Russian oligarch Viktor Medvedchuk, his political party, and TV channels. Implementing the Minsk agreements may destabilize Ukraine in the short term, but Kiev will adapt rapidly, and then, NATO’s route into Ukraine — if not Ukraine’s into NATO — will be open. Moscow’s fixation on the Minsk agreements has prevented it from solving other problems in its relationship with Ukraine, and left Russia’s relationship with the West hostage to Kiev’s maneuvering. Now Moscow is seeking a way out of the impasse by trying to reach an agreement directly with the West that NATO will conclusively cease its expansion, which would force Ukraine to hammer out its relationship with Russia on Russia’s terms. To do this, Moscow needed to create a lever of influence on Western leaders that would prevent them from dismissing Russian concerns. That lever was provided by Russia’s increased military presence around Ukraine this year. The West believes the Russian leadership is now capable of conducting a limited military campaign against Ukraine that would force Kiev to accept terms once and for all for ending the conflict that has been simmering in the country’s east for nearly eight years now. Moscow used this demonstration of military strength to enter into direct discussion with the United States on its agenda. Along with promises that Ukraine won’t join NATO, Russia also wants guarantees that no NATO military infrastructure or facilities will appear on Ukrainian territory, even if it does not formally join the alliance. Moscow has made its demands public and is insisting that talks should begin as soon as possible. Putin’s call for legally binding agreements that NATO will not expand any further east has reduced its maneuvering room. It’s hard to imagine the alliance’s partners agreeing to any such thing, especially in a legally binding form, which would, in the United States, need to be ratified by the Senate. In any case, Moscow’s unrealistic demands — and their public announcement, when such sensitive issues are better discussed in private — have prompted suspicion in the West that they are simply a cover operation, and that the tight deadline issued by Moscow for starting talks indicates an imminent decision on a military operation. Nor has Moscow proposed any concessions of its own in exchange for the military and political limitations it would like to impose on NATO countries and Ukraine — other than repeating an old initiative for a moratorium on deploying short- and medium-range missiles in Europe. Still, we can assume that the military threat on Ukraine’s borders will prompt discussion within NATO of ceasing its expansion, especially if U.S. President Joe Biden (and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron) personally bring up the issue. In the United States, the possibility has been discussed at the level of experts. The question is how to formulate such a decision in a way that would suit both sides and would not require the North Atlantic Treaty to be amended. So is there a realistic format for a political undertaking not to expand NATO to Russia’s borders? There are two possible options. The first is to include a corresponding point in the 2022 NATO summit declaration in Madrid stating that the alliance will not expand any further to the east, and that this political declaration annuls all previous statements. That would allow NATO to disavow the declaration from the Bucharest summit in 2008, which promised that Ukraine and Georgia “will become members of NATO,” while preserving the open door policy enshrined in its founding treaty. Russia itself has already suggested something along these lines. The second option is an analogous point in NATO’s new strategic concept, which is planned to be adopted at the Madrid summit, or a combination of both of these formats. This would not provide legally binding guarantees: NATO’s strategic concept and its summit declarations are political documents and may be reviewed. But such a declaration at the top level would allow Russia to be reasonably confident that the bloc’s expansion would come to a halt. The political pledge made to Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990 that NATO would not expand its military infrastructure onto the territory of the former East Germany has never been broken. That is better than an unspoken promise not to accept Ukraine into NATO for another ten years. Diplomacy is the art of the possible, and this scenario, unlike others, is possible. The reaction of the NATO leadership has so far been sharply negative, but Biden has not yet spoken on the issue. It’s true that in any case, he doesn’t have a big enough majority in the Senate right now to get any legal guarantees of non-expansion ratified there. This is why the Iran nuclear deal was formatted as a political commitment, rather than a treaty obligation. Not to mention that within NATO, all thirty member states would have to ratify treaty obligations. Still, this should be the focus. An agreement to stop expanding NATO up to Russia’s border, regardless of its format, would be pivotal. It would open up the prospect of a different kind of relationship for Russia with the West and with Ukraine (as well as Georgia), while costing the NATO countries nothing but a change in rhetoric. Stopping NATO’s expansion would make it possible for Moscow and Kiev to hold direct talks on a conclusive resolution to the conflict based on the real state of affairs. If the two sides manage to reach an understanding on stopping NATO’s expansion to the east, then it should be possible to reach agreements fairly quickly on other “red lines” regarding Ukraine and also arms control. As in the late 1960s, direct interaction between Moscow and Washington could give a political framework to a future détente, within which agreements would become possible on European security. Still, escalation remains likely, due to unrealistic requirements being made under artificially short deadlines, as well as not enough emphasis on diplomacy — and too much on the military aspect.

The Baltic Sea pipeline is set to double supplies of cheap natural gas from Russia to Germany, which the European Union's top economy says is needed to help it transition from coal and nuclear energy. But the 10-billion-euro ($12 billion) project has for years been dogged by delays and drawn fierce criticism from Germany's eastern EU allies like Poland and from the United States. Critics say the project will increase Europe's dependence on Russian gas and Ukraine has described it as a ""geopolitical weapon."" ""Any new military action cannot remain without severe consequences,"" the Green minister told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, a Sunday weekly, referring to a Russian troop deployment on the Ukraine border. He warned that ""nothing can be excluded"" if ""there is a new violation of the territorial integrity"" of Ukraine. The new German government threatened to block the pipeline from operating if Russia invades Ukraine. ""In the event of further escalation this gas pipeline could not come into service,"" Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said. Habeck said: ""From a geopolitical point of view, the pipeline is a mistake,"" adding: ""All the countries were against it except Germany and Austria."" He added: ""The pipeline has however been built. And the question of it being put into service remains open and must be decided according to European and German law."" German authorities are waiting for the pipeline's Swiss-based ""Nord Stream 2 AG"" operating company to submit documents to restart the certification process. The pipeline would then also have to be approved by the European Commission — a process not likely to be completed in the first half of next year.

A senior US official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the tone ""was serious and substantive."" But there was no disguising the depth of disagreement — or the dangerously high stakes on the fringes of eastern Europe — ahead of in-person negotiations between high-ranking Russian and U.S. officials on Jan. 10. Biden ""made clear that the United States and its allies and partners will respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine,"" Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement. Ushakov, referring to Washington's repeated threats of economic sanctions as a response to a Ukraine attack, said this would be ""a colossal mistake. We hope this will not happen."" Ushakov also said that Russia is looking for a concrete ""result"" in the January talks in Geneva, while the White House said it, too, wanted action — de-escalation by Russia's massive military presence on the Ukrainian border. ""President Biden reiterated that substantive progress in these dialogues can occur only in an environment of de-escalation rather than escalation,"" Psaki said. Washington and its European allies accuse Russia of threatening former Soviet territory Ukraine with a new invasion. Some 100,000 Russian troops are massed near the border of the country, where Putin already seized the Crimea region in 2014 and is accused of fomenting a pro-Russian separatist war which erupted that same year in the east. Moscow describes the troop presence as protection against expansion of NATO, although Ukraine has not been offered membership in the military alliance. Earlier this month, the Russians issued a sweeping set of demands, including guarantees that NATO not expand and a bar on new U.S. military bases in former territories of the Soviet Union. The United States rejects what it calls a bid by the Moscow to dictate independent countries' futures. In a readout after the call, the Kremlin stressed that Biden told Putin that U.S. offensive weapons would not be deployed in Ukraine. The White House, however, said Biden merely reaffirmed existing policy. ""President Biden made clear that the U.S. is continuing to provide defensive security assistance to Ukraine and is not introducing offensive strike weapons. This was not a new commitment,"" a U.S. official told AFP. And U.S. officials repeated warnings of blistering economic sanctions backed both by Washington and EU capitals if Russia does attack Ukraine further. Biden ""laid out two paths,"" a senior administration official said. ""One is a path of diplomacy... and the other path is more focused on deterrence, including serious costs."" The January talks will see Russian officials sitting down separately with negotiators representing the United States, NATO and the regional OSCE security forum, which also includes the United States. Russia's delegation will be led by Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, and the U.S. delegation by Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman. Ukraine, which wants to join NATO but has been told it is far from being ready to win acceptance, is eager not to be cut out of any wider deal. US officials have been at pains to insist that no decision will be taken behind the Ukrainians' backs and that while US troops would not be sent to defend the country against Russia, ongoing deliveries of weapons and other military assistance are set to expand if Moscow attacks.",1,613,91.02,30.96,39.4,7.18,21.89,30.83,82.06,56.28,43.23,5.22,1.31,0,0.82,0,0.16,0.16,3.92,14.03,8.65,1.31,13.21,6.36,1.96,5.55,1.63,12.4,6.69,2.45,9.79,2.61,0.49,6.85,9.79,0.33,9.46,0.33,1.14,1.63,1.14,0.33,4.89,0,5.06,1.79,3.26,0.98,0.33,0.65,0.16,0.33,0,0,12.72,8.81,1.31,0,1.96,0.65,5.06,4.08,0,0,0,0.16,8.65,7.01,1.47,0.16,3.43,0,0.49,2.45,0.49,0,0.33,0.33,0.33,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.49,0.49,0,0,0,0.33,1.47,0.33,2.12,11.09,0.98,0.65,8.65,0.82,0,0.33,3.92,5.87,3.43,1.79,0,0,0,0,0,16.97,7.18,4.57,0,0,0.82,4.4

Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko’s comments follow NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg’s offer of “meaningful dialogue” with Moscow in exchange for “aggressor” Russia standing down troops near Ukraine. “We haven’t received any concrete serious proposals from NATO. All our previously made proposals on de-escalation remained unanswered,” Grushko said in comments to the state-run RIA Novosti news agency. Russia’s Foreign Ministry this week handed a list of security demands to visiting U.S. Assistant State Secretary Karen Donfried, who then traveled to NATO headquarters in Brussels to discuss them with Stoltenberg. President Vladimir Putin this week requested to “immediately launch negotiations” with the U.S. and NATO. Putin seeks international legal guarantees for Russia’s security before he withdraws his troops, which the U.S. warns signals Russia’s imminent invasion of Ukraine. Grushko’s colleague Sergei Ryabkov previously warned that Russia could act militarily if the talks it demands with the U.S. and NATO do not materialize. Stoltenberg also stressed during a joint press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that NATO would not yield to Russia’s demands to prevent Ukraine’s efforts to join NATO and the bloc’s right to defend its allies. The U.S. and the European Union threatened “massive” sanctions against Moscow in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine. Putin denies planning an invasion and instead blames NATO for the rise in tensions, including through U.S.-led military exercises in the Black Sea. In addition to closing Ukraine’s door to NATO membership, the Russian president demands that the Western military alliance halt weapons deployment on its western border.",1,285,97.38,66.84,22.93,2.09,23.75,40.35,77.89,44.21,34.39,5.26,2.11,0,0.7,0,0.7,0.35,3.16,10.53,6.67,0,15.44,1.75,1.05,3.86,1.05,5.96,4.21,1.75,12.98,3.51,0.7,8.77,5.96,0.35,5.61,0.7,1.05,0.7,0.7,0.35,2.46,0,4.21,0.7,3.51,0.7,0,0.7,0.35,0.35,0,0,15.09,8.42,1.05,0.35,1.4,0.7,3.16,7.37,0,0,0,0.7,11.93,10.53,1.4,0,3.51,0,0,3.51,0.35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.35,0,0,0,0,2.46,0,0.7,10.88,1.05,1.75,7.02,0.35,0,0.7,3.51,3.51,1.4,1.4,0,0,0,0,0,20.7,9.12,2.11,0,0,4.21,5.26

President Vladimir Putin said earlier Thursday that Russia “must react” to what he alleged are Ukrainian plans to attack the pro-Moscow territories in eastern Ukraine known as the Donbass. Putin’s claims follow weeks of Western warnings that Russia could invade Ukraine as early as January. The independent Meduza news website reported earlier this week that recruiters in Russia had started gathering groups of mercenaries for a ""combat mission"" in Donbass, but that the scope of their work was unknown. According to Reuters, recruited Russian mercenaries are undergoing special training for defensive and sabotage purposes in the Donbass. “They are gathering everybody with combat experience,” the news agency quoted one of the recruited mercenaries as saying. The fighters said they were unaware of Russian attack plans or preparations, Reuters reported. One of the unnamed mercenaries reportedly said he was planning to join fellow fighters on the Russian side of the border with Ukraine’s separatist-controlled Luhansk region. Separatist leaders said they were either unaware of or not involved in the latest recruitment drive, Reuters reported. The Kremlin, which maintains that any Russian nationals on the ground are there voluntarily, denied official links with Russian private military contractors in eastern Ukraine. “It's the first we've heard of this and we don't know how reliable these assertions are,” Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying. The reports follow Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu’s claims that U.S. private military companies have stationed troops in eastern Ukraine for “provocations with unidentified chemical components.” At the same time, Russia and the United States have signaled readiness to launch talks over Moscow’s sweeping security demands as soon as early January. Faced with accusations of massing tens of thousands troops near Ukraine's border, Russia last week sent a draft list of its demands to the U.S., which among others includes a call to block Ukraine from future NATO membership. Washington has signaled readiness to discuss some of the issues raised by Russia, but stressed that it “will never agree to” Moscow’s other demands.",1,365,91.94,40.06,55.65,4.89,24.33,36.16,78.63,52.6,40.55,7.4,2.47,0,0.55,0,0.55,1.1,4.93,12.05,6.3,1.37,15.34,6.3,1.1,4.11,0.82,11.23,6.85,2.74,8.22,2.19,1.1,4.93,9.59,0.55,9.04,2.19,1.1,0.55,1.64,0,4.38,0,3.56,0.82,2.74,0.27,0,0.27,0.27,0,0,0,12.6,8.22,0.27,0,1.92,0.27,3.56,4.66,0,0,0,0.82,5.75,3.29,2.19,0.27,4.38,0,0.27,4.11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.27,0,0.55,0,0,0,0,0.55,0,2.47,9.32,0.82,1.1,7.12,0,0.27,0,5.21,5.48,3.01,1.92,0.27,0,0.27,0,0,15.89,5.21,3.84,0,0,2.74,4.11

Although any new Russian invasion could be devastating, they must prepare for the possibility. The Brezhnev-era Kremlin underestimated the West. In the late 1970s, the USSR began deploying SS-20 theater-range ballistic missiles aimed at Europe and Japan. Despite Moscow’s fierce campaign of propaganda, disinformation, and intimidation, NATO responded by deploying in Europe missiles of comparable range. Having failed to scare NATO into submission, hidebound Soviet leaders lost face. Then a liberalizing leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, came to power and agreed with President Ronald Reagan to ban both sides’ missiles. Soviet leaders in the “era of stagnation” may have believed their own false propaganda that the West was weak and disunited.  Today’s Kremlin may be making the same mistake. On December 17, Moscow publicized proposed demands which would in effect require the U.S. to withdraw from Europe and NATO to collapse. Only a day later, the Kremlin said it might “up the ante.” Nonetheless, on December 21 U.S. national security advisor Jake Sullivan said the U.S. was ready for talks in “full coordination with our European allies and partners.” In his December 23 press conference, Putin said he had “so far seen a positive reaction” to Moscow's proposals, but satellite photos show that in mid-December Russia was still deploying more tanks, short-range ballistic missiles, and other arms near Ukraine. Russia’s demands would force the U.S. to remove its nuclear weapons from Europe and forego deployment of theater-range missiles, even though such weapons could be deployed in European Russia. Proposed accords would ban NATO from admitting any “former Soviet republic” even though NATO has rejected such a ban. They would require that NATO withdraw infrastructure in its eastern members, but the heightened Russian threat to Ukraine may spur NATO to do the opposite. Evidently anxious about popular uprisings against its rule, the Kremlin also demands a ban on “actions aimed at changing the political or social order.” ""The Kremlin knows how to negotiate constructively, as it did successfully when it achieved the New START Treaty and the Iran nuclear agreement. On December 21, President Vladimir Putin hinted that the purpose of the new unrealistic demands was to help create a justification for war: “If our Western counterparts continue a clearly aggressive line, we will undertake proportionate military-technical countermeasures.” Thus, NATO might be wise to consider that Russia could launch a wider invasion of Ukraine. Wars always bring uncertainties, but several considerations could be relevant. First, any attempt to seize a large area east of the Dnipro River, including such cities as Karkhiv, Dnipro, and Odessa, and possibly Kyiv, would pose a major military operational challenge and take time. Looking at a notional scenario of an invasion by 130,000 Russian troops, RAND found that the operation would take “weeks, if not months, to fully develop and execute.” And an invasion could meet resistance and incur heavy casualties. Second, in 2014 Russian invaders faced a disorganized but determined Ukrainian opposition, but this time they would confront a better trained, armed, and motivated fighting force. Even a Russian “shock and awe” assault – mass cyber and electronic attacks, and a multi-front combined arms operation – might not easily carry the day. Ukraine’s defenses could be stressed but still slow invaders. Many Ukrainian commanders and soldiers are battle-hardened from the seven-year war in the Donbas. To reduce risks from drone attacks, some Ukrainian forces could disperse in small squads on ATVs or other mobile platforms. Equipped with precision-guided mortars, guided anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, and loitering munitions, mobile forces could frustrate some Russian battle plans. Third, if Ukraine were at risk of being overrun or if adjacent NATO allies were threatened, NATO might intervene. As in the 1973 Yom Kippur War when Israel was threatened with potential defeat, the U.S. could airlift military aid. Washington has not provided Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, which could down Russian helicopters and low-flying fixed wing aircraft, but in an extreme scenario it might do so. Although Biden says that providing U.S. troops is “not on the table,” in compelling circumstances NATO could unleash formidable air and naval power. Fourth, the Kremlin might be tempted think that fears of a widened war or of attacks by cyber weapons, long-range precision guided missiles, or even limited use of non-strategic nuclear forces would deter NATO from intervening militarily. These concerns might be a factor, but the Alliance has prepared to respond to aggression with its own tools of coercion. For example, it could mount cyber assaults that disrupt Russia’s economy and financial system and military logistics for its fighters in Ukraine. Fifth, Ukraine could mount a longer-term insurgency against Russian occupiers, which might be stretched thin or rely partly on ill-trained conscripts.  On December 19, The Washington Post said the Biden administration was exploring ways to aid guerillas. An insurgency might be sustainable if Ukraine west of the Dnipro River or if an adjacent NATO member state were to be a sanctuary and source of resupply. At the same time, Russian reactions to armed resistance could be “swift, direct, and brutal.” The Kremlin may err if it thinks Ukraine or NATO would easily submit to aggression. The hour is late, but Kremlin leaders might consider instead seeking a stable European security architecture that protects Russia’s interests while also allowing for a vibrant and sovereign Ukraine.

Mercenaries Preparing Donbass  Provocation  Russian Defense Chief,English,Russia,"Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu claimed on Tuesday that U.S. private military companies have stationed troops in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine and are preparing a “provocation using unknown chemical components.” Shoigu’s statements came during a Defense Ministry meeting in Moscow amid growing fears that Russia could launch an invasion of Ukraine. “We have identified the presence of over 120 members of U.S. mercenary groups in the cities of Avdiivka and Krasny Liman to commit provocations…Tanks filled with unidentified chemical components were delivered to the cities of Avdeevka and Krasny Liman to commit provocations,” the state-run TASS news agency quoted Shoigu as saying. Shoigu, considered a trusted ally of Vladimir Putin, also slammed the U.S. for increased tensions near Russia’s border. “The United States is building up its military presence at Russian borders. In the countries of Eastern Europe, American units with a total number of about 8,000 servicemen are deployed on a rotational basis,” he said. Shoigu further boasted of Russia’s improved military, saying that the country’s army was a “world leader” in terms of its modernity. Around 100,000 Russian troops are currently believed to be stationed on the border with Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied plotting an invasion into Ukraine, saying it is in its right to move troops within its borders.

The call comes after Moscow earlier this month presented Western capitals with sweeping security demands, saying NATO must not admit new members and seeking to bar the United States from opening new bases in ex-Soviet countries. The call, which will begin at 20:30 GMT, also comes ahead of talks between representatives of the two rivals in Geneva in January, with Washington saying it expects to discuss the Ukraine conflict and Moscow insisting its security demands be contended with. Biden, who is at his home in Delaware for the New Year's holiday, will stress in his call with Putin that Washington is looking for a ""diplomatic path"" out of the crisis, a senior administration official told reporters. ""But we are also prepared to respond if Russia advances with a further invasion of Ukraine,"" Biden will tell Putin, the official said, adding that Washington remained ""gravely concerned"" about the military build-up and wanted to see the Russian forces return ""to their regular training areas."" In a holiday message to Biden hours before the call, Putin said he is ""convinced"" that ""we can move forward and establish an effective Russian-American dialogue based on mutual respect and consideration of each other's national interests."" His spokesman Dmitry Peskov then told reporters that Moscow is ""in the mood for a conversation."" ""We believe that only through talks is it possible to solve all the immediate problems that we have in abundance between us,"" Peskov said, adding that the call was Putin's initiative. The call will be the second in less than a month between the two leaders, with Biden in early December warning Putin of ""severe consequences"" if Russian troops invaded Ukraine. Washington has led the charge in raising the alarm over Russian troop movements near its ex-Soviet neighbor Ukraine, where the West says Moscow has massed around 100,000 forces ahead of a possible winter invasion. Putin has denied the allegation and accused the West of stoking tensions, saying that NATO's eastward expansion is a threat to Russian security. Ukraine, which has since 2014 fought a pro-Russia insurgency in its east that has claimed over 13,000 lives, has repeatedly said it wants to join the U.S.-led security alliance. But Russia considers ex-Soviet states to be within its sphere of influence, and has grown increasingly insistent that the only way out of the crisis is the West accepting its demands that would redraw Europe's security architecture. At the talks in Geneva next month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has vowed that Moscow will take a ""hard line"" aimed at avoiding concessions. His ministry on Thursday said that delegations for the talks will be led by Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman. The United States has called some of the Russian positions non-starters, but said it is willing to talk and will also bring up its own concerns. Ahead of the U.S.-Russia talks, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke by telephone on Wednesday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. ""I was assured of full U.S. support for Ukraine in countering Russian aggression,"" Zelenskiy tweeted afterward. Blinken also spoke separately to his counterparts from Britain, France and Germany on ""coordination to deter any further Russian aggression against Ukraine"", State Department spokesman Ned Price said. The Biden administration has vowed to take all actions in lockstep with its European allies. Following the Geneva talks, Russian delegates will meet with delegates of the NATO alliance ahead of a meeting of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, a key Cold War forum that brings together Moscow and the West.

",English,Russia,"One of the most asked questions in recent weeks has been whether Russia will attack Ukraine, despite a slight lessening of tensions in the wake of last week’s video call between the Russian and U.S. presidents. But how would ordinary Russians respond to a war with neighboring Ukraine? Our 2015 research — “Do Russians Want War?” — showed that there is little enthusiasm for a “real,” large-scale war among members of Russia’s modern, urban society (the country’s military operations in Syria and eastern Ukraine in recent years were not seen as real wars). The military action in Donbas in 2014, which took place against the backdrop of the triumphal seizure of Crimea, was viewed very positively by the Russian public. As soon as it became clear that Donbas was a different form of operation to Crimea, however (far bloodier and more destructive), public opinion went on the defensive: “Russia has nothing to do with it, the United States and Ukraine are to blame for all the loss of life, and there’s no real war under way in any case.” A very similar sentiment dominates today: a recent survey showed that 50 percent of respondents blame the United States and NATO for the worsening situation in Ukraine (16 percent blame Ukraine itself). Only 4 percent consider Russia to be responsible for escalating tensions. For a few years, the unprecedented patriotic surge of 2014 served as symbolic compensation for the socioeconomic problems that had already begun. Russians lapped up the real and imaginary threats that were fed to them, and generally assessed military action as justified, defensive, and/or preventative. These wars took place in the background: TV reports did not dwell on the brutal and bloody reality of armed conflict. At the same time, the militarization of official rhetoric and the growing authority of the army — which overtook the presidency in a list of most trusted institutions in 2020 — strengthened the so-called “Crimea consensus.” The sociological parameters began to change in 2018, however, with the dissipation of the rallying-around-the-flag effect. If in 2014 26 percent of respondents said that “Russia was surrounded by enemies on all sides,” then that opinion was shared by just 16 percent in 2020. The number of Russians who believed it was futile to look for enemies because “the root of the evil was Russia’s own mistakes” rose from 17 percent to 25 percent in the same period. The Crimea consensus and the symbolic might of state institutions remained, but they lost their power to mobilize. War started to frighten people. The average Russian is tired of self-deception and of persuading themselves that if a war does happen, it will not impact their lives or those of family members. Russian conformists are, of course, traditionally bellicose people, but theirs is the bellicosity of propaganda television talk shows, or the language of online hate. No conformists want a large-scale war: conscription is not part of the social contract, particularly at a time of accelerating inflation and economic stagnation. State propaganda has overused its powers of mobilization. Instead of mobilization, it has created a fear of world war. At the end of 2018, 56 percent of respondents to a Levada Center survey said there was a significant military threat from other countries. This year, the fear of a world war has increased dramatically, reaching a solid second place in a Levada Center list of the top issues causing Russians to worry. The other fears that have risen in parallel with that of war are those of an increasingly harsh political regime, mass repression, and arbitrary rule: the authoritarianization of the Russian political regime has not gone unnoticed. It’s symptomatic that the worsening of the public mood has gone hand in hand with a fall or stagnation in the approval ratings of the president and the authorities overall. The year 2018 was a pivotal moment in this process. To a large extent, it was the move to raise the retirement age that destroyed the classic Putin-era social contract: “you provide for us and leave our Soviet-style social handouts alone, and we’ll vote for you and take no interest in your stealing and bribe-taking.” A high level of support for Putin in the 2018 presidential elections was mistakenly interpreted by the authorities as real political credit, rather than indifference and mostly symbolic trust. The pandemic has only confirmed this bifurcation in attitudes toward the authorities: we support the symbols — the flag, the national anthem, and Putin as a representation of our geopolitical might — but we don’t trust specific initiatives and the actions of government at various political levels. This sort of mute dissatisfaction was visible during the 2021 parliamentary elections, when people voted for the Communist Party as an abstract alternative to the current authorities. There is one final aspect to this problem. When people talk about a war, they mostly mean a conflict with Ukraine (even if it would involve NATO, the United States, and the West). Of course, if war breaks out, state propaganda will convince most Russians that it’s necessary, and that we are, in fact, “liberating” our Ukrainian brethren from an alien government (even if Ukrainians chose that government themselves in free elections). This will all take place despite the fact that in 2021, 23 percent of Russians believed Russia and Ukraine should be friendly neighbors but still have their own borders: only 17 percent of respondents supported a unification of the two states. War is the business of young people and conscripts. But 66 percent of Russians aged between 18 and 24 have a positive or very positive attitude toward Ukraine. That’s despite a backdrop of unceasing vitriol directed toward Ukraine on state television, and the persistent, oft-repeated idea that it is external attacks that require Russia to take defensive measures. To put it simply, before launching an offensive, it’s worth thinking about who will fight in that offensive and how willingly, and to what extent an active conflict will prompt people to rally around Putin. The evidence suggests that even in the best-case scenario, the mobilization effect will be nonexistent.

A district court in Russia’s Rostov region located on the Ukrainian border disclosed that a convicted senior manager was in charge of buying, stocking and selling food to Russian troops stationed in eastern Ukraine. “This food was intended to be sent to military units of the Russian Armed Forces stationed on the territory of the DNR and LNR,” the court said in its verdict. The ruling was no longer visible on the court's website as of Thursday afternoon. Moscow denies the presence of Russian Armed Forces soldiers in the Donbass, the rebel-held region which has been locked in a protracted war with Ukrainian forces since 2014. It has maintained that any Russian nationals fighting in the conflict-torn region were there on a voluntary basis and not in any official capacity. Western countries accuse Russia of providing troops, equipment and funding to the separatists and have sanctioned Moscow over its role in the conflict. The Kremlin on Thursday called the November verdict's information on Russian troops a “mistake,” reiterating the official line that Russian troops are not stationed in eastern Ukraine. DNR and LNR refer to the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk “people’s republics” in eastern Ukraine. The U.S. RFE/RL news organization estimated that the bi-weekly supplies of 1,300 tons of products mentioned in the court documents would feed around 26,000 Russian troops. The defendant, identified as V.N. Zabaluev, deputy regional manager for military nutrition of the local company “Tekhnologiya,” admitted to have bribed officials up to four times in 2019. RFE/RL’s Russian bureau Svoboda reported, citing the verdict, that there may be other companies engaged in supplying Russian troops in eastern Ukraine with food. The court sentenced Zabaluev to five years in prison on charges of transferring 990,000 rubles ($13,500) from his boss to a military epidemiological official to gain favor with the authorities and avoid disruptions in the supply chain.",1,331,99,49.04,43.51,5.38,23.64,34.14,78.25,48.94,41.09,3.32,0.3,0,0,0,0.3,0,3.02,14.8,10.27,2.42,17.22,4.83,0.91,3.32,0.91,7.25,4.23,1.81,9.67,2.11,0.3,7.25,7.25,0.3,6.95,1.51,1.21,0.6,1.51,0,1.81,0,2.42,0.3,2.11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.46,3.93,0.3,0,0.91,0.6,1.51,4.23,0,0,0,0.3,7.25,3.02,3.93,0.3,5.44,0,0,3.93,1.51,0,1.51,0.3,0,0.3,0,0,0,1.51,0,0,0,0.6,0,0,0,0.3,0.3,0,1.21,13.29,0,0,12.69,0.6,0,0,2.11,2.72,1.21,0.6,0,0,0,0,0,16.62,5.14,4.23,0,0,1.81,5.44

Weeks of Russian military buildup near the Ukrainian border have raised alarm in the West that Russia might invade Ukraine as early as January. Moscow, meanwhile, blames NATO for provocations and threatening its security. Russia has repeatedly said it wants a legally binding guarantee that Ukraine will never join NATO and that the alliance will halt its expansion toward Russian borders. In the list of demands published on the Russian Foreign Ministry website on Friday, Moscow asks NATO to abandon all military activities not just in Ukraine, but also Eastern Europe, the Caucasus region and Central Asia. Russia also asks the U.S. not to establish any new military bases on the territory of former Soviet states and for NATO to guarantee that it will block future membership for any former Soviet republic. Russia demands that NATO pledge not to deploy troops to Eastern Europe without Russian consent, with the alliance prohibited from increasing troop numbers past those of 1997, before NATO expanded into Eastern Europe. The proposal would de facto ban NATO from deploying forces in former-communist member states including Poland, the Czech Republic and the Baltics. Another point seeks to reaffirm that Moscow and the U.S.-led alliance “do not consider each other adversaries” and that the two will “resolve all disputes peacefully and refrain from the use of force.” Russia’s Foreign Ministry handed the list to visiting U.S. diplomat Karen Donfried this week and President Vladimir Putin reiterated his demand that talks between the U.S.and NATO on international legal guarantees for Russia’s security begin “immediately.” Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told journalists in Moscow on Friday that Russia was ""ready"" as early as Saturday to begin security talks with the U.S. He also said Moscow was “extremely disappointed” by signals coming from the West regarding Russia’s proposals on security guarantees. Meanwhile, the U.S. said it wouldn’t negotiate without input from Europe. ""We've managed to engage Russia over strategic concerns for decades,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said. ""There's no reason we can't do that moving forward to reduce instability, but we're going to do that in partnership and coordination with our European allies and partners.” A senior official on Friday told reporters that the United States was willing to discuss security proposals put forward by Russia but disagreed with parts of them. ""We are prepared to discuss them. That said, there are some things in this document that the Russians know will be unacceptable,"" the official told reporters on condition of anonymity. The EU on Thursday rejected Russia’s bid to block Kiev’s NATO ambitions and repeated that it will impose ""massive consequences and severe costs"" on Russia if the country decides to invade Ukraine. Earlier this week, Ryabkov warned that Russia will respond “militarily”  if the Western military bloc does not guarantee an end to its eastward expansion. The sweeping demands will have great consequences for the balance of power on the European continent and experts said the West was unlikely to accept the terms presented by Russia. “The demands from Moscow appear to make any negotiation much more difficult. Seeking limits on NATO deployments and exercises on the territory of NATO member states is likely to be a non-starter in Washington,” Matthew Rojansky, director of the Wilson Center's Kennan Institute in Washington, told The Moscow Times. “The Kremlin cannot have a realistic expectation it will get legally binding commitments of this nature from NATO, but that may not be the point — rather it may be to shape negotiations in the shadow of a looming military threat to Ukraine and, by extension, to Europe,” Rojansky added. Rojansky pointed out that the message from the West to Russia has also been clear, that any further “aggression against Ukraine or any other state will not be tolerated, and will be met with an unprecedented response.” “In sum, these will be difficult but still vitally important negotiations.” Russia-based experts also doubted the West was likely to accept the latest demands. “Publication of Russian proposed agreements with U.S. and NATO on [European security] may suggest that Moscow (rightly) considers their acceptance by the West unlikely,” Dmitry Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, tweeted shortly after Russia published the demands. Trenin added that Russia “will have to assure its security single-handedly, most probably by military-technical means.” Andrei Kortunov, head of the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC), a Kremlin-aligned think tank, said that the Kremlin likely doesn't expect the West to accept its demands. “This is a bargaining position — [the Kremlin] is trying to get some degree of partial acceptance. Of course, there is a real risk to making these sorts of demands, especially if the West takes a harsh position, but clearly, the Kremlin thinks that the risk is justified in the circumstances,” Kortunov told The Moscow Times.

European gas prices rocketed Tuesday to all-time highs on strong winter demand and simmering geopolitical tensions between key supplier Russia and consumer nations. Europe's reference Dutch TTF gas price jumped nearly 20 percent from Monday to hit 175.00 euros per megawatt hour in early afternoon trading. ""Gazprom's actions are anti-competitive and have significant negative consequences for all European consumers,"" Yuriy Vitrenko, head of Ukraine's state energy company Naftogaz, said in a statement. ""Gazprom sharply reduced its delivery of natural gas to the European spot market, despite growing market demand,"" Vitrenko added. He also accused Gazprom of preventing other companies from supplying additional gas to Europe. Naftogaz said that Gazprom seeks to ""create an artificial deficit of gas to pressure the European Union into securing the rapid commissioning of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline."" The Ukrainian company said it filed a complaint with the European Commission against Gazprom ""abusing its dominant position on the European gas market."" The Nord Stream 2 pipeline via the Baltic Sea is set to double supplies of cheap natural gas from Russia to Germany, which the European Union's top economy says is needed to help it transition from coal and nuclear energy. But critics say Nord Stream 2 will increase Europe's dependence on Russian gas and Ukraine has described the pipeline, which bypasses its territory and deprives it of transit fees, as a ""geopolitical weapon"".

Shipments through the Yamal pipeline — which runs through Belarus and Poland to Germany — were at their lowest for at least a month over the weekend, Interfax reported, citing market data. Daily shipments fell from 27 million cubic meters (mcm) Friday to 5.2 mcm and 4.7 mcm on Saturday and Sunday, respectively. Gazprom also booked only minimal additional capacity on the transit route Monday — 3.8 mcm — worrying markets as gas prices rose across Europe once more. Gas prices climbed above $1,700 per thousand cubic meters on Monday — 70% higher than the levels seen in September when politicians across the continent first started worrying about a possible Russian squeeze on supplies ahead of the winter. The Yamal pipeline operates at a full capacity of 89 mcm per day, meaning flows were operating at only 4% of capacity Monday. Russia and Gazprom have previously been accused of trying to squeeze the European gas market to advance its Nord Stream 2 project and push European countries to sign long-term gas deals with Gazprom that guarantee supplies at fixed prices. The company increased supplies to Europe in the second half of November and early December, though prices have remained elevated given low storage levels in Europe, fears of conflict in Ukraine and new delays to Nord Stream 2’s certification. The Yamal pipeline is one of Gazprom’s major supply routes into the continent, in addition to the first Nord Stream pipeline and transit through Ukraine. Nord Stream is operating at full capacity and Russia has been reluctant to book additional capacity on the Ukrainian route in recent months.

The defense ministry said in a statement that the drills for Southern Military District forces had taken place in a host of southern regions including Rostov, Krasnodar and Crimea, which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014. But the drills also took place further afield, including in Stavropol, Astrakhan, North Caucasus republics and even in Russia's Caucasus ally Armenia. The defense ministry said the troops were returning to their permanent bases and that stand-by units would be readied for the New Year's holidays. Western countries have accused Russia of massing upwards of 100,000 troops near Ukraine ahead of a possible winter invasion. According to Kiev's estimates, the number of Russian troops along Ukraine's borders has increased from around 93,000 troops in October to 104,000 now. Russia says it is free to move its forces on its territory how it sees fit and denies that it is planning a large-scale attack. It has presented the West with sweeping security demands, saying NATO must not admit new members and seeking to bar the United States from establishing new bases in former Soviet republics. Tensions reached a boiling point on Wednesday when President Vladimir Putin said Russia would take ""appropriate retaliatory"" military steps in response to what he called the West's ""aggressive stance"".

The West has for weeks raised alarm over Russian military buildup near Ukraine and fears of a Russian invasion of its ally. Moscow denies planning an invasion into Ukraine and accuses U.S.-led NATO of threatening its security by expanding its presence near Russian borders. “If our Western colleagues continue the obviously aggressive stance, we will take appropriate retaliatory military-technical measures and react harshly to unfriendly steps,” Putin said at a Defense Ministry board meeting, according to the state-run TASS news agency. He did not specify which “military-technical” measures would be taken. The Russian president stressed that Moscow “doesn't want armed conflicts or bloodshed” and that it “has every right” to take what he views as steps that ensure the country’s security and sovereignty. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, meanwhile, said the U.S. has “expressed readiness” to launch dialogue with Russia on its proposed security guarantees that seek to limit NATO's eastward expansion. But Putin stressed that Moscow will only accept “long-term, legally binding guarantees” with Washington, accusing the U.S. of withdrawing from international treaties “that for one reason or another become uninteresting to them.” Russia last week sent the U.S. a list of sweeping demands that seek guarantees for NATO to abandon its military activities in Eastern Europe and Central Asia; to block future NATO membership for any post-Soviet country; and for the U.S. not to establish any new military bases on the territory of former Soviet states. The U.S. and European Union have issued repeated warnings to Russia that any military action in Ukraine would be met with sanctions far worse than those it levied in 2014, when Moscow annexed Crimea from Kiev and conflict broke out between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. Following Putin's comments, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance will “not compromise” on Ukraine's right to “choose its own path” and seek NATO membership. Also at Tuesday's Defense Ministry meeting, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu claimed that U.S. private military companies have stationed troops in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine and are preparing a “provocation using unknown chemical components.”",1,381,90.23,41.62,46.12,1,31.75,36.22,80.31,50.13,38.58,7.09,1.31,0,0.52,0,0.52,0.26,5.77,11.55,5.51,0.52,14.17,3.94,1.57,5.51,1.05,8.14,7.09,1.57,9.71,2.1,0.26,7.35,9.19,0.26,8.92,1.31,1.57,0.79,1.84,1.05,3.15,0,5.77,1.05,4.72,1.31,0,1.31,0.79,0.26,0,0,9.97,6.3,0.79,0,2.1,0.52,2.36,3.94,0,0.26,0,0.52,9.71,7.87,1.84,0,1.57,0,0.26,1.31,0,0,0.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.26,0,0.26,1.05,0,0,0.26,0,1.84,0,2.36,13.12,1.84,1.84,8.66,0.26,0,0.26,3.94,2.62,1.84,1.84,0.26,0.26,0,0,0,19.95,6.82,2.89,0,0,1.84,8.4

Four suspects are being tried in absentia for launching a BUK missile that hit flight MH17 over war-torn eastern Ukraine in 2014, killing all 298 people on board. Prosecutors launched closing arguments in the trial Monday, saying the four suspects played pivotal roles in securing the BUK system, which was most likely intended to strike a Ukrainian war plane. ""If this was the intention, that doesn't change the accusation of making it a criminal act,"" public prosecutor Thijs Berger told the judges. ""A mistake in target also makes no difference to the evidence that such a crime has been committed."" The suspects ""used a BUK missile as a tool to serve their own military interest and hit MH17 with it,"" he added. International investigators say the BUK missile was originally brought from a Russian military base, ostensibly to be used in the fight against Ukrainian forces. Berger said the men on trial ""did not press the button themselves, but... used it for their armed struggle with the aim of destroying an aircraft."" The four suspects on trial are Russian nationals Igor Girkin, Sergei Dubinsky and Oleg Pulatov, and Ukrainian citizen Leonid Kharchenko. All four have refused to appear in court in the Netherlands and are being tried in absentia. In three days of hearings this week, the prosecution are formally charging the four suspects and will set out their sentencing demands. A verdict at the high-security court, near Amsterdam's Schiphol airport where MH17 took off on its doomed flight to Kuala Lumpur, is not expected until late 2022 at the earliest. ""The maximum penalty is life imprisonment,"" a court spokesperson told AFP. The hearings come as fresh tensions soar over Ukraine, with the West accusing Moscow of planning an invasion. Girkin, 49, also known by his pseudonym ""Strelkov,"" is the most high-profile suspect — a former Russian spy and historical re-enactment fan who helped kickstart the war in Ukraine. Dubinsky, 57, who has also been linked with Russian intelligence, allegedly served as the separatists' military intelligence chief. Pulatov, 53, was an ex-Russian special forces soldier and one of Dubinsky's deputies. Kharchenko, 48, allegedly led a separatist unit in eastern Ukraine. Pulatov is the only suspect to be represented by lawyers. Prosecutors will spend Monday and Tuesday explaining evidence including telephone and electronic eavesdropping, the circumstances surrounding the missile, and the defendants themselves. The sentencing demand is expected to follow on Wednesday and will include an ""extensive justification of the requested penalty,"" the spokesperson said. Prosecutors said during the opening of the trial in March 2020 that if the court passed a sentence ""we will do everything in our power to ensure that it is enforced, whether in the Netherlands or elsewhere."" The trial heard harrowing testimony from relatives earlier this year, who spoke of the heartbreak of the loss of children, parents and siblings, and called on ""corrupt"" Russia to provide justice. Kiev has been battling a pro-Moscow insurgency in two breakaway regions bordering Russia since 2014, when the Kremlin annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula. Western nations imposed tough sanctions on Russia amid international outrage over the shooting down of flight MH17. Russia has recently massed troops near Ukraine's borders and the West has for weeks accused it of planning an invasion, warning Moscow of massive sanctions should it launch an attack.

""There are some issues that Russia has raised that we believe we can discuss, and others that they know very well we will never agree to."" The statement comes as fears mount in the West over a major military escalation in Ukraine. The Kremlin has grown increasingly insistent that the West and NATO are encroaching dangerously close to Russia's borders. Moscow presented the West with sweeping security demands last week, saying NATO must not admit new members and barring the United States from establishing new bases in former Soviet countries. The U.S. official added: ""Any dialogue must be based on reciprocity, meaning that we have our own concerns put on the table."" ""We are continuing to watch closely Russia's alarming movement of forces and deployments along the border with Ukraine."" Speaking to reporters in Moscow earlier in the day Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Washington's willingness to discuss Russia's security proposals aimed at curbing NATO's eastward expansion in January in Geneva was ""positive.""

Talks , Warning of  Military Response  to NATO Activity",English,Russia,"Russia demands immediate talks with the United States on security guarantees from NATO, a senior diplomat said Monday, while President Vladimir Putin’s chief arms control negotiator warned of a “military response” if the alliance continues to step on Moscow’s “sore spots.” Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov spoke days after Moscow made public a list of demands that seek to limit the U.S.-led Western military bloc’s role in Ukraine and the former Soviet space. “We need [answers] urgently since the situation is very serious and may get more complicated,” the state-run RIA Novosti news agency quoted Ryabkov as saying. Konstantin Gavrilov, who heads Russia’s delegation on military security and arms control talks in Vienna, echoed Ryabkov’s earlier warning of military action from Moscow in response to what it views as NATO’s threatening activities. “Everyone in NATO understands well that, despite all [its] strength and power, it needs to take concrete political actions,” Gavrilov said in a state television broadcast. “Otherwise the alternative is a military-technical and military response from Russia,” Gavrilov added without elaborating. Ryabkov, meanwhile, said he believes the West will “attempt to turn” Russia’s demands for negotiations “into a sluggish process.” The United States has responded to Russia’s demands for urgent talks by maintaining that it would not negotiate without input from Europe. The EU has rejected Russia’s bid to block Ukraine’s NATO ambitions. European officials have in recent days signaled a willingness to negotiate with Moscow, however. “We need to solve the current tensions on the diplomatic level,” the Financial Times quoted Germany’s new defense minister Christine Lambrecht as saying. “We will discuss Russia’s proposals . . . But it cannot be that Russia dictates to Nato partners their posture, and that is something that we will make very clear,” she said on a Sunday visit to German troops stationed in Lithuania — troops that Russia would like to see removed. “We will discuss these proposals that are currently on the table ... with all our partners in the EU and in NATO,” FT quoted German foreign ministry spokeswoman Andrea Sasse as saying. “It is important that in our dialogue that we have [with Russia] at the moment, we remain true to our own principles. And one of them is the indivisibility of the security of all NATO member states. And that has consequences for what we can and can’t accept.” In its list of demands published Friday, Russia demanded that the U.S. not establish any new military bases in ex-Soviet countries and that NATO guarantee to block these states' future memberships. Russia also wants NATO to abandon all military activities in Ukraine, Eastern Europe, the Caucasus region and Central Asia. Additionally, Russia wants NATO to pledge not to deploy troops in former-communist member states Poland, the Czech Republic and the Baltics without Moscow’s consent. Following Ryabkov's comments, the Kremlin announced that Putin will on Tuesday host an expanded Defense Ministry board meeting where it said the president will set out priorities for Russia’s Army and Navy. With the West watching Putin’s every move over fears of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, the military gathering will include the heads of each military branch, regional military districts, fleets and flotillas, as well as formations and military units. The top brass gathering will “evaluate the Russian Armed Forces’ activities in 2021 and set tasks and priorities for their further development next year,” the Kremlin said.",1,561,89.52,67.23,16.06,22.45,24.39,31.37,79.32,54.37,42.07,8.02,3.03,0,1.96,0,0.36,0.53,4.99,12.83,7.13,0.36,14.44,4.63,2.32,5.7,0.89,10.7,5.35,1.96,11.94,3.74,0.36,7.84,9.8,1.07,8.73,1.25,1.96,1.96,0.71,0.36,2.67,0,3.03,1.6,1.43,0.71,0.36,0.36,0.18,0,0,0,13.37,7.49,0.53,0.18,0.36,0,5.7,6.24,0,0,0.36,0.36,8.2,6.77,1.25,0.18,2.14,0.18,0,1.78,0.18,0,0.89,0.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.89,0.36,0.89,0,0,0.18,0,1.25,0,2.14,8.2,0.71,0.71,5.88,0.53,0.18,0.36,4.46,2.5,4.1,2.5,0,0,0,0,0,20.32,5.7,4.99,0,0,3.39,6.24

Barely a week after Annalena Baerbock was sworn in as Germany’s new foreign minister, she had to expel two Russian diplomats after a Berlin court found a Russian FSB agent guilty of a 2019 “murder by state contract” in the city’s central Tiergarten park. Meanwhile, many of new chancellor Olaf Scholz’s meetings in his first week in office were at least partly dedicated to Russia’s unprecedented amassing of troops at Ukraine’s borders, and to Europe’s reaction. It’s no surprise that Moscow is testing the mettle of the longtime German chancellor Angela Merkel’s successor — and the EU’s readiness to stand firm in its Eastern Neighborhood. The timing is perfect for the Russian leadership to relegate the EU to the back seat of talks on European security: a new coalition has just been formed in Berlin, French President Emmanuel Macron is up for reelection in the spring, and a direct bilateral U.S.-Russian channel was recently established for strategic stability talks. The Normandy format (France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine) suffered a serious blow last month when the Russian Foreign Ministry published confidential letters it had exchanged with German and French diplomats. Moscow is taking advantage of the situation and demanding to discuss European security directly with the United States as the only actor the Russian leadership takes seriously and feels equivalent to — knowing full well that Washington’s priority is China. The publication of a proposed U.S.-Russian treaty drafted by Moscow, including a number of unrealistic demands regarding European security, casts doubt on Russia’s seriousness about parleying, especially given the backdrop of the open military threat to Ukraine. Under these circumstances, Germany’s traditional approach of engagement with Moscow is becoming increasingly difficult to pursue, especially in a three-party coalition with diverging approaches to Russia. Despite Russia’s violations of the European security order, Germany has always been a supporter of continuous engagement with Moscow. Although then Russian president Dmitry Medvedev’s proposals for a new European security order from 2009 were met with skepticism, Merkel and her foreign policy advisor Christoph Heusgen devised the “Meseberg initiative” in response. When deterrence measures became necessary, Germany advocated for respecting existing agreements, such as the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act, and preferred to station rotating troops rather than permanent ones in eastern NATO member states. This approach often caused frustration among the Eastern Neighbors, whose warnings ahead of the 2008 war in Georgia, the annexation of Crimea in 2014, and the war in Donbas were perceived as unfounded prophecies of doom in Berlin—until the nightmarish wake-up call of 2014. Underestimating Russia’s willingness to act militarily is not a mistake Germany will make twice. But it now lacks the counterpart for the diplomatic engagement it had in the past, as Moscow is showing no willingness to engage in talks with Berlin on European security. At the same time, the new-old Russia policy of the so-called “traffic light coalition” of the Social Democratic Party, the Free Democratic Party, and the Green Party is still in the making and reflects the different approaches of the three parties. After intense discussions on the best approach to Russia (between the normative approach backed by the Greens and to some extent the Free Democrats, and the engagement-oriented approach backed by the Social Democrats), a language was found that is deemed satisfactory to all. While it is still sharper than the language of previous coalition agreements, some differences remain. The focus on human rights and the rejection of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline by the Green Party is difficult to square with the Social Democrats’ legacy of Willy Brandt’s Ostpolitik and support for the pipeline. Furthermore, the question of a credible security policy toward Russia remains on the table: Green Party leader Robert Habeck has been fiercely criticized for his support of defensive weapon deliveries to Ukraine. Although the Greens have moved toward the center in terms of security policy, skepticism of the traditional concept of deterrence remains, just as it does in the left wing of the Social Democrats. How to deal with the Nord Stream 2 pipeline in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine will be the litmus test for the new coalition to prove that its Russia policy is more than the sum of its parts. In the last two years, Moscow has managed to strengthen its position in the neighborhood, particularly in Belarus and in the South Caucasus, and to put the European gas market under significant pressure. Now, on the 30th anniversary of the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Russian leadership is trying to underpin and substantiate its claim for influence in Ukraine. Germany and its new coalition government will have to adapt Berlin’s traditional approach of engagement to provide a credible response to Russia’s military threats.

The “unprecedented” U.S. export control measures are expected to be discussed at a White House meeting Tuesday. Washington will also reportedly closely coordinate its steps with key European and Asian partners that could be affected and encourage coordinated steps where appropriate. The tough sanctions would “halt Russia’s ability to import smartphones, key aircraft and automobile components, and materials from many other sectors,” according to Reuters. “They could have a major impact on Russian consumers, industrial operations, and employment,” the news agency cited the Biden administration official as saying. The reported export controls would mark a step beyond possible economic sanctions which the U.S. has already warned of. Earlier this month, U.S. President Joe Biden warned Russian leader Vladimir Putin that Moscow would be hit with sanctions “like none he’s ever seen” should it invade Ukraine. Moscow denies planning to launch an invasion against Ukraine following weeks of alarm in the West over Russian troop buildup near Kiev's borders. Instead, Russian officials accuse U.S.-led NATO of threatening the country’s security with military exercises, weapons deployment and expansion near Russia’s western borders.

Both markets beat previous records from October, also struck on demand worries for the northern hemisphere winter months. They are currently about seven times greater than at the start of 2021. Runaway spot gas prices, alongside other buoyant commodities including crude oil, have fuelled mounting concern about spiking inflation worldwide. European gas ""continued its inexorable rise... to another record,"" wrote Deutsche Bank analysts in a client note. ""It comes as temperatures have continued to decline heading into the European winter, and we also got the news that [Russian energy giant] Gazprom had not booked any extra capacity in January for gas flowing through Ukraine."" ""That's an important story heading through the winter with implications for European growth, and one that will have investors closely following the weather forecasts to work out what might happen."" Europe's gas stocks had already been depleted by a prolonged winter last year. Added to the picture, calmer prevailing weather conditions have this year sharply reduced the supply of wind power. Some analysts blame the market spike on ongoing controversy surrounding Russia's planned Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.

The ill-fated flight heading for Kuala Lumpur took off from Amsterdam's Schipol airport in July 2014, and prosecutors this week launched closing arguments in the closely-watched trial. A verdict is not expected until late 2022 at the earliest. The four suspects on trial are Russian nationals Igor Girkin, Sergei Dubinsky and Oleg Pulatov, and Ukrainian citizen Leonid Kharchenko, accused of launching the BUK missile that hit the plane over war-torn eastern Ukraine. ""We are asking that the suspects Girkin, Dubinsky, Pulatov and Kharchenko, each for their responsibility of crashing a plane leading to the death and murder of 298 people, be sentenced to life in prison,"" prosecutor Manon Ridderbeks told the court Wednesday. All four have refused to appear in court in the Netherlands and are being tried in absentia. Prosecutors have argued this week that the four suspects played pivotal roles in securing the BUK system, which was most likely intended to strike a Ukrainian warplane. International investigators say the BUK missile was originally brought from a Russian military base, ostensibly to be used in the fight against Ukrainian forces. ""If we consider how much time the defendants put into planning and organising the deployment of the BUK, it is all the more poignant how little attention they appear to gave given to the risk of inadvertently shooting down a passenger aircraft,"" prosecutors argued, according to trial documents Wednesday. ""In legal terms, the defendants were civilians and were therefore not allowed to shoot at any aircraft, whether civilian or military."" The hearings come as fresh tensions soar over Ukraine, with the West accusing Moscow of planning an invasion. Kiev has been battling a pro-Moscow insurgency in two breakaway regions bordering Russia since 2014, when the Kremlin annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula. Russia has recently massed troops near Ukraine's borders and the West has for weeks accused it of planning an invasion, warning Moscow of massive sanctions should it launch an attack. Moscow denies the claims, with President Vladimir Putin seeking talks with U.S. counterpart Joe Biden and security guarantees to stand down his troops. Western nations imposed tough sanctions on Russia amid international outrage over the shooting down of flight MH17. The best known of the suspects, 49-year-old Girkin — nicknamed ""gunner"" — was one of the main separatist commanders at the start of the conflict with the Ukrainian army five years ago. He said Wednesday he was not surprised by the prosecutors' request, and denied the rebels shot down the plane. ""If they could have sentenced me to death, they would have done it, no doubt about it,"" he was quoted as saying by Russia's Interfax news agency. Dubinsky, 57, is said to be linked to Russian military intelligence, while Poulatov, 53, is a former member of the Russian special forces and Dubinsky's deputy. Khartchenko, 48, is believed to have led a separatist unit in eastern Ukraine. Prosecutors said during the opening of the trial in March 2020 that if the court passed a sentence ""we will do everything in our power to ensure that it is enforced, whether in the Netherlands or elsewhere."" The trial heard harrowing testimony from relatives earlier this year who spoke of the heartbreak of the loss of children, parents and siblings, and called on ""corrupt"" Russia to provide justice.",1,576,96.64,51.44,50.79,1,26.18,30.9,80.21,55.03,45.14,5.21,2.43,0.17,0.69,0,0.69,0.69,2.78,14.24,9.72,3.3,15.97,6.08,1.39,4.69,0.69,11.63,4.17,3.13,9.38,1.74,1.04,6.77,8.68,0.52,8.16,2.43,1.91,0.52,1.22,0.52,2.6,0,6.25,0.87,5.21,1.04,0,0.87,0,0.69,0.17,0,11.28,6.25,0,0.17,2.43,1.04,2.95,4.69,0.52,0,0,0.69,3.82,2.26,1.56,0,0.69,0.17,0,0.52,0,0,0.69,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.69,0,0,0.17,0.35,0,0,0,0.87,0.17,2.95,11.63,0.87,2.26,8.16,0.35,0.17,0.17,3.82,5.9,2.6,1.22,0,0,0,0,0,15.28,4.17,6.25,0,0,1.04,3.82

German authorities are waiting for the pipeline's Swiss-based ""Nord Stream 2 AG"" operating company to submit documents to restart the certification process, BNetzA president Jochen Homann told a press conference. The pipeline would then also have to be approved by the European Commission, he said, ""which means that decisions on this will not be made in the first half of the year"". Nord Stream 2 was completed in September but BNetzA suspended the German approval process in November, saying it needed to become compliant with German law before it could be certified.

Due to Covid-19 restrictions, media outlets were not able to apply for accreditation to the event for the first time since it was first held in 2001. Instead, the Kremlin hand-picked around 500 international and domestic journalists to participate. A number of critical independent outlets, including Novaya Gazeta — whose chief editor shared the Nobel Peace Prize this year — said they received no invite. In addition to the Ukraine crisis, journalists questioned Putin on topics ranging from Russia's crackdown on civil society and the coronavirus pandemic’s effect on the economy to his relationship with Russian Santa Claus in the nearly four-hour event. Here are the key topics he addressed: Several questions were dedicated to the situation with Ukraine, with Putin railing against Kiev and its Western allies for causing the recent surge in tensions and demanding that the West give Russia security guarantees “right now.” But he expressed optimism toward talks with Washington on Moscow’s series of proposed security guarantees that seek to shut NATO out of much of the post-Soviet world. He called the current negotiations with the U.S. “positive” and hinted at fresh direct talks in Geneva in the new year, saying: “The ball is in their court.” The West accuses Russia of plotting to invade Ukraine, which has been battling pro-Moscow separatists in its eastern Donbass region since 2014. Asked about the situation with Ukraine and whether a war was realistic, Putin replied that Russia was responding to threats from Kiev. He called the 2014 Maidan Revolution a “bloody coup d’etat” and accused Ukrainian “extremists” of planning operations to retake Crimea and the Donbass. “We must think about the prospects of our own security. We have to keep an eye on what is happening in Ukraine, and on when they might attack,” he says. Putin referred emotionally to the plight of Donbass’ inhabitants and stressed that the region’s residents alone should determine its future, adding that Russia was ready to act as a mediator to ""create a better future for the people living there.” Putin claimed that Ukraine “refuses to talk” to Donbass representatives and pointed a finger at Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who he said rose to power on promises to end the war and implement the Minsk Accords but had since “come under the influence of radical elements.” In response to a question about Moscow’s tensions with the West, Putin said his country’s actions will not depend on talks with the U.S. on his proposed security guarantees, but on the “unconditional provision of Russia's security.” He stressed that NATO’s expansion to the east was “unacceptable” and continued to slam the U.S., which he said “brazenly lied” about NATO’s “five waves of expansion.” “The U.S. is placing rockets at our doorstep... How would the U.S. react if we delivered rockets near their borders with Canada or Mexico?” he said. With the second year of the pandemic coming to a close and Russia’s excess death toll among the highest in the world, the coronavirus was a constant presence through the press conference. Putin bemoaned Russia’s low vaccination rate — currently at around 45% of adults after a year-long vaccination campaign — and blamed it for the country’s Covid-19 death rate, itself one of the world’s highest. Polls have shown that a consistent, though decreasing, majority of Russians are suspicious of the vaccine and do not plan to inoculate themselves. However, Putin reiterated his long-standing opposition to vaccine mandates, saying that those reluctant to vaccinate should be treated “respectfully” and have the issue “explained” to them. Nonetheless, the president singled out critics of vaccination, who he accused of using the issue to bolster their public profile and of being “dishonest.” Russia’s Communist Party opposition has been leveraging anti-vaccine and anti-lockdown sentiment into a modest increase in its own opinion polling in recent months. The first few questions of the press conference were dedicated to Russia’s economy, which has recovered to its pre-coronavirus state but has slowed in recent months. Putin said Russia had recovered better from the pandemic compared to many developed countries, listed off a number of economic statistics and said he expected real incomes — which are around 10% lower than they were in 2013 — to rise by 3.5% this year. But he listed growing inflation and the country’s demographic situation as major challenges facing the economy. Inflation is currently at a six-year high of 8.4% and he said Russian business figures complain to him every day about the high interest rates introduced by the Central Bank to tame price risis. However, he defended the Central Bank’s policy and its independence. “You can ‘scold’ the Central Bank for raising rates — as representatives of the real economy do, not on camera, but at meetings with me — but if you do not do this, it will be like in Turkey,” Putin said, referring to the Turkish lira’s extreme volatility in recent weeks after its Central Bank cut interest rates despite high inflation. The president also said Gazprom was not to blame for record gas prices in Europe and called on countries to sign long-term agreements with the Russian state-controlled gas company if it wants to ensure stable supplies at fixed prices. “With long-term contracts, prices are three, four, or even seven times cheaper,” Putin says. Europe has in recent years moved towards shorter-term agreements which give more flexibility, but require buying more gas at market prices. “I see these accusations that Gazprom has not booked extra capacity on the Yamal-Europe route. This is because buyers have not made any purchase orders.” Putin repeated his long-standing disdain of Western “liberal” values and defended so-called “traditional values” in response to a question from the state-run RT broadcaster on cancel culture and the controversy surrounding ""Harry Potter” author J.K. Rowling’s comments on transgender people. “I adhere to the traditional approach — a woman is a woman, a man is a man, a mother is a mother, a father is a father,” Putin said, adding that he hoped that Russians had enough defenses against gender-fluid ""obscurantism.” In his answer, Putin said cancel culture was ""like the coronavirus,” with new variants frequently appearing,” adding that following traditional values was Russia’s proposed “antidote.” Putin urged Western governments to “turn a page” on jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny’s poisoning and sought civil society’s help in investigating torture cases across Russian prisons. He claimed without evidence that Western countries have failed to provide proof of Navalny’s August 2020 poisoning with the Novichok nerve agent in Siberia. “Give us a reason to open a criminal case. But if there’s nothing to answer, let’s turn this page,” Putin said. “That Novichok or whatever it is — at least give us [samples],” Putin said. Putin hinted that Navalny serves “foreign interests” that he compared to figures who “destroyed” the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union “from the inside,” and accused the activist of using politics as a “shield” from his criminal conviction. Navalny returned to Russia in early 2021, where he was promptly sentenced to 2.5 years in prison for violating parole while in recovery abroad. When asked about Russia's labeling of independent media and NGOs as ""foreign agents"" this year, he said that such legislation originated in the U.S. in the 1930s and claimed that Russia's ""foreign agents"" law is more liberal than its Western equivalents. Putin also addressed the high-profile video leaks showing alleged rape and torture inside Russia’s prison system that drew nationwide attention this year. After claiming that prison torture also exists in the United States and France, Putin said Russian authorities have opened 17 criminal cases following the torture leaks. “It should be clear to everyone that punishment for these offenses is inevitable,” he said, adding that the investigations “should of course use the capabilities of civil society.” In addition to the host of reporters from domestic media, Putin took questions from British, Italian, Kazakh, Chinese and Belarusian outlets. In answers to the latter three, he stressed Russia’s strong, friendly economic and cultural relations with their respective countries. To an Italian reporter, Putin said that despite Italy’s membership in NATO and the EU, he hoped for ongoing cooperation with the country in various spheres. Meanwhile, he slammed a reporter from Britain’s Sky News for what he said was the West’s hostile foreign policy toward Russia. When asked about Russia’s relations with the new Taliban regime in Afghanistan, he did not say whether Russia would recognize the new government in Kabul, but said he hoped the situation in the country would be stable and warned against the penetration of extremists into the bordering Central Asian republics. He also called on the West to unfreeze Afghanistan’s financial assets, saying the country is on the brink of a widespread humanitarian crisis. Putin also discussed closer integration with Belarus and its embattled leader Alexander Lukashenko. Moscow and Minsk are working on a number of proposals to closer integrate the two countries, as Russia has become Belarus’ key financial and political supporter amid widespread international isolation of the Lukashenko regime over the past year. “We are building a ‘Union State,’” Putin said, but noted that the level of integration between Russia and Belarus was “at a much lower level than that in the European Union. It’s incomparable.” In an unexpected turn of events, Putin was asked about his relationship with Father Frost ⁠— the Russian version of Santa Claus. The question was asked by a journalist based in Veliky Ustyug ⁠— a town in northwest Russia that is home to the mythical figure. Putin thanked Father Frost for having helped him become president and urged the mythical figure to help carry out Moscow's plans. ""My relationship with Father Frost has always developed in a good way,"" Putin said. ""I am grateful to him that I can meet with you in my capacity…I can advocate for Father Frost and remind the plaintiff that Father Frost only fulfils the wishes of boys and girls who have been good.""",1,1680,92.5,53.57,27.48,8.55,25.45,28.45,82.32,60.24,45.89,8.21,4.35,0.48,0.54,0.18,2.32,0.54,3.87,13.93,8.45,1.73,16.19,5.3,2.5,5.54,0.65,11.61,6.85,3.63,5.71,1.96,0.71,3.04,9.64,0.3,9.35,1.96,1.31,0.95,1.43,0.54,3.63,0.06,5.18,1.9,3.15,1.31,0.48,0.71,0.24,0.12,0,0.06,14.52,7.44,0.77,0.12,1.25,0.77,3.69,6.37,0.54,0,0.3,2.98,3.93,2.68,1.25,0,3.21,0.06,0.12,1.9,1.49,0,1.61,1.13,1.01,0,0,0,0.06,0,0.12,0.42,0.3,0.36,0,0.18,0,0.06,0.6,0.12,3.33,9.52,0.36,0.83,7.98,0.36,0,0.18,3.21,4.88,3.04,1.37,0.12,0.12,0.06,0,0,18.87,5.06,4.17,0.06,0,2.44,7.14

NATO member Turkey has irritated Moscow by supplying combat drones to Ukraine that Russia fears could be used by Kiev in its conflict with separatists in two eastern regions. But Turkey has also upset Washington and NATO by acquiring an advanced missile defense system from Russia that resulted in sanctions from the United States. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu urged Moscow and the Western defense alliance to air their differences in direct negotiations proposed by NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg. Russia wants NATO to provide Moscow with a binding security guarantee and withdraw its forces to positions they held before a wave of eastward expansion that began after the Soviet Union's collapse. ""For any proposal to be accepted, it should be acceptable by both sides. Russia made some proposals. But maybe NATO seeks the same kind of guarantees from Russia. This is not a one-sided issue,"" Cavusoglu told reporters. ""If the requests are maximalist — I’m not saying that Russia is maximalist in any case — both sides must be constructive,"" he said. ""They should come to the table with proposals that both sides can accept."" A NATO spokesman said the Brussels-based alliance had been ""in touch"" with Moscow about holding a meeting of the NATO-Russia Council on Jan. 12. Russia has not yet formally accepted the offer. ""If Russia has any certain specific expectation or issue from Turkey regarding reducing tensions between Russia and NATO, Turkey will evaluate this positively because our objective is clear,"" said Cavusoglu.

Broadcaster RT — previously known as Russia Today — said on its website that YouTube had taken down its newly launched ""Auf Sendung"" (On Air) channel ""without explanation"". The 24/7 channel can still be viewed on other platforms, including on the RT DE website. A YouTube spokesperson told AFP that the channel was removed for trying to circumvent its earlier termination of RT's German channels RT DE and Der Fehlende Part. ""When a channel is terminated, the uploader is not allowed to use, own or create any other YouTube channels,"" the spokesperson said. ""As a result of this circumvention attempt, the new channel 'RT auf Sendung' was permanently removed for violating YouTube's terms of service."" Google-owned YouTube in September issued a warning to RT DE for violating its coronavirus disinformation guidelines and then shuttered two channels for breaching user terms. The move angered Moscow, which accused YouTube of ""censorship"" and said the ban was likely aided by German authorities at a time of strained diplomatic ties between the two countries. Berlin denied the claim and said it had ""nothing to do with"" YouTube's decision. The latest YouTube spat comes as tensions are running high between Russia and Germany, a day after a Berlin court sentenced a Russian to life in jail over a 2019 assassination on German soil it says was ordered by Moscow. The ruling prompted Germany to expel two Russian diplomats. Germany has also echoed Western alarm about Russia's troop movements on the border with Ukraine, with new chancellor Olaf Scholz warning on Wednesday that Russia would pay ""a high price"" for invading Ukraine. Launched in 2005 as ""Russia Today"", state-funded RT has expanded with broadcasters and websites in languages including English, French, Spanish and Arabic. It has generated controversy in many countries, including the United States, where it was required to register as a ""foreign agent"", and in Britain, where authorities have threatened to revoke its broadcasting licence.

The Roskomnadzor media regulator confirmed Saturday that it had blocked OVD-Info's website because the Moscow region court had ruled that the group's activities were aimed at promoting ""terrorism and extremism"" in Russia. Troops withdrawn Russia announced Saturday that more than 10,000 troops had finished month-long drills near Ukraine, amid Western accusations that Moscow was plotting an invasion of its ex-Soviet neighbor. The Defense Ministry said in a statement that the drills for Southern Military District forces had taken place in a host of southern regions including Rostov, Krasnodar and Crimea, the latter of which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014. NATO sit-down NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has sought a meeting of the NATO-Russia Council next month and contacted Moscow to secure its attendance, an alliance spokesman said Sunday. ""We are in touch with Russia"" about the Jan. 12 meeting, the first proposed by Stoltenberg since Moscow made its sweeping security demands, said the NATO spokesman, who asked not be identified. Russia’s Foreign Ministry said it was considering NATO’S proposal to meet on Jan. 12. Gas games Russian energy giant Gazprom has rejected accusations that Moscow is limiting gas deliveries to Europe via the Yamal-Europe pipeline and denounced Germany's resale of gas to Poland amid soaring prices. The pipeline was operating in reverse mode this week, public data showed, sending gas from Germany to Poland as European gas prices ticked up.

More Positively Despite Soaring Tensions – Poll,English,Russia,"Russians are more likely to have a positive view of the United States than view it negatively, according to a new independent survey published Thursday. Despite soaring geopolitical tensions, the Levada Center pollster's latest survey marks the first time in three years that Russians reported an overall favorable attitude toward the U.S. According to Levada, 45% of Russian respondents said they view the U.S. positively compared with 42% who view the U.S. negatively. Another 13% did not answer. “For the first time since July 2018, the share of respondents who view the U.S. positively exceeded the share of those who view it negatively,” Levada said. Russians’ attitudes toward the U.S. have improved significantly since spring 2021, when just 31% said they held a favorable view of the country. Levada also saw Russians growing more positive toward the European Union, with favorability growing from 38% in May to 48% in November. The EU’s unfavorable rating has also decreased from 45% to 38% over the same period. This change in attitudes comes amid heightened tensions between Moscow and Washington, with the U.S saying it fears Russia could be ramping up to invade Ukraine early next year. Russia denies planning an invasion and accuses U.S.-led NATO of threatening its security with eastward expansion and weapons deployment near its borders.

Lavrov said plans were in place for those talks to be followed by negotiations between Russia and NATO, saying ""we also want to do this in January."" On Wednesday the European Union appealed to the U.S. and NATO to defend its interests, saying in a statement: ""Today, Europe's security is under threat."" Later, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and EU High Representative Josep Borrell spoke to discuss Russia's proposals.

Became  Arrogant  After Fall of Soviet Union – Gorbachev,English,Russia,"Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev said Friday that Washington grew ""arrogant and self-confident"" after the collapse of the Soviet Union, leading to the expansion of the NATO military alliance. In recent years President Vladimir Putin has grown increasingly insistent that NATO is encroaching close to Russia's borders, and Moscow last week demanded ""legal guarantees"" that the U.S.-led alliance will halt its eastward expansion. ""How can one count on equal relations with the United States and the West in such a position?"" Gorbachev told state news agency RIA Novosti on the eve of the anniversary of his resignation as the leader of the U.S.S.R. He noted the ""triumphant mood in the West, especially in the United States"" after the Soviet Union ceased to exist in 1991. ""They grew arrogant and self-confident. They declared victory in the Cold War,"" Gorbachev, 90, said. He insisted that it was ""together"" that Moscow and Washington pulled the world out of confrontation and the nuclear race. ""No, the 'winners' decided to build a new empire. Hence the idea of NATO expansion,"" Gorbachev added. However, he welcomed upcoming security talks between Moscow and Washington. ""I hope there will be a result,"" he said. Last week Moscow presented the West with sweeping security demands, saying NATO must not admit new members and seeking to bar the United States from establishing new bases in former Soviet countries. Putin said Thursday that Washington has been willing to discuss the proposals and talks could happen at the start of next year in Geneva. A senior U.S. official said Washington was ready for talks ""as soon as early January.""

They make the following direct demands of the U.S.: “The United States of America shall undertake to prevent further eastward expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and deny accession to the Alliance to the States of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The United States of America shall not establish military bases in the territory of the States of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics that are not members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, use their infrastructure for any military activities or develop bilateral military cooperation with them.” The agreement that Russia proposes to sign with NATO includes obligations that the Alliance exclude further expansion, including the accession of Ukraine, as well as other states, and refuse to conduct “any military activity on the territory of Ukraine, as well as other states of Eastern Europe, Transcaucasia and Central Asia”. Elsewhere, the document calls for a halt to activities that might be perceived as threatening security. “The Parties shall refrain from deploying their armed forces and armaments, including in the framework of international organizations, military alliances or coalitions, in the areas where such deployment could be perceived by the other Party as a threat to its national security, with the exception of such deployment within the national territories of the Parties.” In other words, NATO cannot carry out military activity near Russia’s borders although Russia, on its territory near NATO’s borders, has the right to do as it sees fit. All this simply restates what Moscow has long set out as its position and demands — most actively so in the last several weeks. The real question is why Russian leaders decided to put forward such a document knowing full well that their Western counterparts would reject it and refuse to even discuss its provisions. For the U.S. and NATO, agreeing would mean taking the politically unacceptable step of capitulating to Moscow. Also, why would the West suddenly feel the need for such a revolutionary revision to the post-Cold War system of European security? Simply put, there is not enough of a threat to consider such drastic measures. Moscow, presumably, understands this, indicating that it might have a different goal in mind: to obtain a refusal of its empty gesture so that it can say, “We offered and so we’re not to blame for what we do next”. In other words, the Kremlin is creating a pretext by which it can freely revise the existing system of relations — a step for which it apparently feels the time has come. If this is the case, we can expect Moscow to take steps demonstrating Russia’s determination to unilaterally change the status quo. And, because the scale of the proposals does not allow for simply accepting a refusal from the West and postponing the demands until the next round of diplomatic talks — that would undermine the credibility of the demands — the interesting thing now will be to see what the Kremlin does if it receives the negative response from the West that it apparently sought from the beginning.",1,537,93.43,28.77,40.25,18.04,33.56,28.68,85.29,63.31,52.89,7.64,1.68,0,0.74,0,0,0.93,5.96,18.62,11.36,0.19,16.57,5.96,3.91,5.96,1.12,10.8,6.7,2.42,8.94,2.79,0.56,5.59,12.48,0.19,12.29,2.05,1.49,1.86,2.05,0.74,4.47,0,4.66,2.23,2.42,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.01,5.77,1.12,0.19,1.68,0.37,1.3,2.79,0,0,0,0,7.82,7.08,0.74,0,2.05,0.56,0,1.3,0,0.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.19,0,0.93,0.56,0.19,0,0.19,1.49,0.37,2.98,11.17,0.37,1.3,8.19,0.74,0,0.37,2.61,0.93,4.1,1.86,0,0,0,0,0,11.73,3.91,4.84,0.19,0,0.74,2.05

Lavrov repeated President Vladimir Putin’s scathing criticisms of what Moscow perceives as threatening steps by the West, including NATO expansion eastward. Russia this month issued a series of sweeping security demands to the United States that include NATO withdrawing forces to positions held before the alliance's wave of eastward expansion following the Soviet collapse and banning Ukraine from joining NATO. Lavrov’s hour-long interview on Solovyov’s YouTube channel was published on the same day that the White House announced Russia-U.S. talks on European security on Jan. 10. “Russia can put its concerns on the table and we will put our concerns on the table with Russia’s activities as well,” an unnamed White House official was quoted by AFP as saying. Russia-NATO talks are then expected on Jan. 12, followed by talks with OSCE, Europe’s top security organization which includes the U.S., on Jan. 13. The diplomatic talks will pick up following weeks of Western warnings that Russia is amassing tens of thousands of troops on the Ukrainian border with the possible aim of invading the neighboring country.

Prosecutors have asked the court to dissolve Memorial's Human Rights Center, which campaigns for political prisoners and other disadvantaged groups, for alleged failures to use the ""foreign agent"" label on all their publications and for justifying terrorism. As the Moscow City Court reconvened to hear the case, dozens of supporters gathered outside and observers were not allowed inside amid the coronavirus outbreak. Speaking in court, the prosecutors said Memorial's failure to properly mark its materials could harm Russians' ""psychological health"" and cause depression. The prosecution also said that the group's website contained information ""justifying terrorism and extremism,"" adding that it ""negatively affects children."" The trial comes in a year that witnessed an unprecedented crackdown on opponents of President Vladimir Putin, including the jailing of top opposition politician Alexei Navalny. But the move to shutter Russia's top rights group stands out and would have been unimaginable a few years ago. Authorities have also brought another case against Memorial International, the group's central structure, which is also accused of violating the ""foreign agent"" law. Next week, Russia's Supreme Court is set to re-convene to hear the case against Memorial International. The two cases are the largest threat to the organization's existence since it was founded in 1989 by rights activists including renowned scientist and Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov. They bookend a year that has seen authorities launch an unprecedented crackdown on the opposition and independent media, imprisoning Navalny in February and banning his organizations. The pressure on Memorial has led to a major outcry in Russia and the West. The Memorial Human Rights Center releases lists of people it says are political prisoners, including Navalny and members of religious minorities such as the Jehovah's Witnesses that have been outlawed in Russia. In October, the organization said there were at least 420 political prisoners in Russia, noting that their number had risen sharply this year. As well as political prisoners, the center also campaigns for groups facing pressure from authorities, including migrants and members of the LGBTQ community. ""Essentially we are doing what prosecutors should be doing, we are helping them,"" Memorial representative Alexander Cherkasov said in court. ""Our work is needed and important,"" he added. Activists have called on Putin to intervene, but he told his human rights council that Memorial had been advocating on behalf of ""terrorist and extremist organizations."" Memorial International coordinates the work of dozens of organizations across Russia. Russia's two living Nobel Peace Prize winners — the last Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Novaya Gazeta newspaper editor Dmitry Muratov — have urged prosecutors to withdraw their claims. ""Memorial is not an 'enemy of the people,'"" Muratov said in his Nobel acceptance speech in Oslo this month. ""Memorial is a friend of the people."" In another case next week, a court in the northwestern city of Petrozavodsk will deliver its ruling on Memorial employee Yury Dmitriyev, a historian the organization says is being targeted for his work exposing the horrors of the Soviet era. Sentenced last year to 13 years in prison on what his supporters say were fabricated child sex charges, he faces two additional years in prison. Memorial, which has become a symbol of post-Soviet democratization, has created a huge archive of Soviet-era crimes. The trial against it coincides with the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Soviet Union marked later this month.",1,585,93.82,61.39,14.57,1.63,22.5,32.14,81.71,55.04,43.59,6.84,2.74,0,0.51,0,1.37,0.85,4.1,15.04,9.06,1.54,14.53,6.5,1.54,4.44,0.51,11.45,5.3,4.1,10.43,1.71,1.71,7.18,5.81,0.17,5.64,0.51,1.71,0.85,0.17,0,2.56,0,5.47,1.2,4.27,0.34,0,0.34,0.17,0,0.17,0,12.14,5.81,0.17,0,1.03,1.37,2.39,6.15,0,0,0,1.37,4.96,3.76,1.03,0.17,3.25,0,0,2.91,0,0.34,3.59,0.51,0.17,0,0.17,0,0.34,0,2.39,0.17,0,0.51,0,0,0,0.34,0.34,0.34,3.42,8.21,0,1.03,6.84,0.17,0.51,0,3.59,5.3,3.08,0.17,0,0,0,0,0,14.87,4.44,4.27,0,0,2.22,3.93

The movie — whose trailer says is dedicated to “our Russian guys” — depicts the real-life events involving Russian mercenaries who fought in Mozambique’s northern Cabo Delgado region in 2019, its director Denis Neymand told The Moscow Times. “The movie was completely based on a Russian private military company in Mozambique. All of this happened in real life,” said Neymand, who also confirmed that Aurum ordered the production of the movie. The Moscow Times, along with other outlets, earlier reported on how hundreds of Russian soldiers fighting for private military company Wagner were deployed in Mozambique, with at least seven of them killed by the Islamic insurgents. Units of the secretive Wagner group have been seen in several conflict zones, allegedly serving Russian private and state interests in Ukraine, Syria and Libya. The group has recently stepped up its efforts on the African continent, fighting in Mozambique and the Central African Republic, and were reportedly invited to Mali this fall. Neymand said it “wasn’t a secret” during filming that the mercenaries on which the movie is based belonged to the Wagner group. “But we didn’t name them in the movie because it doesn’t really matter which private military company operates there. The movie is about showing how Russian guys help Africans against evil forces,” he said, adding that the movie was filmed in the Central African Republic, where Russia has a military presence. The Kremlin in 2019 denied that Russian soldiers were active in Mozambique, while Prigozhin has repeatedly said he has no links to Wagner and has sued media outlets for reporting his alleged connections to the mercenary group. But a number of recent movies produced by Prigozhin-linked firms, including Aurum and the St. Petersburg-based Paritet Film studio, depict Russian “instructors” fighting in eastern Ukraine and the Central African Republic — places where Wagner fighters have also reported to have been active. These movies — which share much of the same acting crew — appear to shed further light on Prigozhin’s links with Wagner. The EU earlier this month slapped sanctions on the group for destabilizing Ukraine and parts of Africa. Prigozhin was not immediately available for comment. Aurum was also behind the film “The Tourist,” which tells the story of a group of young Russian military advisors sent to CAR on the eve of its 2020 presidential elections. Numerous NGOs as well as independent UN observers say that these instructors are in fact paramilitaries from the Wagner Group. A March report by a group of independent UN experts said Wagner mercenaries have committed human rights abuses in CAR. Aurum additionally holds distribution rights for the film “Shugalei,” a movie also directed by Neymand which claims to tell the true story of Maxim Shugalei, a Russian political operative believed to be close to Prigozhin who has spent time in Libyan prison on accusations of meddling in the country’s internal affairs.",1,534,96.01,47.84,22.98,8.14,25.43,31.84,79.59,54.12,42.32,5.99,2.06,0,0.37,0,0.56,0.37,3.93,13.48,9.18,0.94,15.54,5.06,2.81,3.37,0.94,9.93,6.93,1.87,5.62,1.12,0.56,4.12,6.74,0.37,6.37,0.56,1.12,0,0.94,0.75,3.37,0,2.81,0.75,2.06,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.73,6.37,0.94,0,1.69,0.75,2.43,5.24,0,0,0,0.94,7.12,3.37,3.37,0.37,7.68,3,0,4.12,0.19,0.37,0.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.19,2.06,8.43,0.19,0.37,7.3,0.75,0,0,3,5.81,3.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.23,3.93,4.31,0,0,1.5,4.49

Poland this week accused Moscow of having stopped its deliveries via the Yamal-Europe pipeline that sends Russian gas to Western Europe, accusing Gazprom of ""manipulation"". The pipeline was operating in reverse mode this week, sending gas from Germany to Poland, public data showed, as European gas prices ticked up. President Vladimir Putin on Friday denied that the flow direction was a political move and said that Poland had ""sidelined"" Russia in managing the pipeline. ""All accusations against Russia and Gazprom that we are not supplying enough gas to the European market are absolutely groundless and unacceptable and untrue,"" Gazprom spokesman Sergei Kupriyanov said late Saturday, calling the accusations ""lies"". He said some buyers of Russian gas, in particular Germany and France, have not made additional orders, and slammed the reverse flow of gas that came as ""winter is just beginning"" as ""not the most rational decision."" ""I don't even want to talk about the price of such reverse supplies. These prices are significantly higher than the prices for contract volumes set by Gazprom, he said in an interview on state television. ""All problems in Western Europe have been created by themselves and there is no need to blame Gazprom for this. It is better to look in the mirror."" Western countries have for weeks accused Russia of limiting gas deliveries to put pressure on Europe amid tensions over the Ukraine conflict and to push through the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline set to ship Russian gas to Germany. Germany's energy ministry, for its part, on Sunday poured cold water on accusations of Russia withholding deliveries.

This year, the factory worker, who declined to give his last name, said a spike in prices meant he would have to forego caviar and other treats so he could afford a bottle of bubbly for the countdown on Russia's biggest holiday. People are making sacrifices across the country, with soaring inflation pushing up costs and forcing cash-strapped Russians to make difficult decisions around the holidays. ""Everything is getting more expensive but wages aren't going up,"" said Sergei Borisovich, who was shocked that a loaf of bread now costs 100 rubles ($1.35). President Vladimir Putin has described prices as a key concern and the embattled opposition is hoping to leverage the economic woes. This month, inflation reached its highest since 2016, with rising everyday costs hitting hard a population whose average monthly income is 40,402 rubles ($545). Adding to that, some 43% of Russians do not have any savings, according to a recent survey by recruitment website SuperJob. Sergei Borisovich said the table this year would be topped only with a salad of potatoes and peas. ""I'll buy some Shampanskoye if I can,"" he said referring to sparkling wine popular during the Soviet Union. Red caviar, served with bread and butter on New Year's Eve, is the most expensive it has been since monitoring began in 2000. Ingredients for other holiday dishes like the mayonnaise-rich salad ""Olivier"" are expected to cost 15% more than last year, Russian media has reported citing statistics agency Rosstat. ""Herring Under a Fur Coat"" — a layered dish of pickled herring and beetroot — will set Russians back 25% more than last year. Living standards in Russia have been gradually decreasing since Moscow was slapped with a slew of Western sanctions in 2014 over its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. Now, the dip is accelerating, hitting even those in Moscow, the wealthiest city. Karina Strukova, an engineer on maternity leave, says the trend forced her to stop buying groceries from the upmarket Vkusvill grocery chain in favor of the lower-cost Magnit stores. The 30-year-old told AFP her grocery bill had grown by as much as 25% since last year. ""We're trying to cut back on spending a bit because we don't have any other sources of income,"" she said. ""We're buying fewer gifts and going to cheaper shops."" Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, controversially jailed earlier this year on a fraud charge, said he had even felt the pinch behind bars. He wrote on Instagram that food prices have gone up by at least 40% in under a year at a shop where he is allowed to spend 9,000 rubles ($120) a month to supplement his meals. ""The great inflationary tragedy that pensioners are going through is unfolding before my eyes,"" he wrote. Polls have shown that decreasing purchasing power is a major concern for Russians, affecting trust in authorities and Putin's approval ratings. To curb galloping prices, the government has introduced price caps and export quotas, while the central bank has repeatedly hiked its key interest rate. The Russian leader has described inflation as ""the main problem today for both the economy and citizens"" and instructed officials to pull it back from over 8% to 4% in the coming year. But many causes of inflation are global, stemming from spending on post-pandemic recovery and disruptions in supply chains, said Igor Nikolaev of the Institute for Strategic Analysis at FBK Grant Thornton Russia. The situation is made worse in Russia, he said, where there are not enough actors in the market to push prices down. ""When there isn't enough competition, there's no mechanism preventing producers and sellers from increasing prices,"" Nikolaev added. At the market to buy gifts for her grandchildren, 88-year-old pensioner Svetlana Knyazeva says people can get used to anything. ""I can't say I have a bad life,"" she says, adding that she has a pension of almost 30,000 rubles ($400) a month.",1,676,90.31,50.63,19.16,23.98,23.31,23.82,83.14,58.58,44.38,7.25,4.14,0.74,0.44,0,2.51,0,3.11,13.61,7.54,3.11,15.24,7.25,2.07,4.59,1.04,14.79,6.07,6.51,3.4,0.89,0.59,2.07,8.14,0.44,7.4,1.04,2.07,1.18,0.89,0,1.92,0.15,2.96,1.48,1.18,0.89,0.15,0.44,0,0,0.3,0,9.76,4.14,0.44,0,0.15,0.15,2.66,5.03,0.3,0,1.04,1.63,2.07,0.59,1.04,0.44,9.02,1.04,0,2.81,6.21,0,2.81,0.3,0.15,0,0,0.15,0,2.22,0,0.3,0.15,0.74,1.33,0,0,0,0.3,0,4.88,9.17,0,2.22,6.51,0.44,0.15,0.3,4.59,4.73,5.33,1.48,0,0,0,0,0,19.08,4.44,5.77,0,0,1.63,7.25

But a fresh coronavirus wave in the summer was followed by an even more devastating surge in the fall fueled by the Delta variant, which saw Russia registering record cases in deaths and infections. And while Europe and the U.S. managed to curb their death tolls with the aid of mass vaccination campaigns, Russia was unable to follow suit, in large part due to widespread vaccine skepticism. By December, the country had registered over 900,000 excess fatalities since the start of the year, according to The Moscow Times calculations, and experts believe the number could hit the grim milestone of one million excess deaths by the end of the year. Independent demographers believe that Russia’s natural population  — excluding the effects of migration — has seen its largest decline since World War II. Russia’s leadership admitted in November for the first time during the pandemic that its excess mortality rate ⁠— a measure comparing total fatalities from all causes with a pre-pandemic baseline that is seen by demographers and statisticians as the most reliable indicator of lives lost to the pandemic ⁠— was directly linked to Covid-19. The fourth wave, which started in October, was especially deadly for the country, with hospitals once again overflowing and doctors raising the alarm. In the worst-hit month of October, the country saw 3,000 excess deaths a day. While daily infections and deaths have waned as the year-end approaches, virologists have warned that the country should prepare for new deadly waves in the new year, with the more infectious omicron variant gaining ground in a country where only 40% of the population is fully vaccinated. Vaccine diplomacy backfires As 2021 dawned, Russia, under the direction of its vaccine’s developer the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), was eager to boost the nation’s image through so-called vaccine diplomacy. But Sputnik V’s champions quickly found themselves embroiled in a string of scandals. In Slovakia and Brazil, the nation’s health regulators said they could not evaluate the risks and benefits of the vaccine due to a lack of data and inconsistencies in dosages. Argentina, one of the biggest buyers of Sputnik V, on multiple occasions, complained it was in a “very critical situation” as it faced shortages of second doses, which Russia said were more difficult to produce than the first ones. Guatemala also faced shortages, and in July canceled an order for eight million doses because of previous delays. The Moscow Times also investigated a secret scheme through which the RDIF granted a minor UAE royal exclusive rights to resell Sputnik V to at least five developing countries at a significant mark-up. The scheme led to a series of scandals in Lebanon, Kenya and Pakistan while Ghana’s parliament opened an official hearing following the reports. In 2022, Russia is hoping its growing partnership with India — a vaccine-producing powerhouse — will help solve the production issues. The RDIF has already promised to produce an impressive 3 billion doses of Sputnik V next year, as well as “several hundred million Sputnik Omicron boosters” to protect the world against the new strain. But for Sputnik V and other Russian vaccines to be accepted globally, EU and World Health Organization (WHO) approval is critical. At the start of the year, the WHO said its review of how Russia produces the Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine had found some issues with the filling of vials at a plant. Both the EU and the WHO have since said Russian manufacturers have yet to provide regulators with missing data for their ongoing review. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov in December said Russia had a “different understanding of what information was needed” for approval. 2022, the year of mass vaccination? Throughout 2021, the Kremlin grappled with the nation’s stubborn refusal to vaccinate, prompting Russian President Vladimir Putin, who received Sputnik V vaccine early in year, to complain in a public meeting in October that he “can’t understand what’s going on.” “We have a reliable and efficient vaccine. The vaccine really reduces the risks of illness, grave complications and death,” he added. Some critics have blamed the country’s leadership for vaccine skepticism, accusing the government of prioritizing its domestic agenda over the battle against the pandemic. At the height of the summer 2020 wave of infection, Moscow suddenly dropped all restrictions to push through a referendum on constitutional changes that allowed Putin to run for further terms as president, declaring that covid had been defeated. And later in the summer, a short-lived QR code program in Moscow and other cities was quickly abandoned after opposition from restaurateurs ahead of important elections to the Duma, Russia’s lower house of parliament. In the background, state-owned media were downplaying the pandemic and ridiculing other nations for their harsh lockdowns. Others say Russia’s low vaccination rate is part of a wider regional phenomenon, as other post-soviet nations including Ukraine and Armenia are also struggling to convince their populations to get the jab. The Kremlin can take some encouragement from a recent Levada poll showing the percentage of Russians willing to be vaccinated against the coronavirus rose from 15% in August to 19% in October, the highest number since the start of the pandemic. Levada also found that 42% of Russians were in favor of universal mandatory vaccination — up from 38% in June. Still, most of the country remains unvaccinated and Russia's vaccination rate has recently started to fall, after hitting a record 400 thousand doses a day during a short lockdown in November. A number of high-placed officials and top doctors have said that without a new and forceful push that would include nationwide mandatory vaccination, the country is unlikely to hit its target of 70% vaccinated. But Putin, whose electoral rating declined during the second half of 2021, has been wary of throwing his full backing behind unpopular Covid measures and has repeatedly said he is not in favor of forced vaccination and widespread QR codes. The Duma has already announced that it will scrap a proposed bill requiring QR codes to access public transport after criticism from Putin. It remains to be seen if Covid passes and other restrictions will be widely introduced across the country in 2022.",1,1050,97.56,34.1,49.82,4.18,27.63,30.76,83.43,58.57,46.1,4.57,1.52,0,0.1,0,0.38,0.57,3.05,16.38,10.67,3.24,16.67,5.05,2.38,5.52,0.29,9.62,6.95,6.29,4.19,0.38,0.57,3.43,8.38,0.19,8.19,2.1,1.43,1.05,0.48,0.29,2.95,0,5.71,1.81,3.9,0.86,0.1,0.67,0,0,0.19,0,6.76,3.9,0.57,0,1.05,0.48,1.33,2.1,0,0,0,0.38,2.1,1.52,0.57,0,2.67,0.1,0,2.38,0.29,0,6.38,5.05,4.19,0,0,0,0,0.1,1.14,0.38,0.1,0.57,0.1,0.67,0,0.29,0.48,0,3.33,8.95,0.38,1.33,6.67,0.67,0.1,0,6.48,4.76,2,0.76,0,0,0,0,0,12.67,3.71,4.57,0.1,0,1.33,2.95

At the behest of President Vladimir Putin, the Russian Supreme Court on Tuesday and Wednesday ordered the dismantling of the country’s two Memorial organizations: Memorial International, which has systematically documented the murderous atrocities perpetrated in the U.S.S.R by Josef Stalin, and Memorial Human Rights Center, which has promoted respect for human rights and the release of political prisoners in post-Soviet Russia. The forced closure of Memorial, after statements by prosecutors that harkened back to the Stalin era, provides ominous confirmation of Russia’s return to authoritarianism under Putin. The campaign against Memorial comes amid a wide-ranging crackdown by Putin on his political opponents and on activists who support democracy and human rights. Through forceful repression and the manipulation of Russia’s legal system, especially laws on “foreign agents” and “extremism,” the Kremlin has wiped out nearly all safeguards against the revival of Soviet-style abuses. The Supreme Court’s verdict against Memorial was preordained once Putin publicly expressed his disdain for the organization’s efforts to bolster public memory and protect human rights. Memorial began as an experimental movement in the late Soviet era when the far-reaching reforms introduced by Mikhail Gorbachev prompted a small group of leading dissidents and intellectuals in the U.S.S.R. to set up an organization that would pursue accountability for the crimes of the Stalin era. The notion of introducing accountability for abuses committed by political leaders was a stunning departure for the U.S.S.R., whose rulers had carried out terrible crimes with impunity. Soviet officials initially wanted to derail Memorial, but eventually they gave in and allowed it to be formally registered in 1989. During the remainder of the Soviet period, Memorial rapidly grew in influence, establishing itself as one of the world’s most highly respected organizations promoting human rights and historical reckoning. After the Soviet Union broke apart, Memorial survived and continued its work, linking Memorial International and the Memorial Human Rights Center.  During the period of relative freedom in the 1990s, Memorial pushed for the declassification of crucial records, published thick volumes of transcribed documents, and compiled databases of information about millions who were killed under Stalin’s rule.  The scale of Stalin’s crimes made it impractical to achieve a full reckoning with the past, but Memorial achieved more than was ever believed possible to ensure that Russians would have access to information about mass atrocities carried out by the Soviet regime. Memorial also sought to ensure that public officials in Russia would no longer be able to engage in violent abuses without accountability.  The organization publicized the cases of political prisoners, opposed curtailments of rights and freedoms, and decried atrocities carried out during Russia’s two wars in Chechnya. But even as Memorial pursued its invaluable work, obstacles gradually emerged.  In the late 1980s and early 1990s, many Soviet citizens were eager to learn about Stalin’s crimes. But in post-Soviet Russia, the trend was less auspicious.  Public interest in the Stalin era diminished and was gradually replaced by a fatalistic apathy. One of the leading reformers under Gorbachev, Aleksandr Yakovlev, who became a staunch supporter of Memorial’s work, commented in early 2001: “When I read all these materials about Stalin’s terror, I am appalled to see that Kremlin leaders were so cruel and destructive toward their own people. But what worries me even more is that the large majority of people in this country {Russia} nowadays are totally indifferent to this information.” The dwindling level of public interest was reinforced by the rise of Putin and the return to an authoritarian mindset in the Kremlin.  Soon after taking office, Putin revived symbols and features of the Stalin era.  In his address to the Federal Assembly in April 2005 he declared that the disintegration of the U.S.S.R. in late 1991 “was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the [20th] century.” Over time, he tried to prevent condemnations of the Stalin-era repressions, and some of his top aides even defended the abuses. In Dec. 2017, Putin’s long-time head of internal security, Aleksandr Bortnikov, argued that Stalin’s repression of millions had been largely justified because “the enemy was trying to defeat us, either in open battle, or relying on traitors within the country, and with their help stirring up trouble, dividing the people, and paralyzing the state’s capacity to react in a timely and effective manner to emerging threats.” Bortnikov insisted that “archival material shows there were objective grounds for a significant percentage of the criminal cases” during Stalin’s Great Terror. Putin has not gone quite as far as Bortnikov in whitewashing Stalin’s record, but his obfuscations about Soviet-era crimes have become more audacious in the years since Russia went to war against Ukraine. In a nationally broadcast speech announcing Russia’s annexation of Crimea in March 2014, Putin used Stalinist terminology, castigating “traitors” and “fifth columnists” in Russia who were supposedly trying to thwart his bid to restore Russian glory. Two months later, Putin signed into law a bill prohibiting criticism of the Soviet Union’s role in World War II. In the years since then, official images of Stalin as a “great leader” who spearheaded the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany have crowded out attempts to commemorate the tens of millions of victims of Stalin’s repressions. Putin has repeatedly made clear in recent interviews that although certain “excesses” occurred during the Stalin era, these should not detract from the “immense pride” that he and other Russians feel in the “national greatness” of the state built by Stalin. The revival of Stalinist phraseology was jarringly evident this week at the court hearings that liquidated Memorial.  The state prosecutor, Aleksei Zafyarov, accused Memorial of having committed “crude violations” of the “foreign agents” law, but most of his comments focused not on the law or the alleged violations but on Memorial’s work in documenting the Stalinist past. His scathing assessment of Memorial’s work and motives was reminiscent of the invective used by Stalin-era prosecutors in the 1930s and 1940s: It is obvious that ‘Memorial,’ having capitalized on the theme of political repressions in the 20th century, has created a deliberately false image of the U.S.S.R. as a terrorist state and has been whitewashing and rehabilitating Nazi war criminals whose hands are stained with the blood of Soviet citizens. Why should we, as descendants of the victors in that war, now feel obliged to watch the rehabilitation of national traitors and Nazi accomplices? Striking a theme championed by Putin in recent years, Zafyarov emphasized that “we, the descendants of the victors have no need to repent or to be embarrassed. We should be proud of our glorious past!” Although Memorial will be appealing the court’s decision, there is little prospect of success on such a high-profile case. But even if Memorial as a legal entity is now defunct, the guiding force behind the organization since 1989 — the desire to understand why so many millions of people were unjustly killed, tortured, and imprisoned in peacetime at the hands of their own rulers —will undoubtedly persist. Putin’s efforts to curtail scrutiny of the Stalin era may succeed in the short term, but the years of research undertaken by Memorial cannot simply be erased from the historical record. Although a renewed drive for historical accountability may be infeasible until Putin is gone from the scene, a new generation of Russians at some point will want to know why so many innocent people died under Stalin’s regime. The work of Memorial will give a crucial boost to any such quest for understanding.",1,1271,96.69,44.25,36.97,3.79,27.04,31.47,81.98,57.91,46.18,4.64,2.36,0.24,0.39,0,0.87,0.31,2.28,14.71,9.36,2.2,17.62,4.96,3.07,6.14,0.47,8.89,6.53,4.09,9.52,0.94,2.52,6.61,9.21,0.39,8.73,1.42,1.81,1.1,1.02,0.31,2.6,0.16,6.85,2.2,4.41,1.49,0.16,1.1,0.31,0.31,0.08,0,8.58,4.56,0.39,0,1.02,1.65,0.47,3.62,0.16,0.08,0,0.87,4.48,3.15,1.26,0.08,2.36,0,0,2.28,0,0.08,2.99,0.24,0.08,0,0,0,0,0,2.44,0.24,0.24,0.08,0,0.16,0,0.47,0.39,0.31,3.3,9.28,0.55,1.81,6.85,0.39,0,0.16,5.35,4.48,2.12,0.71,0.39,0.39,0,0,0,15.5,4.8,4.72,0.08,0.08,2.05,3.78

Will  Respond Decisively  if Russia Invades Ukraine,English,Russia,"U.S. President Joe Biden on Sunday told his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy that Washington ""will respond decisively"" if Russia moves to invade its pro-Western neighbor, the White House said in a statement. With a Russian military buildup on Ukraine's borders, Biden ""made clear"" to Zelenskiy during a phone call that the ""United States and its allies and partners will respond decisively if Russia invades Ukraine,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. The show of U.S. support for Ukraine comes days after Biden warned Russian President Vladimir Putin of severe consequences if Moscow launches a military invasion. In his call with Zelenskiy, Biden also stressed Washington's commitment ""to the principle of 'nothing about you without you,'"" in an apparent reference to the need to include Ukraine in negotiations about its own future. Zelenskiy tweeted afterwards that he appreciated the United States' ""unwavering support"" and that the call ""proves the special nature"" of the two countries' relationship. High-ranking U.S. and Russian officials are due to sit down on Jan. 9 and 10 in Geneva to discuss the crisis. Earlier this week, Biden spoke to Putin, the two leaders' second conversation by phone in three weeks as tensions mount over Ukraine. Discussing the call with Putin on Friday, Biden said: ""I'm not going to negotiate here in public, but we made it clear he cannot — I'll emphasize, cannot — invade Ukraine."" The U.S. leader added, in remarks to reporters during a holiday stay in Delaware, that he had ""made it clear to President Putin that we will have severe sanctions, we will increase our presence in Europe, with NATO allies"" if Russia invades Ukraine. Psaki also said in Sunday's post-call statement that Biden reaffirmed ""the United States' commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity."" The U.S. leader additionally ""expressed support for confidence-building measures to de-escalate tensions in Donbas and active diplomacy to advance the implementation of the Minsk Agreements."" Under the Minsk agreement — brokered by France and Germany — Ukraine agreed to carry out political reforms while Russia agreed to end its support for pro-Russian separatist rebels. Washington and its European allies accuse Russia of threatening Ukraine with a new invasion. Some 100,000 Russian troops are massed near the border of the country, where Putin already seized the Crimea region in 2014 and is accused of fomenting a pro-Russian separatist war which erupted that same year in the east. Moscow describes the troop presence as protection against the expansion of NATO, although Ukraine has not been offered membership in the military alliance. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke Friday with NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg; afterwards, Blinken urged Russia to ""engage meaningfully"" in the upcoming talks on the tense standoff between Moscow and Kiev. Stoltenberg said that NATO was ""united"" and ""prepared for dialogue."" In Thursday's call, Biden warned Putin against invading Ukraine, while the Kremlin leader said anti-Moscow sanctions would be a ""colossal mistake."" After a 50-minute phone call — their second in just over three weeks — both presidents indicated support for further diplomacy. Putin was ""pleased"" overall with the talks, foreign policy adviser Yury Ushakov told reporters. A senior U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the tone ""was serious and substantive.""",1,531,95.1,54.66,40.25,12.37,24.14,31.45,79.47,53.86,40.87,6.21,2.82,0.38,0.75,0.38,0.94,0.19,3.39,12.81,7.72,2.07,15.82,3.77,2.26,5.08,0.94,11.11,4.9,2.64,9.6,3.2,0.38,6.4,6.78,0.19,6.59,0.94,1.32,0.94,0.75,0.38,3.2,0,4.52,1.88,2.64,0.56,0.38,0.19,0.19,0,0,0,16.57,11.3,2.26,0,1.51,0.38,6.97,5.84,0,0,0,0.94,8.66,6.97,1.13,0.56,4.14,0.19,0.56,3.39,0.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.38,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.13,0,2.64,11.49,0.56,0.94,8.85,0.75,0,0.56,4.33,5.46,2.07,1.88,0.19,0.19,0,0,0,21.66,6.78,4.33,0,0,2.45,8.1

The visit comes as the West tries to deter Moscow from launching an attack on its ex-Soviet neighbour, which has battled pro-Kremlin separatists in two eastern regions bordering Russia since 2014. ""We are here first to reaffirm European Union's full support to Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" Borrell told a press conference with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. ""Any military aggression against Ukraine will have messy consequences and severe costs,"" he said in the village of Stanytsya Luganska in the eastern Lugansk region. ""And we are coordinating with the U.S., with NATO and other like-minded partners in order to work for de-escalation."" Borrell's visit, which he said illuminated ""destinies destroyed"" and ""families divided"", was the first by an EU foreign policy chief to eastern Ukraine since war broke out nearly eight years ago. The timing was right, Borrell said, because ""the geopolitical landscape is changing very quickly and the conflict on the borders of Ukraine is on the verge of getting deeper."" The deployment by Russia of tens of thousands of troops to the border has sparked fears in Kiev and among its Western allies of a wider war in Ukraine. Kuleba said he was ""glad"" the EU foreign policy chief had a chance to visit the frontline and ""feel the consequences of the conflict with his own eyes."" Ukraine and the European Union had a common goal, he said, which is ""to de-escalate the situation through diplomatic means so Moscow reduces tensions and abandons its aggressive intentions."" ""The European Union stands shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine in countering Russia's aggressive policy,"" the Ukrainian foreign minister said. The conflict in eastern Ukraine broke out shortly after Russia seized Crimea and has since claimed over 13,000 lives. Kyiv and its Western allies accuse the Kremlin of fomenting the rebellion, a claim Moscow has repeatedly denied. Russian President Vladimir Putin denies planning to attack the neighbouring country, saying the troop movements are to defend Russia against an encroaching Western military. Last month Moscow presented the West with sweeping security demands, saying NATO must not admit new members, including Ukraine, and seeking to bar the United States from establishing new bases in former Soviet republics. High-ranking officials from the United States and Russia are set to hold two days of talks in Geneva on the crisis starting Sunday. But Brussels fears it is being sidelined as Washington and Moscow discuss the balance of power in Europe. ""The limitation of spheres of influence of two big powers"" are no longer relevant, Borrell said Wednesday. ""There is no security in Europe without security of Ukraine. And it is clear that any discussion on European security must involve the EU and Ukraine. U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has sought to assure European allies that it will act in concert with them, dismissing suggestions that it could seek a Cold War-style agreement that affects Europe without its participation.

It's that the Kremlin actually believes Ukraine is planning a military seizure of Crimea and Donbass — where Russian-backed separatists have occupied territories for nearly eight years now — and Moscow is thus weighing options to pre-empt or respond to a potential offensive as it amasses troops on its south-western borders.  There has been a prevalent tendency in Western analysis to pin this Russian troop buildup — which began last spring and then renewed in earnest this fall — on a specific Russian goal of forcing guarantees of NATO non-expansion and then, in the event of a likely denial, using that as a pretext to invade Ukraine. There are limits to what we can know about Russian intentions, especially given that Russian foreign policy, while aggressive, tends to be more reactive than proactive. But one possibility that hasn’t really been factored into the various predictions of how Russia will act this winter is that the escalation is as much about Donbass as it is about NATO. Consider last week’s comments by Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who criticized the West for increasing weapons supplies to and conducting military drills with Ukraine. “The Kiev regime naturally perceives this support as a carte blanche for the use of force,” he said. “An adequate response will be given to any possible provocations by Kiev against Donbass.” Such comments — especially taken with the recent uncharacteristically aggressive warnings of his deputy Sergei Ryabkov — could be dismissed as merely part of a control drama, a deception staged by Moscow to indicate it is serious. But why the additional explanatory rhetoric when its troop amassments alone are quite enough for heavy metal diplomacy, if that is indeed all this was? Looking closely at the statements coming out of Moscow in recent months there has been a consistent strand where it essentially warns the West against backing a Ukrainian offensive. On Nov. 18, a few weeks after reports began emerging about Russian troop buildup, Vladimir Putin made his now famous “red lines,” statement, widely seen as the first harbinger of Moscow’s ultimatum for a new European security architecture on its own terms. But in his speech, he identified “Ukraine’s internal crisis” and its “failure to fulfill [Minsk] obligations” as Russia’s most pressing security issue. The West was “exacerbating” the situation by supplying Kiev with weapons. Putin quite clearly said “tensions should remain” — i.e. Russia would not deescalate — so long as there was risk of “them” — i.e. Ukraine and NATO — “staging some kind of conflict” on Russia’s western border. Then on Nov. 24, Security Council head Nikolai Patrushev alleged that the “West destroyed” Ukraine’s economy; as a result the country could “set ablaze” causing a security crisis for Russia, with an influx of thousands of refugees. It’s not clear how exactly Patrushev imagined Ukraine would “set ablaze,” and while Ukrainian domestic turbulence would affect the war in Donbass, it’s not easy to understand how this domestic turbulence would directly impact Russia’s security. Unless, that is, one imagines a highly unlikely scenario in which Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s government collapses, nationalist hardliners take over, and, with NATO assistance in the form of lethal weapons, attempt to retake Crimea and Donbass by force. Yet Ukraine has denied any such plans, while Zelenskiy has repeatedly affirmed his commitment to peace, all but ruling out any imminent military solution on Ukraine’s part. Why does Moscow, if its comments are genuine, continue to believe it? However unlikely a hardline nationalist offensive against Crimea or the Donbass may be, the Russians' concerns in part reflect Ukrainian politicians' own rhetoric.  Two of Ukraine’s military commanders have openly threatened Russia with force. In June, former special operations commander Serhiy Kryvonos said Ukraine should be ready to strike Russia with a swift “knockout” once it is weakened. To be fair, he did say that until that opportunity arises Ukraine should demonstrate its commitment to a peaceful resolution of the Donbass conflict. The current commander in chief of the armed forces, Valery Zalushny said in September that he'd like to drive a tank through Red Square. Granted, both these comments were made on prime-time public television — and the latter in response to a viewer’s question — but one would question the wisdom of trolling a powerful and paranoid neighbor that has a track record of taking such comments far too seriously. But it’s not just the rhetoric that the Russians seem to be responding to. In their view, a vocal, nationalist minority in Ukraine has consistently stymied all of Zelenskiy’s efforts to follow the Minsk Package of Measures toward a peaceful solution to Donbass. Alas, they are not wrong. In March 2020, Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, Andryi Yermak, met with the Kremlin’s point man on the Donbass issue, Dmitry Kozak, and agreed on a special Advisory Council in which Ukrainian officials would discuss the peace process with representatives of the Russian-backed separatist governments. In return, he was slapped with criminal charges by the SBU. Discussing peace with separatist leaders – something specifically stipulated in the Minsk agreements which Kiev signed – was deemed tantamount to treason. The charges didn’t go anywhere, but the damage was done. Talks ground to a halt. For Zelenskiy, any peaceful solution to Donbass seemed to have become toxic. To survive politically, he had to signal that he was determined to return Crimea — as with the summer 2021 creation of the Crimean Platform, intended to bring back the peninsula that Russia illegally annexed in 2014. The Russians seem to have read this as the final nail in the coffin of the Minsk agreement. Ukraine has no plan to follow through on peacefully reintegrating the statelets in Donbass. The only alternative, the Russians imagine, must be to retake the territories — as well as Crimea — by force. This triggered a change in Moscow’s policy towards Ukraine, and the renewed troop buildup this fall appears part of that change. The new approach was formulated by Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chairman of the security council who penned an uncharacteristically hawkish column arguing that Ukraine wasn’t a real country and therefore it was useless to talk to it. To get anything done, Russia deemed, it should really be seeking guarantees from the United States and NATO, and in Moscow’s view such adversaries only take force seriously. Once again, however unrealistic — and possibly outright delusional, since neither Ukraine nor other NATO members are actually beholden to Washington — this view from Moscow is, it is also backed by history. When a western-leaning politician, Mikheil Saakashvili, came to power in Georgia on the back of a popular coup in 2004, his first move was to try to rein in three pro-Russian separatist breakaway states — Adjara, South Ossetia, and Abkhazia as part of a wider bid of eventually joining NATO. Buoyed by the success of Adjara renouncing its separatist aspirations without a bullet being fired, and inspired by what he thought were promises of U.S. and NATO support, Saakashvili began to prepare to bring Abkhazia and South Ossetia back into the fold, this time militarily. For four years, Russia prepared for and anticipated his strike. This mutual escalation — both political and military — culminated in the Russia-Georgia war of 2008, when Russian troops invaded Georgia, pushed it out of Ossetia and Abkhazia, and officially recognized the two breakaway states as independent. Zelenskiy is no Saakashvili. He seems to have few illusions about NATO membership, and there is no real preparation in Ukraine to pull off what Saakashvili thought he could pull off in 2008. Moreover, both NATO and Washington have made it pretty clear that neither NATO nor U.S. troops would be fighting alongside Ukrainians in the event of a war with Russia. But for the Russians, this message has not been clear enough. It has also been muddled by developments in Ukraine, where there is a consistent mismatch between what Zelenskiy is saying he is committed to on the one hand, and his administration’s actions and the hawkish threats made by some military officials and commentators on the other. There is a stated commitment to the peaceful reintegration of rebel-held territories in Donbass, but in practice any proposed plan by the Zelenskiy administration for actually doing so is stymied. Meanwhile, the focus remains on NATO and U.S. support for Ukraine in the form of lethal weapons and military advisers, and on other measures of deterrence against Russia. These are all mixed messages in Russia’s view, and given that Ukraine doesn’t seem to have a plan on how to follow through on the Minsk agreement or work through the inherent inconsistencies in the document, Moscow seems to have chosen to operate on the assumption that while not necessarily imminent, a Georgian scenario is possible and even likely.  It is responding in kind. In September, I heard from a Kremlin adviser in the nationalist camp that Russia was preparing to officially recognize the statelets. At the time, I brushed aside the remarks as wishful thinking, but since then chatter to this effect has increased – not just among nationalist and patriotic outlets and experts, but in the more diplomatically oriented Russian International Affairs Council. Recognition of the statelets is costly for Russia — it means giving up on the Minsk scenario of reintegrating them back into Ukraine and having to sponsor them forever, bearing the costs of additional Western sanctions. But the current stalemate — where Russia feels it has to support the statelets and be prepared indefinitely to defend them and their borders from what it believes to be an unstable and belligerent Ukraine — is also costly and unsustainable. Now, according to a report last week in the respected Kommersant daily, government officials said that while Russia was not planning any unprovoked invasion, they were weighing recognizing the statelets and officially sending troops there in the event that talks with Washington fail to produce a satisfactory agreement. It is highly unlikely, if next to impossible, that the U.S. will agree wholesale to Russia’s shopping list, as Moscow has demanded. But while the new security architecture Russia is demanding doesn’t directly mention Donbass, it’s increasingly clear that the current escalation is about pushing for some kind of solution to the eight-year conflict — whether through a new security architecture, or, more modestly, through a new Minsk agreement that will be more palatable to Kiev than the current one. In some ways, all that’s left for the United States to do is precisely what the Biden administration has taken to doing. No breakthrough is going to come from the Jan. 10 talks, but they are a necessary platform where U.S. officials can hear Russian concerns and hopefully dispel misconceptions about what the U.S. is prepared to do – and especially what the U.S. is not prepared to do – when it comes to supporting Ukraine. But when it comes to support, that support should be as much, if not more, about helping Ukraine decide on what it actually wants to do about Donbass, and stick to it, for the sake of its own safety and integrity, as it is about deterring Russia.",1,1872,84.15,26.98,41.49,22.91,26.74,31.25,81.36,62.23,50.69,6.78,1.71,0.11,0.05,0,0.96,0.48,5.07,14.21,7.69,1.39,16.29,7.53,4.97,6.78,1.28,13.25,5.88,3.42,6.14,0.91,1.5,4.01,14.96,0.75,14,3.21,2.03,1.34,2.67,1.18,4.11,0,3.95,2.08,1.87,0.64,0.21,0.43,0.05,0.37,0,0,7.48,4.01,0.59,0.05,0.85,0.43,1.76,3.04,0,0,0,1.07,4.65,3.47,1.12,0.05,1.87,0.05,0.05,1.44,0.27,0.05,0.53,0.27,0.05,0,0.11,0,0,0,0.16,0.48,0.21,0.43,0,0.27,0,0.16,1.01,0.11,2.62,8.87,0.32,1.18,6.89,0.59,0.16,0.16,3.74,3.1,4.54,1.92,0.05,0,0.05,0,0,14.26,4.7,5.45,0.11,0,1.87,2.14

What could an agreement look like, and how likely is it? The talks have begun according to a Russian timetable and framed by Russia’s draft treaties with the United States and NATO. These proposals — in reality, sweeping demands — are unacceptable and their rejection may be intended to serve as the pretext for renewed aggression against Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin himself remarked on the “sceptical smiles” of his Foreign Ministry audience when he tasked it to prepare them. It is unthinkable that, as Russia threatens a massive use of force in Europe, NATO would de facto reverse its post-1997 enlargement, or America withdraw its nuclear weapons from the continent. Russia’s demands are, in any case, misdirection. Its immediate concern is not the 25-year history of NATO enlargement, but its own currently declining influence over Ukraine — whose Western ties are growing deeper, resistance to local pro-Russian figures like Viktor Medvedchuk sterner, and national identity stronger. Since time is not on Putin’s side, he is seeking to assert dominance over Kyiv while this is still possible, a goal hardened by his view that Ukraine is an essential part of Russia. Russia’s real driver, then, is more status and identity than security. These are harder goals for diplomacy to address. Security can be cooperative and mutual, as the U.S.-Russian agreement to extend the New START nuclear treaty last February showed. But great power revisionism is incompatible with the principle of sovereign equality that underpins international order, and threatens the security of other states. Nonetheless, the West has decided to engage with Russia rather than reject its demands outright. What can it discuss?  Russia’s ostensible and chronic grievance — NATO enlargement — and its real and urgent concern — Ukraine — overlap on the issue of Ukraine’s potential membership of NATO. Some seasoned Western diplomats with no illusions about Russia have long expressed concern over NATO’s 2008 Bucharest summit, which declared that Georgia and Ukraine “will become members of NATO.” Russia’s occupation of Ukrainian territory in practice makes it very unlikely that NATO would extend a collective security commitment to Ukraine. Russia’s own aggression has provided the assurance that it now demands of NATO. Does this mean, as some argue, that NATO should now assure Russia that Ukraine will never join? Critics condemn this as betraying a victim of aggression. But the argument should be addressed, not condemned. Western governments are accountable to their populations and guided by national interest. Last year they concluded that these interests were no longer compatible with long-standing commitments to Afghanistan, and swiftly abandoned the country to its fate, an outcome that probably emboldened the Kremlin’s coercion of Ukraine. Is it in the West’s interest to accommodate Russia’s designs on Ukraine? No, this realist case is flawed. Russia’s behaviour offers no assurance that a favorable deal would satisfy it. Not only do Russia’s demands on Ukraine extend far beyond the question of NATO membership, but it has never signalled that its interests are limited to Ukraine, or even to the territory of the former Soviet Union as a whole. On the contrary, through military, cyber, informational and energy instruments, Russia is pursuing a more assertive policy towards Europe — and not only NATO members — than during much of the Cold War. Its sweeping demands for NATO’s retreat only underscore the extent of its ambitions. A settlement over Ukraine would not be a solution, but a prelude. It would make the West less, not more, secure. Nor is constraining Ukraine’s freedom of choice likely to produce even local stability. In 2014 Russian pressure to stop former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych from signing an association agreement with the European Union triggered the mass demonstrations that forced him from power. With 72% of Ukrainians now viewing Russia as a threat, its diktat will not be accepted quietly. In short, the case against Realist accommodation is not only ethical but practical: In the 21st century, spheres of influence neither satisfy large aggressors nor can easily be imposed on small victims. But the West can usefully discuss some specific Russian concerns — not least as some would involve restrictions on actions the West has no intention of undertaking, such as deploying missiles in Ukraine that can hit Russia. But there should be no unilateral concessions — any offer requires a quid pro quo. Creative exploration of this nexus offers the best prospect of an agreement, even though Russia’s violation of past commitments, and the illegitimacy of its current position as an occupier of Ukraine, make this more difficult. But even in the best case, the win-set is small. Diplomatic success requires Russia to scale back its demands very substantially. It will only do so if it is persuaded that renewed aggression will bring more costs than benefits. The West can improve the slim chance of agreement by managing the diplomatic process in two ways. First, it must maintain the agreed negotiating format. Despite Russia’s clear preference for dealing only with the U.S. and major European powers, America has secured a three-track process that includes NATO and the OSCE as well as bilateral talks. It should make clear that all three tracks are equally important. This ensures the participation of all European states, including Ukraine and virtually guarantees there will be no rapid outcome. An inclusive process demonstrates Western cohesion and slows down the crisis. Second, the West must visibly plan for the worst case to show Russia it faces a severe and united response to renewed aggression. This will include severe economic and financial sanctions, and may cause Finland and Sweden to move closer to NATO membership. This would continue a trend of Russian actions producing the opposite effects to those intended, in this case, a stronger, larger NATO. In short, the West — not only the U.S. but Europe too — should conceive and conduct its diplomacy as part of, and not an alternative to, deterrence. This offers the main hope of averting Russian renewed aggression and the biggest clash of conventional forces in Europe since 1945.",1,1015,78.6,17.13,17.66,12.07,19.15,33,80.79,59.21,47.59,7.49,1.08,0,0,0,0.59,0.39,6.4,15.57,7.49,1.28,13.5,7.09,3.55,6.6,2.36,9.56,10.15,3.74,6.9,1.28,1.28,4.43,13.5,1.08,12.41,1.28,2.27,2.27,1.48,0.69,4.63,0,5.12,2.17,2.96,1.08,0.2,0.89,0,0.89,0,0,8.28,5.71,0.39,0.3,1.58,0.49,1.28,2.36,0,0,0,0.59,4.93,3.35,1.28,0.3,1.97,0,0.2,1.28,0.3,0.2,0.3,0.1,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.79,0.1,0.1,0,0.2,0,0.39,1.18,0.49,3.45,7.59,0.49,0.69,5.71,0.59,0.1,0.1,3.55,1.28,4.53,1.58,0,0,0,0,0,14.19,5.42,5.22,0.39,0,1.87,1.28

Meeting senior Kremlin envoys at their headquarters in Brussels, the NATO members said Moscow would have no veto on Ukraine or any other country joining the alliance, warning it would pay a high price if it invaded. ""Russia most of all will have to decide whether they really are about security, in which case they should engage, or whether this was all a pretext, and they may not even know yet,"" U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said. Putin's government has demanded the West to rule out accepting new members like Ukraine, Georgia or Finland on its eastern flank and has demanded limits on allied deployments in the former Soviet allies that joined NATO after the Cold War. Russia's massive troop build-up on Ukraine's borders has forced Washington to engage diplomatically — with bilateral security talks in Geneva on Monday, a NATO-Russia meeting on Wednesday and another planned at the OSCE in Vienna on Thursday. But the Western allies have received no promise that Russia will stand down its forces — which Moscow insists pose no threat to its already partially occupied neighbor — despite threatening massive economic sanctions if the Kremlin unleashes an invasion. Instead, the 30 member states invited the Russian envoys to return to Moscow and to advise Putin to join them for a series of confidence-building talks on limiting provocative military exercises, arms control and reciprocal limits on deploying missiles. ""Russia was not in a position to agree on that proposal. They didn't reject it either, but the Russian representatives made it clear that they needed some time to come back to NATO with an answer,"" alliance Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned: ""There are significant differences between NATO allies and Russia on these issues,"" he warned. Stoltenberg said it would be impossible for NATO members to agree to Moscow's core demands for a new security order in Europe, and in particular added that Russia would have no veto on Ukraine's right to eventually join the alliance. ""Ukraine as a sovereign nation... has the right to self-defense. Ukraine is not a threat to Russia,"" he said. ""It is Russia that is the aggressor. It is Russia that has used force and continues to use force against Ukraine. ""And then they're building up, with around 100,000 troops, artillery, armour, drones, tens of thousands of combat-ready troops and threatening rhetoric — that's the problem."" The West defends NATO's ""open-door policy"" towards potential future members, while Moscow is demanding a cast-iron guarantee that the alliance will not expand further towards its territory, seeing the westward tilt of one-time Warsaw Pact or Soviet allies as a threat. Before Wednesday, the NATO-Russia council had not met since 2019. NATO and Russia broke off practical cooperation in 2014 after Moscow occupied and annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea. Russia's diplomatic mission to the alliance was withdrawn in October last year after eight of its staff were expelled on allegations of espionage. But the former ambassador — now a deputy foreign minister — Alexander Grushko was back to confront Stoltenberg and Sherman, having earlier this week described the meeting as a ""moment of truth."" After the meeting, the senior U.S. diplomat said: ""Together, the United States and our NATO allies made clear we will not slam the door shut on NATO's open-door policy. ""NATO has never expanded through force or coercion or subversion. It is countries' sovereign choice to choose to come to NATO and say they want to join."" Just ahead of the talks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""The continuation of NATO's open-door policy and the further advancement of NATO towards our borders is precisely what, from our point of view, threatens us. ""This is exactly what we are asking not to continue through legally-binding guarantees."" The allies have threatened massive economic and financial sanctions against Moscow if its huge troop build-up on Ukraine's frontiers and in Russian-occupied Crimea turns into a new invasion. Peskov refused to be drawn on whether Russia could launch a military operation if denied. ""We would not like to throw around threats and ultimatums like American officials,"" he added. Russia has put intense pressure on Ukraine since 2014, after a revolution overthrew a government that had sided with the Kremlin against moving closer to Europe. Russia has seized and annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea and Moscow backs an insurgency in eastern Ukraine in which more than 13,000 people have died.",1,763,88.21,41.61,53.56,7.34,24.61,28.57,81.91,57.4,46,6.95,2.49,0,0.92,0,0.39,1.18,4.46,12.19,7.08,1.05,16.12,6.55,1.83,6.95,1.83,12.45,5.24,2.75,11.4,4.98,0.26,6.16,11.66,0.92,10.62,0.79,1.57,1.31,1.83,0.79,5.5,0,4.85,1.7,3.15,0.13,0,0.13,0,0.13,0,0,13.76,8.52,2.36,0.26,2.1,0,3.15,6.68,0,0,0,0.52,6.16,5.11,1.05,0,2.36,0,0.13,1.57,0.66,0,0.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.13,0.39,0.13,0.26,0,0,0,0,2.1,0.13,4.19,9.83,0.39,1.44,7.99,0.26,0,0.13,4.59,4.46,3.67,1.7,0.26,0,0.26,0,0,16.51,4.85,4.46,0,0,1.97,5.24

S ., Russia Hold High - Stakes Talks on Ukraine",English,Russia,"Top U.S. and Russian officials held crucial talks Monday with tensions soaring over Ukraine and security demands from Moscow, but there was little hope of a diplomatic breakthrough. The high-stakes negotiations come amid fears of a Russian invasion of its pro-Western neighbor Ukraine, and with Moscow demanding wide-ranging concessions from Washington and its NATO allies. Monday's talks in Geneva launch a week of diplomacy between Russia and the West after Moscow amassed tens of thousands of troops at the Ukrainian border, drawing the United States into a Cold War-style stand-off. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov opened their meeting at the U.S. mission in Geneva at 8:55 a.m. (07:55 GMT). A convoy of black vehicles with Russian diplomatic plates had arrived shortly before, and was ushered through the large iron gates under a billowing U.S. flag. The two diplomats had already met informally in the Swiss city on Sunday evening, with Ryabkov afterwards telling Russian news agencies the first meeting had been ""difficult."" State news agency RIA Novosti on Monday quoted Ryabkov saying he feared Washington was not taking seriously Moscow's demand of an end to NATO's eastward expansion. Pointing to a 2008 promise by NATO to consider membership for Ukraine and others, Ryabkov said: ""Are they ready to give legal guarantees that this country, as well as other countries... will not join NATO?"" ""I have a rather pessimistic forecast in this regard."" Sherman said on Twitter that the talks were underway but there would be little progress without others at the table. ""The U.S. will listen to Russia's concerns and share our own, but we have been clear we will not discuss European security without our allies and partners,"" she said. Sherman in the talks on Sunday had stressed ""the freedom of sovereign nations to choose their own alliances,"" the State Department said. In the muddy trenches on the frontline in Ukraine, where Kyiv's forces have been battling pro-Russian fighters since 2014, there was little hope for diplomacy. ""I doubt that anything will change,"" 29-year-old soldier Mykhailo said as he walked through trenches in the town of Avdiivka, just north of the separatist stronghold city of Donetsk. ""Guarantees of not joining NATO will never stop"" Russian President Vladimir Putin, Mykhailo said, adding: ""He wants to return the Soviet Union in version 2.0."" Both sides have set firm lines, with Washington warning that Moscow would face severe diplomatic and economic consequences from an invasion of Ukraine, and Russia demanding wide-ranging new security arrangements with the West. After Monday's talks, a meeting of the NATO-Russia Council will take place in Brussels on Wednesday, then the permanent council of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) will meet in Vienna on Thursday with the issue of Ukraine expected to dominate. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken stressed Sunday that Russia had to choose between dialogue and confrontation, warning on CNN that there would be ""massive consequences for Russia if it renews its aggression on Ukraine."" Blinken warned that any positive outcome from the talks would rely in part on Russia's willingness to stand down from its aggressive posture, which he likened to ""an atmosphere of escalation with a gun to Ukraine's head."" Any direct military action by the United States or NATO in defense of Ukraine is extremely unlikely. But Western officials have warned Moscow would face significant economic and financial consequences if it invades, and could see NATO boost its presence and capacities near Russia's borders. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Monday that the alliance would be warning Russia of the ""severe costs"" of an invasion. He said he did not expect this week's talks to ""solve all the issues,"" but wanted to kickstart a diplomatic process. ""We are aiming for an agreement on a way forward, a process, a series of meetings,"" Stoltenberg said before talks with Ukraine's deputy prime minister in Brussels. Measures against Russia under consideration include sanctions on Putin's inner circle, canceling Russia's controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany or, in the most drastic scenario, severing Russia's links to the world's banking system. Moscow insists it was deceived after the Cold War and understood that NATO would not expand eastward. Instead, the U.S.-led alliance welcomed most of the former Warsaw Pact countries and the three Baltic nations that were under Soviet rule.

After more than seven hours of negotiations in Geneva, the Russian and U.S. negotiators both offered to keep talking, though there was no sign of a major breakthrough. The high-stakes negotiations came amid fears of a Russian invasion of its pro-Western neighbor Ukraine, and with Moscow demanding wide-ranging concessions from Washington and its NATO allies. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said he had assured his U.S. counterpart, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, that those fears were unfounded. ""We explained to our colleagues that we have no plans, no intentions to 'attack' Ukraine... There is no reason to fear any escalation in this regard,"" he told reporters after the talks. Ryabkov said the United States ""took Russian proposals very seriously"" and that Moscow was ""for the continuation of dialogue."" Sherman said that she offered to make reciprocal moves with Russia on missiles and exercises, but renewed warnings of major costs if Moscow invaded Ukraine. She said the United States was ready to meet again, but that Russia had not offered assurances that it will pull back troops amassed near Ukraine. And she insisted that some of Russia's demands were ""simply non-starters,"" including a ban on NATO's further eastward expansion. ""We will not allow anyone to slam closed NATO's open-door policy,"" Sherman said.

Sherman renewed a call on Russia to pull back its estimated 100,000 troops. If Russia invades, she said, ""there will be significant costs and consequences, well beyond what they faced in 2014,"" when Moscow seized the Crimean peninsula and backed an insurgency in eastern Ukraine. Ryabkov denounced U.S. threats as ""attempts at blackmail and intimidation,"" but said ""I don't think the situation is hopeless.""

The European Union's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the bloc was mobilizing ""all its resources"" to aid its ally after the attacks temporarily brought down sites, including those of the foreign ministry and cabinet. Kyiv said the damage was limited and held back on apportioning blame but the ex-Soviet country has accused Russians with links to Moscow for previous hits on websites and key infrastructure. ""As a result of a massive cyberattack, the websites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a number of other government agencies are temporarily down,"" a foreign ministry spokesman told AFP. The foreign ministry website earlier Friday displayed a message in Ukrainian, Russian and Polish warning Ukrainians that their personal data had been compromised. ""All information about you has become public, be afraid and expect the worst,"" the message read. The education ministry also said its website had been targeted in a ""global"" hack overnight while the emergencies ministry site was brought down as well. Within hours of the initial announcement, the SBU security services said access to most sites had been restored and that the fallout was minimal according to initial estimates. ""The content of sites has not been changed and according to preliminary information no personal data was leaked,"" the SBU security service said in a statement. The SBU said access to many of the affected sites had been restored with the remainder to return online ""soon."" Kyiv has not yet blamed any individual or entities and Borrell said it was too early ""to point the finger at anybody. We don't have proof."" But he added: ""You can imagine who did this."" In October 2020, the United States charged six Russians with carrying out cyber attacks on Ukraine's power grid, the 2017 French elections and the 2018 Winter Olympics. The Justice Department at the time said the six were current or former members of the GRU Russian military intelligence and were also accused of staging a malware attack called ""NotPetya"" that infected computers of businesses worldwide causing nearly $1 billion in losses. The latest attack came at a time of soaring tensions between Russia and the West over Ukraine, a close ally of the United States and Europe. The West has accused Russia of deploying tanks, artillery and about 100,000 soldiers on Ukraine's war-torn eastern border in recent weeks, in what NATO says is preparation for an invasion. Moscow says it has no plans to invade Ukraine. Footage published by the Russian Defense Ministry Friday showed Russian tanks and infantry carrying out firing drills near the city of Rostov-on-Don in southern Russia near Ukraine. Moscow says this is a response to what it sees as the growing presence of NATO in its sphere of influence, where it fiercely opposes the expansion of the Atlantic alliance. Russia also says the U.S.-led military alliance should not admit Ukraine or Georgia as new members. This week the United States and its NATO allies held talks with Russia in an attempt to ease tensions, but all three rounds of negotiations — in Geneva, Brussels and Vienna — proved unsuccessful. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Thursday that Moscow saw no reason to hold a new round of security talks with the West following a lack of progress. Ryabkov also said he did not rule out the possibility that Moscow could deploy forces to allies Venezuela or Cuba if diplomacy failed.",1,587,94.12,42.07,50.79,2.72,24.46,29.64,82.96,58.26,44.46,4.77,1.19,0,0.17,0.34,0.34,0.17,3.58,14.99,10.05,1.53,14.31,5.79,2.21,6.13,1.36,11.93,6.64,3.24,6.47,1.53,0.68,4.26,8.18,1.02,7.16,1.53,1.53,0.85,1.87,0.17,2.39,0,4.26,0.85,3.41,0.34,0,0.34,0.17,0.17,0,0,11.07,8.18,1.36,0,1.53,1.02,4.09,3.58,0,0.34,0,0.51,7.67,4.43,1.53,1.7,2.39,0.17,0.17,2.04,0.17,0,0.34,0.17,0.17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.17,0,0,0.51,0,0,0,0.85,0,2.39,11.58,0.17,1.36,9.03,0.68,0,0.51,5.11,8.01,3.41,0.68,0,0,0,0,0,12.44,4.43,2.9,0,0,0.68,4.43

S ., Russia Hold High - Stakes Talks on Ukraine War Fears",English,Russia,"Russia ruled out Sunday any concession at talks with the United States on soaring tensions over Ukraine, as Moscow, facing strong pressure to pull back troops, seeks a wide-ranging new security arrangement with the West. Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told Russian news agencies ahead of his talks in Geneva the Kremlin was ""disappointed"" with signals coming from Washington and from Brussels, where NATO and the European Union are based. The high-level discussions kick off a week of diplomacy in which Russia will meet with NATO and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), as the United States tries to assure European allies they will not be sidelined. Since late last year, Russia has amassed tens of thousands of troops at the Ukrainian border and demanded guarantees that NATO will not expand further eastward. The Kremlin is insisting NATO must never grant membership to ex-Soviet Ukraine, which is pushing to join. The United States, to be represented by Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, agreed to talks even though it made plain that many of Moscow's proposals are non-starters. Originally scheduled to start on Monday, Sherman is now due to have a working dinner with Ryabkov on Sunday evening, said a State Department spokesperson. Russia's Foreign Ministry posted footage of Ryabkov's plane arriving in Geneva. ""We will not agree to any concession. That is completely excluded,"" Ryabkov said before departing. ""We are disappointed with the signals coming in the last few days from Washington but also from Brussels."" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, dismissing Moscow's demands as ""gaslighting"", has insisted that talks will yield no progress so long as Russia has a ""gun to Ukraine's head."" ""We're prepared to respond forcefully to further Russian aggression. But a diplomatic solution is still possible and preferable if Russia chooses it,"" Blinken said Friday. Russian President Vladimir Putin met his US counterpart Joe Biden in Geneva in June and agreed on regular ""stability"" talks between Sherman and Ryabkov. In two phone calls to Putin, Biden has warned of severe consequences if Russia invades Ukraine. Measures under consideration include sanctions on Putin's inner circle, cancelling Russia's controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany or, in the most drastic scenario, severing Russia's links to the world's banking system. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, warned that Washington would also send more troops to eastern NATO members such as Poland and the Baltic states if Russia invaded Ukraine. Europeans have showed solidarity, with EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell visiting the frontline in Ukraine, although some nations are expected to hesitate at the strongest measures. ""Whatever the solution, Europe has to be involved,"" EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said. Russia insists it was deceived after the Cold War and understood that NATO would not expand. Instead, the U.S.-led alliance welcomed most of the former Warsaw Pact countries and the three Baltic nations that were under Soviet rule. Russia has put intense pressure on Ukraine since 2014 after a revolution overthrew a government that had sided with the Kremlin against moving closer to Europe. Russia seized the Crimean peninsula and backs an insurgency in eastern Ukraine in which more than 13,000 people have died. At a time when Russia is also intervening to shore up allies facing popular uprisings in Belarus and Kazakhstan, Moscow has insisted it wants concrete progress in talks with Washington. Putin's foreign policy adviser Yury Ushakov warned after the call with Biden that the United States would make a ""colossal mistake"" if it went ahead with sanctions. ""It is very likely that we will encounter the reticence of our U.S. and NATO colleagues to really perceive what we need,"" Ryabkov said Sunday. In spite ""of the threats that are constantly formulated against us ... we wil make no concession,"" he said, adding it would ""amount to acting against the interests of our seccurity."" NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg, meeting foreign ministers of the alliance on Friday, said there remained real risks of a Russian invasion. But John Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, described the Russian troop build-up as a ""gigantic bluff"" by Putin to seek a negotiated agreement. ""They are trying to see if the Biden administration or Europe will blink,"" said Herbst, now at the Atlantic Council think tank. ""As long as the Biden administration remains at least as strong as it is now,"" he said, ""it probably is enough to keep Putin from striking large into Ukraine, but I don't rule out something smaller."" Matthew Rojansky, director of the Kennan Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, said the Geneva talks were more about preventing the Ukraine crisis from accelerating than reaching a major deal.",1,787,91.77,46.83,34.22,13.43,23.15,29.22,77.76,57.18,43.33,5.46,2.16,0.13,1.27,0,0.51,0.25,3.3,11.18,6.99,0.76,16.39,5.97,2.8,6.35,1.02,13.85,5.72,2.92,7.62,3.05,0.89,3.68,10.17,0.38,9.66,1.02,1.4,1.27,1.78,1.02,3.68,0,3.18,1.27,1.91,0.51,0,0.51,0,0.25,0.25,0,11.31,6.99,0.64,0.25,0.51,0.13,4.45,4.7,0,0,0,0.51,7.37,5.97,1.27,0.13,3.05,0,0,3.05,0.13,0,0.38,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.13,0.13,0.38,0.13,0.13,0,0.13,0,0,1.4,0.13,3.43,9.15,0.76,1.65,6.48,0.25,0,0.25,4.7,3.94,4.45,2.16,0.13,0,0.13,0,0,17.92,5.84,5.34,0,0,1.65,5.08

Says  Too Early To Tell  if Russia Serious on Security Talks,English,Russia,"The White House said Tuesday it is ""too early"" to know whether Russia is serious about resolving security tensions in and around Ukraine. After talks with U.S. diplomats in Geneva and with more negotiations to come in Brussels, ""it's too early to tell whether the Russians are serious about the path to diplomacy or not,"" Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters. Psaki said it remained to be seen ""if they're prepared to negotiate seriously — we are — or whether they'll use discussions as a pretext that diplomacy couldn't possibly work."" The next round of talks will be between NATO and Russia on Wednesday, with a third session between the OSCE regional security body and Russia planned for Thursday. Washington and its European allies are pressuring Russia to pull a large force back from the border with Ukraine, while Moscow is pushing the West to agree to a long list of what the Kremlin says are security guarantees. Psaki reiterated the U.S. rejection of Russia's demand that Ukraine not be offered NATO membership one day, saying this is ""a matter only for Ukraine and the 30 NATO allies, not for other countries to determine."" ""There are a range of discussions that can be part of a diplomatic path but ultimately it's up to the Russians to determine about whether they're going to take a serious approach to it or not,"" she said.",1,230,80.5,18.24,71.83,15.38,32.86,25.65,88.7,68.7,53.04,6.96,2.17,0,0.43,0,0.43,1.3,4.78,12.17,8.26,1.3,17.39,9.13,4.78,7.83,2.17,17.83,7.83,3.04,4.78,1.74,0.87,2.17,13.04,0,13.04,2.17,0.87,0.87,2.17,0.87,6.52,0,1.3,0.43,0.87,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.3,8.26,1.3,0.43,0.43,0,5.65,3.91,0,0,0.43,0,4.78,3.48,1.3,0,4.35,0,0.43,3.91,0,0,0.43,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.43,0,0,0,0,1.3,0,3.04,10.43,0,1.74,7.83,0.87,0,0.43,4.35,3.04,7.39,3.04,0.43,0,0.43,0,0,15.22,4.78,3.04,0,0,3.04,4.35

Meeting senior Kremlin envoys at their headquarters in Brussels, the NATO members said Moscow would have no veto on Ukraine or any other country joining the alliance, warning it would pay a high price if it invaded. ""Russia most of all will have to decide whether they really are about security, in which case they should engage, or whether this was all a pretext, and they may not even know yet,"" U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said. Putin's government has demanded the West to rule out accepting new members like Ukraine, Georgia or Finland on its eastern flank and has demanded limits on allied deployments in the former Soviet allies that joined NATO after the Cold War. Russia's massive troop build-up on Ukraine's borders has forced Washington to engage diplomatically — with bilateral security talks in Geneva on Monday, a NATO-Russia meeting on Wednesday and another planned at the OSCE in Vienna on Thursday. But the Western allies have received no promise that Russia will stand down its forces — which Moscow insists pose no threat to its already partially occupied neighbor — despite threatening massive economic sanctions if the Kremlin unleashes an invasion. Instead, the 30 member states invited the Russian envoys to return to Moscow and to advise Putin to join them for a series of confidence-building talks on limiting provocative military exercises, arms control and reciprocal limits on deploying missiles. ""Russia was not in a position to agree on that proposal. They didn't reject it either, but the Russian representatives made it clear that they needed some time to come back to NATO with an answer,"" alliance Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned: ""There are significant differences between NATO allies and Russia on these issues,"" he warned. Stoltenberg said it would be impossible for NATO members to agree to Moscow's core demands for a new security order in Europe, and in particular added that Russia would have no veto on Ukraine's right to eventually join the alliance. ""Ukraine as a sovereign nation... has the right to self-defense. Ukraine is not a threat to Russia,"" he said. ""It is Russia that is the aggressor. It is Russia that has used force and continues to use force against Ukraine. ""And then they're building up, with around 100,000 troops, artillery, armour, drones, tens of thousands of combat-ready troops and threatening rhetoric — that's the problem."" The West defends NATO's ""open-door policy"" towards potential future members, while Moscow is demanding a cast-iron guarantee that the alliance will not expand further towards its territory, seeing the westward tilt of one-time Warsaw Pact or Soviet allies as a threat. Before Wednesday, the NATO-Russia council had not met since 2019. NATO and Russia broke off practical cooperation in 2014 after Moscow occupied and annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea. Russia's diplomatic mission to the alliance was withdrawn in October last year after eight of its staff were expelled on allegations of espionage. But the former ambassador — now a deputy foreign minister — Alexander Grushko was back to confront Stoltenberg and Sherman, having earlier this week described the meeting as a ""moment of truth."" After the meeting, the senior U.S. diplomat said: ""Together, the United States and our NATO allies made clear we will not slam the door shut on NATO's open-door policy. ""NATO has never expanded through force or coercion or subversion. It is countries' sovereign choice to choose to come to NATO and say they want to join."" Just ahead of the talks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""The continuation of NATO's open-door policy and the further advancement of NATO towards our borders is precisely what, from our point of view, threatens us. ""This is exactly what we are asking not to continue through legally-binding guarantees."" The allies have threatened massive economic and financial sanctions against Moscow if its huge troop build-up on Ukraine's frontiers and in Russian-occupied Crimea turns into a new invasion. Peskov refused to be drawn on whether Russia could launch a military operation if denied. ""We would not like to throw around threats and ultimatums like American officials,"" he added. Russia has put intense pressure on Ukraine since 2014, after a revolution overthrew a government that had sided with the Kremlin against moving closer to Europe. Russia has seized and annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea and Moscow backs an insurgency in eastern Ukraine in which more than 13,000 people have died.",1,763,88.21,41.61,53.56,7.34,24.61,28.57,81.91,57.4,46,6.95,2.49,0,0.92,0,0.39,1.18,4.46,12.19,7.08,1.05,16.12,6.55,1.83,6.95,1.83,12.45,5.24,2.75,11.4,4.98,0.26,6.16,11.66,0.92,10.62,0.79,1.57,1.31,1.83,0.79,5.5,0,4.85,1.7,3.15,0.13,0,0.13,0,0.13,0,0,13.76,8.52,2.36,0.26,2.1,0,3.15,6.68,0,0,0,0.52,6.16,5.11,1.05,0,2.36,0,0.13,1.57,0.66,0,0.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.13,0.39,0.13,0.26,0,0,0,0,2.1,0.13,4.19,9.83,0.39,1.44,7.99,0.26,0,0.13,4.59,4.46,3.67,1.7,0.26,0,0.26,0,0,16.51,4.85,4.46,0,0,1.97,5.24

Senators Ready Sanctions if Russia Invades Ukraine,English,Russia,"U.S. senators from President Joe Biden's Democratic Party on Wednesday threatened major consequences if Russia invades Ukraine, including sanctions on President Vladimir Putin, Russian banks, and $500 million in fresh security aid to Kyiv. The introduction of legislation comes as the United States and its NATO allies hold talks with Russia and warn of high costs if the tens of thousands of troops on Ukraine's border advance. ""We are coming together to send a clear message — Putin need not collapse his entire economy nor does he need to sacrifice the lives of his own people in a futile attempt to rewrite the map of Europe,"" said Senator Bob Menendez, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said the legislation ""serves as a powerful deterrent by immediately and forcefully imposing crippling sanctions"" if Russia invades. The so-called Defending Ukraine Sovereignty Act would mandate U.S. sanctions on Putin and an array of top Russian officials as well as on at least three major financial institutions. It would also penalize services such as the SWIFT international banking network if they deal with sanctioned Russians. The act would provide $500 million in additional military aid to Ukraine to face off a Russian invasion, more than doubling what the Biden administration has provided in the past year. U.S. lawmakers across party lines take a hard line against Putin, who has denied plans to invade Ukraine but made security demands including guarantees that NATO will not expand into its neighbor, where a pro-Moscow insurgency has raged since 2014. But the Democratic-led legislation comes amid a feud in Congress as Republicans led by Senator Ted Cruz call a vote on a bill that would slap sanctions on businesses involved in Nord Stream 2, a gas pipeline built from Russia to Germany that has long been opposed by Ukraine which fears losing leverage. Democrats agreed to the vote in a deal in which Cruz lifted a months-long holdup of Biden's ambassadorial nominees, but the Biden administration has been pressing hard against his bill, saying it would put at risk an understanding with Germany to stop the pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine. Cruz's bill ""will undermine our efforts to deter Russia and remove leverage the United States and our allies and partners possess in this moment all to score political points at home,"" National Security Council spokeswoman Emily Horne said. She said the administration backed Menendez's bill as it would ""trigger severe costs to Russia’s economy,"" she said.",1,415,95.63,47.2,14.49,8.85,34.58,29.16,80.96,52.77,41.2,5.54,2.65,0,0.72,0,1.45,0.24,2.89,12.77,7.95,2.17,15.9,4.1,0.96,6.51,0.72,9.4,5.3,3.86,13.01,2.65,0.96,9.16,8.67,0.24,8.19,0.48,1.45,1.93,1.2,0.24,3.86,0,3.37,0.96,2.17,0.72,0,0.48,0.24,0.24,0,0,12.05,7.47,1.2,0,2.65,0,2.65,5.06,0,0,0.72,0.96,10.36,9.4,0.96,0,6.02,0.48,0.48,3.86,1.93,0,0.24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.48,0,0.24,0,0,0,0,1.93,0,2.65,9.16,0.24,1.2,8.19,0,0,0.48,1.93,3.37,2.89,0.72,0,0,0,0,0,12.29,4.34,3.13,0,0,1.45,3.37

Says No Progress With Russia as Long as  Gun to Ukraine Head  ",English,Russia,"U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned on Wednesday that Russia must ease pressure on Ukraine if it wants progress, as he renewed a warning of ""massive consequences"" for an invasion. Russia and the United States hold talks next week in Geneva after Moscow amassed tens of thousands of troops on the Ukrainian border and asked the West for guarantees against expanding the NATO alliance. If the talks are ""going to show real progress, that will require de-escalation,"" Blinken told a joint news conference with German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock. Pointing to Russia's hopes for progress in areas such as arms control, Blinken said, ""It's very hard to make actual progress in any of these areas in an atmosphere of escalation and threat with a gun pointed to Ukraine's head."" ""Russia should be in no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine would have massive consequences and severe costs in response,"" Blinken said. Baerbock, paying her first visit to Washington since taking office, agreed on the need for ""severe consequences"" if Russia attacks Ukraine. The United States and Germany have been at loggerheads for years over Nord Stream 2, which is set to open and ship Russian gas directly to Europe's largest economy. ""From our perspective, it's very hard to see gas flowing through that pipeline, to become operational, if Russia renews its aggression,"" Blinken said. Drawing criticism at home, President Joe Biden's administration has declined to impose sanctions over Nord Stream, saying it was virtually complete. But the administration last year reached an agreement in which Germany promised aid to Ukraine and warned Russia against using the pipeline for geopolitical advantage. Baerbock, asked if Germany was ready to cancel the pipeline, said only that the new government backed last year's agreement with the United States. The new government ""agreed that we take effective measures together with our European partners should Russia use energy as a weapon,"" she said.",1,319,94.37,43.76,11.84,3.82,26.58,29.47,78.37,55.8,40.44,6.27,1.88,0,0.94,0,0.94,0,4.39,11.29,6.27,0.94,16.61,5.02,1.25,5.64,0.31,13.79,5.96,2.82,7.21,2.19,1.88,3.45,11.29,0,11.29,0.31,2.82,2.19,2.19,1.88,3.45,0,4.7,1.25,3.45,0.94,0.31,0.63,0,0.63,0,0,11.6,8.15,0.94,0,1.57,0,5.02,3.45,0,0,0.63,0.31,6.9,5.64,1.25,0,3.76,0,0.31,2.51,0.94,0,0.63,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.94,0.63,0.94,0,0.31,0,0.31,2.19,0,3.45,8.15,0.94,0.63,5.64,0.63,0,0.63,4.7,4.7,2.82,2.19,0,0,0,0,0,16.93,4.39,5.64,0,0,2.19,4.7

S . it Has  No Intention to Invade Ukraine,English,Russia,"Russia told the United States at tense talks Monday that it had no plans to invade Ukraine, as the two sides agreed to more efforts to keep tensions from turning into a full-blown confrontation. After more than seven hours of negotiations in Geneva, the Russian and U.S. negotiators both offered to keep talking, though there was no sign of a major breakthrough. The high-stakes negotiations came amid fears of a Russian invasion of its pro-Western neighbor Ukraine, and with Moscow demanding wide-ranging concessions from Washington and its NATO allies. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said he had assured his U.S. counterpart, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, that those fears were unfounded. ""We explained to our colleagues that we have no plans, no intentions to 'attack' Ukraine... There is no reason to fear any escalation in this regard,"" he told reporters after the talks. Ryabkov said the United States ""took Russian proposals very seriously"" and that Moscow was ""for the continuation of dialogue."" Sherman said that she offered to make reciprocal moves with Russia on missiles and exercises, but renewed warnings of major costs if Moscow invaded Ukraine. She said the United States was ready to meet again, but that Russia had not offered assurances that it will pull back troops amassed near Ukraine. And she insisted that some of Russia's demands were ""simply non-starters,"" including a ban on NATO's further eastward expansion. ""We will not allow anyone to slam closed NATO's open-door policy,"" Sherman said. Monday's talks in Geneva launched a week of diplomacy between Russia and the West after Moscow amassed tens of thousands of troops at the Ukrainian border, drawing the United States into a Cold War-style stand-off. Both sides have set firm lines, with Washington warning that Moscow would face severe diplomatic and economic consequences from an invasion of Ukraine, and Russia demanding broad new security arrangements with the West. After Monday's talks, a meeting of the NATO-Russia Council will take place in Brussels on Wednesday, then the permanent council of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) will meet in Vienna on Thursday with the issue of Ukraine expected to dominate. Sherman renewed a call on Russia to pull back its estimated 100,000 troops. If Russia invades, she said, ""there will be significant costs and consequences, well beyond what they faced in 2014,"" when Moscow seized the Crimean peninsula and backed an insurgency in eastern Ukraine. Ryabkov denounced U.S. threats as ""attempts at blackmail and intimidation,"" but said ""I don't think the situation is hopeless."" Any direct military action by the United States or NATO in defense of Ukraine is extremely unlikely. But Western officials have warned Moscow would face significant economic and financial consequences if it invades, and could see NATO boost its presence and capacities near Russia's borders. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Monday that the alliance would be warning Russia of the ""severe costs"" of an invasion. He said he did not expect this week's talks to ""solve all the issues,"" but wanted to kickstart a diplomatic process. ""We are aiming for an agreement on a way forward, a process, a series of meetings,"" Stoltenberg said before talks with Ukraine's deputy prime minister in Brussels. Measures against Russia under consideration include sanctions on President Vladimir Putin's inner circle, cancelling Russia's controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany or, in the most drastic scenario, severing Russia's links to the world's banking system. Moscow insists it was deceived after the Cold War and understood that NATO would not expand eastward. Instead, the U.S.-led alliance welcomed most of the former Warsaw Pact countries and the three Baltic nations that were under Soviet rule. Russia has put intense pressure on Ukraine since 2014 after a revolution overthrew a government that had sided with the Kremlin against moving closer to Europe. Russia seized the Crimean peninsula and backs an insurgency in eastern Ukraine in which more than 13,000 people have died. The heaviest of the fighting has subsided but clashes continue almost daily, with the Ukrainian army saying Monday that two of its soldiers died after an explosion from an unknown device. The army also accused separatist forces of firing at its positions with grenade launchers, machineguns and small arms. In the muddy trenches on the frontline, there was little hope for diplomacy. ""I doubt that anything will change,"" 29-year-old soldier Mykhailo said as he walked through trenches in the town of Avdiivka, just north of the separatist stronghold city of Donetsk. ""Guarantees of not joining NATO will never stop"" Putin, Mykhailo said, adding: ""He wants to return the Soviet Union in version 2.0.""",1,771,91.35,37.09,40.98,10.06,24.09,28.92,81.32,57.85,44.49,6.61,2.46,0.26,0.65,0,1.43,0.13,4.15,13.88,7.78,1.56,15.43,4.93,2.33,6.36,1.56,12.19,5.19,3.63,8.3,2.2,0.65,5.45,10.25,0.91,9.08,1.04,1.43,1.04,1.82,0.78,3.5,0,4.41,1.69,2.72,0.78,0.13,0.65,0.39,0.13,0.13,0,12.71,8.56,1.04,0.52,1.3,0.26,4.54,4.15,0,0,0.52,0.91,6.1,5.06,1.04,0,3.37,0,0.13,2.46,0.91,0,0.65,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.26,0,0.39,0.52,0,0,0,0,1.3,0,2.98,11.93,0.52,1.95,8.69,0.13,0.13,0.65,3.89,5.84,1.82,2.08,0,0,0,0,0,18.29,5.58,5.19,0,0,1.95,5.58

S .- Russian Security Talks : What We Know - The Moscow Times,English,Russia,"Russia and the United States held more than seven hours of tense talks in Geneva on Monday regarding Moscow’s sweeping set of demands from Washington and its NATO allies on their presence in Ukraine and other former Soviet countries. Both sides noted there was no breakthrough, but vowed to continue diplomatic efforts to diffuse tensions. Here’s what they discussed: – Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said he had assured his U.S. counterpart, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, that the fears of a Russian invasion of its pro-Western neighbor Ukraine were unfounded. – Sherman said Russia offered no proof it would not invade, nor any explanation for why it has deployed some 100,000 troops towards the Ukrainian border. – Sherman threatened sanctions on key Russian financial institutions, export controls targeting key industries, NATO enhancement and more security assistance to Kyiv if Russia invades Ukraine. – Ryabkov denounced the U.S. threats as ""attempts at blackmail and intimidation.” But he added: ""I don't think the situation is hopeless."" – Ryabkov sought “ironclad, legally binding” guarantees that Ukraine as well as the ex-Soviet republic of Georgia would never join the U.S.-led military bloc, saying the issue “is an absolute imperative” to Russia. – Sherman insisted that the demand is a ""non-starter,” saying “we will not allow anyone to slam closed NATO's open-door policy.” – Sherman offered reciprocal moves with Russia on de-escalation on missile placements and exercises. – Ryabkov reiterated Russia’s warning of a “military response through means at our discretion” if NATO deployed U.S. offensive weapons in Europe. “That will inevitably, unavoidably damage security of the U.S. and its European allies,” the AP quoted him as saying. – Ryabkov made clear that Russia was not interested in discussing the defunct INF Treaty, which had banned both sides from stationing short- and intermediate-range, land-based missiles in Europe, without the demands it has laid out in front of the U.S. and NATO. – Monday's talks in Geneva launched a week of “Strategic Security Dialogue” diplomacy between Russia and the West after Moscow's troop movements near Ukraine triggered a Cold War-style standoff. – A meeting of the NATO-Russia Council will take place in Brussels on Wednesday, then the permanent council of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) will meet in Vienna on Thursday with the issue of Ukraine expected to dominate. – The Kremlin called Monday's talks between the United States a ""positive"" start to continued dialogue, but noted that ""this is not a process for the sake of process... what's important here is the result. There is nothing to say yet about the result."" – Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko called the talks a ""moment of truth"" in Russia-NATO relations. ""Our expectations are entirely realistic and we hope that this will be a serious, deep conversation on key, fundamental problems of European security,"" Grushko said, referring to the talks in Brussels.

Meeting senior Kremlin envoys at their headquarters in Brussels, the NATO members said Moscow would have no veto on Ukraine or any other country joining the alliance, warning it would pay a high price if it invaded. ""Russia most of all will have to decide whether they really are about security, in which case they should engage, or whether this was all a pretext, and they may not even know yet,"" U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said. Putin's government has demanded the West to rule out accepting new members like Ukraine, Georgia or Finland on its eastern flank and has demanded limits on allied deployments in the former Soviet allies that joined NATO after the Cold War. Russia's massive troop build-up on Ukraine's borders has forced Washington to engage diplomatically — with bilateral security talks in Geneva on Monday, a NATO-Russia meeting on Wednesday and another planned at the OSCE in Vienna on Thursday. But the Western allies have received no promise that Russia will stand down its forces — which Moscow insists pose no threat to its already partially occupied neighbor — despite threatening massive economic sanctions if the Kremlin unleashes an invasion. Instead, the 30 member states invited the Russian envoys to return to Moscow and to advise Putin to join them for a series of confidence-building talks on limiting provocative military exercises, arms control and reciprocal limits on deploying missiles. ""Russia was not in a position to agree on that proposal. They didn't reject it either, but the Russian representatives made it clear that they needed some time to come back to NATO with an answer,"" alliance Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned: ""There are significant differences between NATO allies and Russia on these issues,"" he warned. Stoltenberg said it would be impossible for NATO members to agree to Moscow's core demands for a new security order in Europe, and in particular added that Russia would have no veto on Ukraine's right to eventually join the alliance. ""Ukraine as a sovereign nation... has the right to self-defense. Ukraine is not a threat to Russia,"" he said. ""It is Russia that is the aggressor. It is Russia that has used force and continues to use force against Ukraine. ""And then they're building up, with around 100,000 troops, artillery, armour, drones, tens of thousands of combat-ready troops and threatening rhetoric — that's the problem."" The West defends NATO's ""open-door policy"" towards potential future members, while Moscow is demanding a cast-iron guarantee that the alliance will not expand further towards its territory, seeing the westward tilt of one-time Warsaw Pact or Soviet allies as a threat. Before Wednesday, the NATO-Russia council had not met since 2019. NATO and Russia broke off practical cooperation in 2014 after Moscow occupied and annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea. Russia's diplomatic mission to the alliance was withdrawn in October last year after eight of its staff were expelled on allegations of espionage. But the former ambassador — now a deputy foreign minister — Alexander Grushko was back to confront Stoltenberg and Sherman, having earlier this week described the meeting as a ""moment of truth."" After the meeting, the senior U.S. diplomat said: ""Together, the United States and our NATO allies made clear we will not slam the door shut on NATO's open-door policy. ""NATO has never expanded through force or coercion or subversion. It is countries' sovereign choice to choose to come to NATO and say they want to join."" Just ahead of the talks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""The continuation of NATO's open-door policy and the further advancement of NATO towards our borders is precisely what, from our point of view, threatens us. ""This is exactly what we are asking not to continue through legally-binding guarantees."" The allies have threatened massive economic and financial sanctions against Moscow if its huge troop build-up on Ukraine's frontiers and in Russian-occupied Crimea turns into a new invasion. Peskov refused to be drawn on whether Russia could launch a military operation if denied. ""We would not like to throw around threats and ultimatums like American officials,"" he added. Russia has put intense pressure on Ukraine since 2014, after a revolution overthrew a government that had sided with the Kremlin against moving closer to Europe. Russia has seized and annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea and Moscow backs an insurgency in eastern Ukraine in which more than 13,000 people have died.",1,763,88.21,41.61,53.56,7.34,24.61,28.57,81.91,57.4,46,6.95,2.49,0,0.92,0,0.39,1.18,4.46,12.19,7.08,1.05,16.12,6.55,1.83,6.95,1.83,12.45,5.24,2.75,11.4,4.98,0.26,6.16,11.66,0.92,10.62,0.79,1.57,1.31,1.83,0.79,5.5,0,4.85,1.7,3.15,0.13,0,0.13,0,0.13,0,0,13.76,8.52,2.36,0.26,2.1,0,3.15,6.68,0,0,0,0.52,6.16,5.11,1.05,0,2.36,0,0.13,1.57,0.66,0,0.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.13,0.39,0.13,0.26,0,0,0,0,2.1,0.13,4.19,9.83,0.39,1.44,7.99,0.26,0,0.13,4.59,4.46,3.67,1.7,0.26,0,0.26,0,0,16.51,4.85,4.46,0,0,1.97,5.24

The Defense Ministry said 3,000 troops and 300 tanks and infantry fighting vehicles have been deployed across three western Russian regions bordering Ukraine and one bordering Belarus. The military’s Western Military District said the motorized rifle drills will involve T-72B3 main battle tanks and BMP-2 infantry fighting vehicles. The drills stretch across western Russia’s Voronezh, Belgorod, Bryansk and Smolensk regions. Late in December, Russia completed 10,000-troop drills across southern regions that included Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014. Russia’s announcement Tuesday — marking its second live fire exercises near Ukrainian borders in a month — came one day after Russian and U.S. diplomats held strategic security talks to try to de-escalate tensions. One of the key de-escalation issues offered by Washington was mutually limiting military exercises and deploying missiles in Europe. The U.S. State Department on Tuesday said Russia’s exercises go “in exactly the opposite direction” of de-escalation. The West has for months raised alarm over Russian military buildup near Ukraine and fears of a Russian invasion of its ally. Moscow denies planning an invasion and says moving troops and holding military drills within its borders is its right. The U.S. State Department said Russia offered no proof it would not invade or any explanation for why it has deployed some 100,000 troops toward the Ukrainian border. “These kind of deployments, 100,000 troops out of barracks and on the Ukrainian border, are extremely expensive,” Under Secretary of State Victoria Nuland said during Tuesday’s briefing. “As is the deployment of this kind of weaponry in the cold winter.” The Ukrainian president’s spokesman welcomed ""the intent and efforts of the United States and Russia, and NATO and Russia to reduce tensions and resolve all mutual issues at the negotiating table."" Monday’s negotiations in Geneva offered no breakthrough, with the next round of dialogue moving to NATO headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday.

",English,Russia,"Russia ruled out Sunday any concession at talks with the United States on soaring tensions over Ukraine, as Moscow, facing strong pressure to pull back troops, seeks a wide-ranging new security arrangement with the West. Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told Russian news agencies ahead of his talks in Geneva the Kremlin was ""disappointed"" with signals coming from Washington and from Brussels, where NATO and the European Union are based. The high-level discussions kick off a week of diplomacy in which Russia will meet with NATO and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), as the United States tries to assure European allies they will not be sidelined. Since late last year, Russia has amassed tens of thousands of troops at the Ukrainian border and demanded guarantees that NATO will not expand further eastward. The Kremlin is insisting NATO must never grant membership to ex-Soviet Ukraine, which is pushing to join. The United States, to be represented by Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, agreed to talks even though it made plain that many of Moscow's proposals are non-starters. Originally scheduled to start on Monday, Sherman is now due to have a working dinner with Ryabkov on Sunday evening, said a State Department spokesperson. Russia's Foreign Ministry posted footage of Ryabkov's plane arriving in Geneva. ""We will not agree to any concession. That is completely excluded,"" Ryabkov said before departing. ""We are disappointed with the signals coming in the last few days from Washington but also from Brussels."" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, dismissing Moscow's demands as ""gaslighting"", has insisted that talks will yield no progress so long as Russia has a ""gun to Ukraine's head."" ""We're prepared to respond forcefully to further Russian aggression. But a diplomatic solution is still possible and preferable if Russia chooses it,"" Blinken said Friday. Russian President Vladimir Putin met his US counterpart Joe Biden in Geneva in June and agreed on regular ""stability"" talks between Sherman and Ryabkov. In two phone calls to Putin, Biden has warned of severe consequences if Russia invades Ukraine. Measures under consideration include sanctions on Putin's inner circle, cancelling Russia's controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany or, in the most drastic scenario, severing Russia's links to the world's banking system. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, warned that Washington would also send more troops to eastern NATO members such as Poland and the Baltic states if Russia invaded Ukraine. Europeans have showed solidarity, with EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell visiting the frontline in Ukraine, although some nations are expected to hesitate at the strongest measures. ""Whatever the solution, Europe has to be involved,"" EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said. Russia insists it was deceived after the Cold War and understood that NATO would not expand. Instead, the U.S.-led alliance welcomed most of the former Warsaw Pact countries and the three Baltic nations that were under Soviet rule. Russia has put intense pressure on Ukraine since 2014 after a revolution overthrew a government that had sided with the Kremlin against moving closer to Europe. Russia seized the Crimean peninsula and backs an insurgency in eastern Ukraine in which more than 13,000 people have died. At a time when Russia is also intervening to shore up allies facing popular uprisings in Belarus and Kazakhstan, Moscow has insisted it wants concrete progress in talks with Washington. Putin's foreign policy adviser Yury Ushakov warned after the call with Biden that the United States would make a ""colossal mistake"" if it went ahead with sanctions. ""It is very likely that we will encounter the reticence of our U.S. and NATO colleagues to really perceive what we need,"" Ryabkov said Sunday. In spite ""of the threats that are constantly formulated against us ... we wil make no concession,"" he said, adding it would ""amount to acting against the interests of our seccurity."" NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg, meeting foreign ministers of the alliance on Friday, said there remained real risks of a Russian invasion. But John Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, described the Russian troop build-up as a ""gigantic bluff"" by Putin to seek a negotiated agreement. ""They are trying to see if the Biden administration or Europe will blink,"" said Herbst, now at the Atlantic Council think tank. ""As long as the Biden administration remains at least as strong as it is now,"" he said, ""it probably is enough to keep Putin from striking large into Ukraine, but I don't rule out something smaller."" Matthew Rojansky, director of the Kennan Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, said the Geneva talks were more about preventing the Ukraine crisis from accelerating than reaching a major deal.",1,787,91.77,46.83,34.22,13.43,23.15,29.22,77.76,57.18,43.33,5.46,2.16,0.13,1.27,0,0.51,0.25,3.3,11.18,6.99,0.76,16.39,5.97,2.8,6.35,1.02,13.85,5.72,2.92,7.62,3.05,0.89,3.68,10.17,0.38,9.66,1.02,1.4,1.27,1.78,1.02,3.68,0,3.18,1.27,1.91,0.51,0,0.51,0,0.25,0.25,0,11.31,6.99,0.64,0.25,0.51,0.13,4.45,4.7,0,0,0,0.51,7.37,5.97,1.27,0.13,3.05,0,0,3.05,0.13,0,0.38,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.13,0.13,0.38,0.13,0.13,0,0.13,0,0,1.4,0.13,3.43,9.15,0.76,1.65,6.48,0.25,0,0.25,4.7,3.94,4.45,2.16,0.13,0,0.13,0,0,17.92,5.84,5.34,0,0,1.65,5.08

Putin delivered his annual holiday greetings hours after speaking with U.S. President Joe Biden, who warned the Russian leader of a “decisive” response to any invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin chief meanwhile cautioned Biden that sanctions would be a “colossal mistake” and lead to a collapse in Russian-U.S. relations. Pandemic toll Russia recorded more than 115,000 excess deaths during November 2021 according to official statistics published Thursday — a new record high since the start of the pandemic. The number takes Russia’s overall excess death count since the start of the pandemic to 929,000, according to The Moscow Times’ analysis. Calculations based on official statistics for January-November and preliminary data for December say Russia’s Covid-19 death toll is the second-highest in the world behind the United States. Foreign agents Russia on Thursday added members of the Pussy Riot protest group Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Nika Nikulshina, prominent satirist Viktor Shenderovich, independent journalist Taisiya Bekbulatova and former Kremlin advisor Marat Gelman to its registry of “foreign agents.” The Justice Ministry's registry now includes more than 100 entities and individuals, most of which were added in 2021 Tsirkon test The Russian Navy’s Northern Fleet said on Friday that it had carried out a 10th overall test of the Tsirkon hypersonic cruise missile from a frigate.

Fatal crash Five people died and 21 were injured in a bus accident near the village of Voslebovo in the Ryazan region south of Moscow on Sunday, Russian authorities said. The Federal Road Traffic Inspection agency published photographs of the badly damaged coach, which hit a pillar under a railway bridge. The front of the bus appeared to be entirely crushed.

According to the Levada Center pollster, 44% of Russian respondents said they expected the political situation to worsen in the coming months. Likewise, 49% said they expect the same for Russia’s economy. Only 18% and 16%, respectively, said they expected Russia’s political and economic life to improve in 2022. More than half of the respondents expressed skepticism toward the Russian government’s ability to improve the overall domestic situation, compared with two out of five who expressed confidence. When asked to assess Russia’s current political climate — which has seen an unprecedented crackdown on the non-systemic opposition over the past year — 47% of respondents called it “tense” and 12% called it “explosive.” Only 7% called the political situation “safe” and 32% called it “calm,” according to Levada. The independent polling agency’s results reflect the general mood among Russians as Moscow seeks to wrangle security concessions from the United States and NATO amid a post-Cold War freeze in relations. The U.S. warns of an imminent Russian invasion of Ukraine and has threatened tough sanctions, including on key Russian industries, in response. While Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine led to a surge in domestic approval for the country's leadership, it also sparked harsh sanctions from the West.

The high-stakes negotiations come amid fears of a Russian invasion of its pro-Western neighbor Ukraine, and with Moscow demanding wide-ranging concessions from Washington and its NATO allies. Monday's talks in Geneva launch a week of diplomacy between Russia and the West after Moscow amassed tens of thousands of troops at the Ukrainian border, drawing the United States into a Cold War-style stand-off. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov opened their meeting at the U.S. mission in Geneva at 8:55 a.m. (07:55 GMT). A convoy of black vehicles with Russian diplomatic plates had arrived shortly before, and was ushered through the large iron gates under a billowing U.S. flag. The two diplomats had already met informally in the Swiss city on Sunday evening, with Ryabkov afterwards telling Russian news agencies the first meeting had been ""difficult."" State news agency RIA Novosti on Monday quoted Ryabkov saying he feared Washington was not taking seriously Moscow's demand of an end to NATO's eastward expansion. Pointing to a 2008 promise by NATO to consider membership for Ukraine and others, Ryabkov said: ""Are they ready to give legal guarantees that this country, as well as other countries... will not join NATO?"" ""I have a rather pessimistic forecast in this regard."" Sherman said on Twitter that the talks were underway but there would be little progress without others at the table. ""The U.S. will listen to Russia's concerns and share our own, but we have been clear we will not discuss European security without our allies and partners,"" she said. Sherman in the talks on Sunday had stressed ""the freedom of sovereign nations to choose their own alliances,"" the State Department said. In the muddy trenches on the frontline in Ukraine, where Kyiv's forces have been battling pro-Russian fighters since 2014, there was little hope for diplomacy. ""I doubt that anything will change,"" 29-year-old soldier Mykhailo said as he walked through trenches in the town of Avdiivka, just north of the separatist stronghold city of Donetsk. ""Guarantees of not joining NATO will never stop"" Russian President Vladimir Putin, Mykhailo said, adding: ""He wants to return the Soviet Union in version 2.0."" Both sides have set firm lines, with Washington warning that Moscow would face severe diplomatic and economic consequences from an invasion of Ukraine, and Russia demanding wide-ranging new security arrangements with the West. After Monday's talks, a meeting of the NATO-Russia Council will take place in Brussels on Wednesday, then the permanent council of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) will meet in Vienna on Thursday with the issue of Ukraine expected to dominate. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken stressed Sunday that Russia had to choose between dialogue and confrontation, warning on CNN that there would be ""massive consequences for Russia if it renews its aggression on Ukraine."" Blinken warned that any positive outcome from the talks would rely in part on Russia's willingness to stand down from its aggressive posture, which he likened to ""an atmosphere of escalation with a gun to Ukraine's head."" Any direct military action by the United States or NATO in defense of Ukraine is extremely unlikely. But Western officials have warned Moscow would face significant economic and financial consequences if it invades, and could see NATO boost its presence and capacities near Russia's borders. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Monday that the alliance would be warning Russia of the ""severe costs"" of an invasion. He said he did not expect this week's talks to ""solve all the issues,"" but wanted to kickstart a diplomatic process. ""We are aiming for an agreement on a way forward, a process, a series of meetings,"" Stoltenberg said before talks with Ukraine's deputy prime minister in Brussels. Measures against Russia under consideration include sanctions on Putin's inner circle, canceling Russia's controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany or, in the most drastic scenario, severing Russia's links to the world's banking system. Moscow insists it was deceived after the Cold War and understood that NATO would not expand eastward. Instead, the U.S.-led alliance welcomed most of the former Warsaw Pact countries and the three Baltic nations that were under Soviet rule. Russia has put intense pressure on Ukraine since 2014 after a revolution overthrew a government that had sided with the Kremlin against moving closer to Europe. Russia seized the Crimean peninsula and backs an insurgency in eastern Ukraine in which more than 13,000 people have died. ""The Cold War is over, and so are spheres of influence,"" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted ahead of Monday's talks. ""Putin's demands are illegitimate and harmful to international peace and security.""",1,808,93.89,37.22,36.46,7.82,24.48,30.45,80.07,56.31,43.69,5.45,2.1,0.25,0.62,0,0.87,0.37,3.34,12,7.67,1.86,16.34,5.94,2.23,5.69,0.87,12.38,5.69,2.72,7.18,2.48,0.37,4.33,9.16,0.25,8.79,0.74,1.24,1.49,1.36,0.62,3.71,0,4.33,1.49,2.85,1.24,0.25,0.99,0.5,0.37,0,0,11.51,7.8,0.87,0.74,0.74,0.12,4.46,3.71,0,0,0.12,0.74,6.56,5.32,1.24,0,3.34,0,0.12,2.72,0.62,0,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.12,0.37,0.5,0.37,0,0,0,0,1.86,0,2.35,10.77,0.74,1.11,8.42,0.25,0.12,0.5,4.33,5.2,2.23,1.86,0.12,0.12,0,0,0,18.81,6.19,4.21,0.12,0,2.23,6.06

Here’s what we know about the NATO-Russia Council talks in Brussels: ‘No positive agenda’ – NATO rejected Russia's demand for a new security settlement in Europe, challenging President Vladimir Putin to withdraw troops deployed near Ukraine and join talks on reducing the threat of open conflict. – The Western allies received no promise that Russia will stand down its forces — which Moscow insists pose no threat to its already partially occupied neighbor — despite the threat of economic sanctions. – Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko said the “frank, direct, deep, intense” talks revealed “a large number of differences on fundamental issues.” – He said that Russia and NATO had no ""positive agenda — none at all"" and warned that the continued deterioration could lead to the ""most unpredictable and most dire consequences for European security.” Arms control – Grushko told reporters that Russia was ready for dialogue on not deploying intermediate-range missiles in Europe, mutual limits on military exercises and ways to prevent accidental encounters. – He pointed out that the confidence-building measures are included in Russia’s sweeping list of demands and proposals that forced Western allies to meet Russian envoys this week. – “The Russian side has repeatedly offered the alliance to take measures to de-escalate the situation. The Russian initiatives have been ignored by [NATO’s] side. This creates conditions for incidents and conflicts and undermines the foundations of security,"" the Defense Ministry said in a statement published by the state-run RIA Novosti news agency. Ukraine – Grushko called on NATO to stop sending military aid and arms supplies to Kyiv to de-escalate the current tensions. He maintained that Moscow's proposals, where a ban on Ukraine’s future NATO membership is a central tenet, could in fact improve security of both Russia and NATO members. – In response to NATO’s rejection of Russia’s demand to veto Ukraine’s membership aspirations, Grushko said that “the freedom to choose ways of ensuring one’s security mustn’t be implemented in a way that infringes on legitimate security interests of others.” Future talks – NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said “both Russia and NATO allies expressed the need to resume dialogue and to explore a schedule of future meetings.” – He said the U.S.-led alliance was ready to reopen its missions in Moscow four months after Russia suspended them in retaliation to NATO’s expulsion of Russian envoys over spying accusations. Putin invite – NATO invited the Russian envoys to return to Moscow and to advise Putin to join them for a series of confidence-building talks on limiting provocative military exercises, arms control and reciprocal limits on deploying missiles. – Stoltenberg said Russia’s envoys did not reject the offer. “Russia was not in a position to agree on that proposal…, but the Russian representatives made it clear that they needed some time to come back to NATO with an answer.” AFP contributed reporting.",1,502,96.6,44.78,13.14,17.9,26.42,32.87,79.48,53.78,39.84,5.98,1.59,0,0.2,0,0.8,0.6,4.38,13.35,7.17,0.6,16.14,3.39,0.8,3.78,1.79,10.16,5.58,4.38,8.96,2.59,1.39,5.18,8.17,1.2,6.77,1,1.79,1.39,0,0.2,1.79,0,4.58,2.19,2.39,0.2,0,0.2,0,0.2,0,0,14.94,11.55,2.39,0,1.99,0.4,5.38,4.18,0,0,0,0.8,5.78,3.98,1.79,0,2.99,0,0.4,2.39,0.2,0,0.6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.6,0.2,0.4,0,0,0,0,2.59,0.8,3.78,9.16,1.2,0.8,7.17,0.2,0,0.2,3.39,5.18,2.59,1.79,0.2,0,0.2,0,0,15.34,4.38,2.19,0,0,2.99,5.78

Russia’s military build-up on the Ukrainian border has set the world on edge, raising fears of an invasion. In neighboring Belarus, the Kremlin has moved closer to fully-fledged integration with the country, whose embattled strongman President Alexander Lukashenko looks increasingly isolated from the West. Looking west, the jailing of Kremlin-critic Alexei Navalny further strained relations with Europe, while across the Atlantic, the election of Joe Biden fundamentally changed the course of American foreign policy toward Russia. Russia also tried to extend its global footprint, by cooperating with post-coup Myanmar and Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. And as the world continued to struggle with the coronavirus pandemic, Russia attempted to boost its global image through “vaccine diplomacy,” but inconsistent vaccine production and a murky middle-man selling vaccines in the developing world ultimately led to a string of scandals that did Russia’s reputation more harm than good. What does Russia hope to achieve in 2022? The Moscow Times asked 10 leading experts in Russian foreign policy to give their predictions for the coming year. Russia-China relations will deepen in 2022 Alexander Gabuev, senior fellow and chair of the Russia in Asia-Pacific Program at the Carnegie Moscow Center Two years of the pandemic have shown the resilience of Russia-China ties. In 2021, trade volume grew to nearly $140 billion, setting another historic record. This figure reflects not only high commodities prices this year, but also increased shipments of natural gas via the “Power of Siberia” pipeline and growth in volumes of Russian coal exports to China. In 2022 this trend is likely to continue, although exact trade volumes will be subject to volatile global prices. As China shifts away from domestic coal to cleaner fuels like gas, and Russia seeks to monetize its natural resources, Moscow and Beijing might find more joint projects. Some of them will be unveiled during Vladimir Putin’s trip to Beijing in February, with a new contract for the “Power of Siberia 2” gas pipeline as the crown jewel. The political environment is also benevolent to the further deepening of China-Russia ties. Moscow’s conflict with the West is not going away, as demonstrated by recent events in Ukraine, raising the prospect of more U.S. and EU sanctions against Russia. Beijing’s confrontation with the U.S. is also here to stay, even if the White House gets distracted by events in Europe or elsewhere. Despite some predictions, China-Russia entente is far from its peak, and 2022 is likely to serve as another testament to this. Keeping the Middle East “stable in its instability” Mariana Belenskaya, Middle East correspondent for the Russian daily Kommersant ​​It seems that Russian foreign policy is no longer focused on the Middle East, as it was for several years after the start of the military campaign in Syria. Russia is now moving along a familiar path — the situation is “stable in its instability” but Moscow has restored its authority in the region, established ties and assigned roles. The general task for next year is to increase trade with the countries of the region — including by expanding the grain market — and maintaining interest in Russian weapons. Syria, which will remain Russia’s zone of responsibility for many years to come, is still a separate set of issues. It is important that the pacified territories do not once again turn into hotbeds of confrontation and that no global powers initiate new operations in the country. In addition, Russia hopes that Syria will gradually emerge from its international isolation. For its part, Moscow will continue trying to rebuild Syria’s infrastructure, at least to the extent that it can do so alone. Russia might need to pay close attention to Libya, where it remains unclear how events will develop. Moscow maintains close contact with all the parties in the Libyan conflict but does not seek a central role in resolving the problems there — at least for as long as the situation does not become critical. Two regional problems will require particular attention next year — the “Iranian nuclear dossier” and Afghanistan. The latter has become more strongly linked to the Middle East now that Turkey and Qatar have taken an interest in it. As for Iran, Moscow will do everything in its power to bring all parties back to the Iran nuclear deal — the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action — as it existed prior to Washington’s withdrawal from it in 2018. Indeed, the answer to the question of whether a Nuclear Deal 2.0 will appear and how it will look largely depends on how events will transpire in the Middle East and what role each party in the region will play. Peace in Ukraine is a victory in itself Andrei Kortunov, director-general of the Russian International Affairs Council It is hard to envisage a breakthrough or even significant progress in relations between Russia and Ukraine in 2022. The definition of success would be the ability of the sides to avoid direct military confrontation in Donbass, in the Azov Sea or along the Russian-Ukrainian border. The current political dynamic between Kiev and in Moscow is not conducive to the flexibility needed to move ahead with the implementation of the Minsk Agreements. At the same time, the change of government in Germany and the forthcoming presidential election in France make it very hard for the European members of the Normandy process to exercise the leadership needed to overcome the current stalemate. One could expect the Biden administration to become a more active player in the situation around Ukraine in 2022, but the odds are that White House attention will be focused on ongoing U.S.-China rivalry and the Ukrainian crisis will remain a relatively low priority for Washington. Still, de-escalation is possible, as well as a new Russian-Ukrainian agreement for gas transit. If these modest goals are achieved in 2022, we might see less hostile and belligerent rhetoric coming out of Moscow and Kiev. Further uneasy integration with Lukashenko in Belarus Artyom Shraibman, Belarussian journalist and political commentator for the Carnegie Moscow Center Russia's strategic goals in Belarus have remained unchanged for many years. Moscow, at minimum, wants to prevent the rapprochement of Minsk with the West, and at maximum, to strengthen its own influence in Belarus, which could outlive Alexander Lukashenko. Further institutionalization of such dependence will be the plan for 2022. This includes promoting bilateral integration within the Union State, increasing Russian military presence in Belarus, and “helping” Minsk to reorient its trade flows toward Russia in response to Western sanctions. Not all of those ambitions will necessarily materialize, as Lukashenko retains some bargaining power. For several years now, Moscow has been approaching financial support for Lukashenka conservatively. The volume of indirect subsidies, discounts on gas and oil and loans are either decreasing or not growing. The Kremlin gives Lukashenko as much as is necessary to keep his regime afloat, but the idea of more generous investment in Belarus has long been unpopular in Moscow. At the same time, one should not expect Putin to exert tough pressure on Lukashenko in order to speed up the transfer of power in Belarus. At best, the Kremlin might be ready to push the friendly regime toward controlled transformation, but Russians will not actively undermine Lukashenko’s rule. Moscow's long-standing problem with Belarus is the lack of reliable alternatives to Lukashenko. Despite Biden-Putin respect, Ukraine means a bumpy ride in relations with America Vladimir Frolov, political columnist and former Russian diplomat In 2022, the U.S. and Russia will test the resilience of the respectful adversarial relationship they have transitioned to after the Geneva summit last June. “The spirit of Geneva” has helped keep confrontation at an acceptable level through dialogue on strategic stability and cyber threats and with regular interaction between national security advisors. The presidential talks have demonstrated grudging respect and an ability to communicate grievances and threats clearly, but calmly, while opening new avenues for dialogue. Washington dangles inconclusive talks to curb Russian unpredictability, while Moscow views engaging with Biden as the best way to address Russia’s long-ignored concerns without changing course. There is even a rare U.S.-Russia mind-meld over the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) Iran nuclear deal negotiations, with Iran’s intransigence providing the incentives. Disagreements, however, will remain. The stand-off over bilateral diplomatic presence has degenerated into the grotesque, with spy agencies unable to agree on rules for acceptable espionage activity. Resolving the impasse will require Moscow to remove its designation of the U.S. as a “hostile power.” Ukraine, NATO enlargement and Russia’s rightful place in the European security order will remain the key battlegrounds in 2022. Moscow harbors great expectations after Biden’s promise to discuss Russia’s concerns over NATO enlargement “among the five major NATO allies” signaling acceptance of Moscow’s preferred format on European security. In Ukraine, Russia’s demands have moved beyond the implementation of the Minsk agreements and are now in “Finlandization territory.” Moscow’s insistence on legally binding guarantees of the definitive end to NATO enlargement in the former Soviet Union has narrowed the scope for face-saving diplomacy. Biden will have a short time frame in 2022 to negotiate an acceptable accommodation with Putin on Ukraine and European security. Russia’s posture is unlikely to change before significant diplomatic progress towards meeting Moscow’s objectives. It will be a rough ride. Crucial elections in Latin America could tilt the balance of power in Russia’s favor Vladimir Rouvinski, professor at Icesi University in Colombia In 2021, Russia managed to position itself as one of the major suppliers of the Covid-19 vaccine to the region, although mainly supporting countries with friendly relations to Moscow Meanwhile, key Russia ally President Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela, not only survived 2021 but also started strengthening his position in the region thanks to a new left-wing wave on the continent. In the coming year, Russia will be closely watching several important presidential elections, including Colombia, where a left-wing candidate is projected to be the likely winner. In Brazil, the very popular left-wing former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is expected to announce his bid for the presidency in early 2022. Wins for both left-wing candidates will dramatically change the Latin American political map and open new opportunities for Moscow to strengthen its ties in the Western Hemisphere. However, Russia also faces challenges. One of them is the shortage of tangible resources to support its allies in this part of the world. This is most evident in Cuba, where the situation is deteriorating rapidly and Moscow has so far provided minimal aid. The continuous tensions with Washington over Ukraine may incentivize reciprocity-driven Russia to pay more attention to Cuba, located just 129 kilometers (80 miles) from the U.S border. No easy answers in Europe Anton Barbashin, editorial director of Riddle Russia It is almost impossible, looking at the end of 2021, to see a bright future for EU-Russia relations in 2022. The best case scenario is that they won’t get much worse. We can point to three major themes that will define this relationship next year — Ukraine, Belarus and the future of gas. In each of these cases the EU’s goal is to minimize damage, while Russia will undoubtedly be ready to up the risk-taking, assuming the EU will be the first to blink. The most heated and potentially most devastating is the tension over Ukraine and the role of NATO in European security. While Moscow certainly blames Paris and Berlin for failing to press Minsk II and is now betting on Washington, it will be the EU that will have to pick up what’s left after the likely fallout. The blow might be softened by prompt Nord Stream 2 certification, but as of now it looks like stable gas prices are not in the basic scenario for 2022. Peaceful or not, 2022 will not be relaxing. Will the Arctic remain the sole region of cooperation in 2022? Elizabeth Buchanan, lecturer in strategic studies with Deakin University at the Australian War College Will 2022 mark the end of the Arctic’s “low tension” post-Cold War run or will the Arctic remain “isolated” from Russian-Western strategic tensions elsewhere? Pundits worldwide will no doubt keep a watchful eye on any potential spillover from Russia’s current Ukraine trajectory into the Arctic. Since 2014, Russian-Western ties in the Arctic have remained largely cooperative, indeed even collaborative via multilateral vehicles like the Arctic Council. Russia knows that the future economic resource base of the country does not rest on its Eastern European doorstep, but on its Arctic frontier. Plunging the Russian Arctic Zone into conflict is therefore not part of Russia’s strategic playbook. Working to silo the Arctic from tensions far beyond the region will remain a lynchpin of Kremlin security planning and outlook. The real geopolitical and strategic gains and achievements for Moscow in the Arctic will remain nested in Russia’s bilateral energy engagements. In 2022, I expect an enhanced diversification strategy with regard to Russia’s economic partners and stakeholders in its various Arctic energy ventures. Bilateral Arctic ties with India will be central to offsetting any Russian overreliance on Chinese capital. Russia will try to gain from the Taliban’s threat in Central Asia Temur Umarov, research consultant at Carnegie Moscow Center focusing on Central Asia In 2022, security concerns in Afghanistan will continue to be the priority for Moscow in Central Asia. Russia will see a window of opportunity to regain its reputation — which is being challenged by China — as the only reliable security guarantor in Central Asia against the uncertainties that the Taliban regime brings. This means that in the upcoming year Russia will intensify its cooperation with the security agencies in Central Asian nations. Russia will also be hoping to push through its integration projects with countries previously skeptical of joining. Uzbekistan, for instance, is now seriously considering joining the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union. Overall, Russia’s leadership will want to see a stable and safe Central Asia in the next several years. The closer we move toward 2024 presidential elections, the less energy the Kremlin will have for anything other than its domestic issues. Moscow will therefore try its best to help the political leaders in Central Asia to become stronger and more stable. However, this is not going to be an easy task, especially in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. More than symbolism at the 2022 Russia-Africa Summit Andrey Maslov, head of the Center for African Studies at Moscow's Higher School of Economics, with researcher for Intexpertise LLC Sviridov Vsevolod The volume of Russian-African trade increased this year for the first time since 2018, diversifying both geographically and in the range of goods traded. Shipments of railway equipment, fertilizers, pipes, high-tech equipment and aluminum are growing and work continues on institutionalizing the interaction between Russia and the African Union. The second Russia-Africa Summit is planned for 2022. In February it will be announced where and when it will be held — most likely in Russia in November — and in which format. Preparations for the second summit will shape the Russian-African agenda, visits will become more frequent and Africa will receive greater coverage in Russian media. Instead of measuring the success of the summit by how many African leaders attended, as happened in 2019, the parties will finally give greater attention to the substance of the agenda, which is already under development. Russia will try to increase its presence in Africa while avoiding direct confrontation with other non-regional players. A number of conflicts are also causing alarm, primarily those in Ethiopia and in Mali, from which France and the EU are withdrawing their troops. In 2022, Russia will try in various ways to play a stabilizing role for Africa and assist in confronting the main challenges it faces — epidemics, the spread of extremism and conflicts, and hunger. A dialogue will also begin on Africa formulating its own climate agenda. Africa is beginning to understand that it does not need a European-style green agenda and will demand compensation from the main polluting countries for the damage the climatic changes have caused to the ecosystems of African countries. Russia is likely to support these demands.",1,2686,95.99,27.84,53.59,39.79,24.2,31.09,79.08,57.86,45.31,3.95,0.56,0.04,0.11,0.04,0.11,0.22,3.39,13.1,8.45,2.01,17.42,6.44,2.94,5.17,0.86,10.2,8.23,3.46,6.66,1.23,2.08,3.46,8.75,0.3,8.41,1.45,0.93,0.86,1.68,0.48,3.09,0,4.69,3.02,1.68,0.82,0.3,0.52,0.15,0.34,0,0,5.25,3.28,1.01,0.19,0.82,0.11,0.67,1.6,0,0.04,0,0.11,4.36,2.57,1.6,0.19,3.43,0.26,0.15,2.23,0.93,0.11,0.6,0.37,0.34,0,0,0,0,0.04,0.04,0.48,0.19,0.3,0.07,0,0,0.45,0.74,0.04,3.43,12.62,0.56,1.04,10.13,0.78,0,0.37,3.83,1.19,3.54,3.76,0.07,0.04,0.04,0,0,12.96,4.54,4.36,0.11,0,1.23,2.72

Russia’s lead negotiator said he saw “no reason” to renew talks anytime soon, adding that the U.S. had shown no flexibility regarding Moscow’s demands to veto Ukrainian membership in the NATO alliance and roll back NATO’s troop and equipment deployments in central and eastern Europe. The ruble fell by almost 3% against the U.S. dollar following the comments, while Russia’s leading stock market lost more than 4% in ruble terms. The Russian currency was trading at 76.4 against the U.S. dollar on Thursday evening in Moscow, and had fallen to 87.6 against the euro. Russia’s dollar-denominated stock market, the RTS index, lost 6% with commodities companies among the biggest fallers. “The market has had its head in the sand about Russia-related geopolitical risks and is just waking up now,” said emerging markets bond trader Timothy Ash in a note to clients. Russian markets have been relatively quiet since the start of the year, despite the precarious security situation and comments from all sides that there is a serious risk of military escalation. Traders “may be realizing that Moscow is just going through the motions on the diplomatic front now but it is set on war,” Ash added. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said in an interview with the Russian-language channel RTVI that he was awaiting a substantive response from the West to draft treaties presented by Moscow at the end of last year before Moscow would contemplate another round of talks. “Another deterioration in the geopolitical situation has increased country risks and the corresponding discount in ruble assets,” said Dmitry Babin, stock market expert with Moscow-based brokerage BCS Investments. “Against this backdrop, the decline is likely to continue, at least in the short-term.” Also weighing on market sentiment Thursday was a draft U.S. bill outlining hard-hitting sanctions on the Russian economy that would result from Moscow taking further military steps against Ukraine. Moscow has hit back at Washington’s plans and ruled out calls to de-escalate the situation Thursday following the failure of high-level diplomatic talks earlier in the week. “Russia is not even ready to discuss the U.S.’ absolutely unacceptable demand for Russian troops to return to their barracks,” Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said, referring to calls from the U.S. for Moscow to withdraw some of the 100,000 troops it has stationed near the border with Ukraine. Talks between Moscow, Washington and NATO in Europe this week have failed to move the sides closer to a resolution of what Moscow has called “large and fundamental differences.” Moscow wants legal guarantees that NATO will never admit Ukraine as a member and has called for troop deployments across the alliance to be rolled back to 1997 positions, before the bloc expanded into eastern Europe. The U.S. has branded the proposals a “non-starter,” and high-level talks in Geneva and Brussels this week have not managed to bring the sides closer together.

The point is that they are talking, but are they speaking the same language? The mood music out of Geneva was as good as could have been expected in that the door is still open; although it is still unclear if anything will come through it. Moscow’s point man, First Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, said that “the conversation was difficult, long, very professional, deep, concrete, without attempts to embellish anything, to avoid any sharp corners,” but he allowed that “the American side took the Russian proposals very seriously.” On the specific issue of Ukraine, he said “we explained to our colleagues that we have no plans, no intentions, to ‘attack’ Ukraine … There is no reason to fear any escalation in this regard.” His U.S. counterpart, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, likewise characterized the talks as “serious” and “business-like,” but added “it is on Russia to de-escalate tensions,” which is at once true and yet also at the root of the problem. In part, this is about a fundamental disconnect between how Russia and the West see the situation. Washington wants to make this an issue of broader “strategic stability,” a route back into discussions about arms control and nuclear policy. Moscow is not specifically against this, but believes that talking about strategic stability in the present situation is like getting involved in comparison-shopping for burglar alarms when an intruder is already prising open the windows to your bedroom. It is an important but secondary and longer-term issue, to be resolved later, compared with an immediate threat from NATO. The West does not seem to be able to accept that — however nonsensical it may seem — the old men in the Kremlin truly do believe that NATO poses a threat, not necessarily in conventional military terms, but as a hostile alliance committed to constraining and even undermining Russia. This, after all, speaks to the arguably even more important point of the equally fundamental contrast between how the two sides feel about the situation and the talks. To Washington, these are pragmatic crisis talks to defuse a dangerous situation generated by the Kremlin’s unrealistic fears and ambitions. From some conversations I have had with people involved, the impression is of a police officer trying to negotiate a hostage situation. There is an innocent victim who has to be protected — Ukraine — there is a wild-eyed criminal with a knife at the victim’s throat — Russia — and there is the American cop, hoping to calm the miscreant, but with the threat of the SWAT team’s snipers at his back if things escalate. There may be some sad or traumatic backstory that made the knife-wielder what he is today, but that is not really the cop’s concern. For Moscow, I feel these are more like divorce negotiations at the end of a long, increasingly bitter marriage. On one level, the Kremlin may know that it is acting out, but it feels it has no alternative way of getting through to its smug, dishonest ex-partner, who cheated and lied, yet still believes it has a legitimate claim to both the kids and the beach house, as well as to feel morally superior for whatever pittance they leave in the settlement. In this context, the problem is precisely that negotiations over practical issues become intertwined with the psycho-drama of years of growing animosity. The breach of promises made to Gorbachev that NATO would move not an inch eastwards, Kosovo, Libya, the way the European Union Accession Agreement would practically, if not technically, preclude Ukraine’s membership of the Eurasian Economic Union — all these are not simply past bones of contention. For the Kremlin leadership they demonstrate a pattern of wilful deception that explains its impractical demands for “iron-clad” legal guarantees, not just verbal commitments. Western attempts to argue these cases, to challenge Moscow’s understandings of them or to consider them historical incidents of no current bearing, are thus regarded as gaslighting, equivalent to the unfaithful ex-spouse waving away past affairs as “ancient history” and seeking to limit any negotiations to the issues that suit them. Tellingly, for example, Ryabkov complained that the U.S. wanted to restore the work of the Russia-NATO Council, suspended since 2019, but “on their own terms, to an agenda that suits them, with an emphasis on so-called “Russian aggression” in Ukraine. To him, the attempt to define the parameters of any discussion was in itself an aggression. On one level, these may seem trivial analogies to draw, but the hope is that they convey the gulf between not just what each side is saying, but how they feel about the dispute. That is not to say there is no room for hope. The U.S. side seems to have avoided the temptation to respond to a recitation of Russian complaints in kind, but made an effort to talk them through. It also did not make any continuation of the discussions tightly dependent on immediate demands about a scaling down of the forces on the Ukrainian border or the like. Instead, it seems willing to give the conversation time — which is crucial to get through the opening bluster and at the very least let the Russians feel they are being heard. It’s less clear how far Moscow is willing to let the talks run if it doesn’t get the sense that there is any room for concrete progress on the one issue it seems to think is more important than all the rest: Ukraine, both in terms of NATO membership and also the potential for it to be used, even while not a member, as a base for Western military assets. The kinds of proposals Sherman has been able to put on the table so far — such as the deployment of missile defence systems in Europe and limits on military exercises — do not in any way add up to anything that Putin could consider a victory. Although we should not overstate the degree to which Putin is committed to the point that his choice is simply between “win or war,” an authoritarian regime has more scope to spin concessions as statesmanship. While the Russian people are not clamouring for conflict, he must see this as a crucial moment in his consistent efforts to redefine a European security order he feels is unfairly tilted against Russia. Ryabkov has made it clear that Russia wants NATO openly to repudiate its membership pledge to Ukraine and Georgia at its next summit, in Madrid. As that is not until June, it means there may be time yet for talk. Admittedly, at present, it is hard to see how any amount of discussion could bridge the gap between Russia and the West. The virtue of dialogue, though, is that new ideas and shared understandings can sometimes come from the back-and-forth. And with a reported 100,000-plus Russian troops on or near the Ukrainian border, and a system that has spent seven years doing everything it can to sanctions-proof itself to the point where it may credibly believe it can shrug off the “unprecedented sanctions” the West has threatened, dialogue is also better than the alternative.",1,1230,83.91,25.99,38.45,9.92,32.37,25.93,86.1,68.46,54.96,8.86,2.6,0.16,0.33,0.08,0.81,1.06,6.26,16.99,9.67,0.73,16.26,7.56,4.88,6.18,1.95,14.72,5.93,2.93,5.61,1.38,1.38,2.93,16.42,1.14,15.2,3.25,1.79,1.71,3.98,1.22,5.04,0,4.23,1.54,2.6,1.3,0.41,0.81,0.16,0.41,0.08,0,10.41,6.5,0.24,0.16,1.46,0.73,2.76,4.15,0.16,0,0,0.98,2.85,1.87,0.89,0.08,2.2,0.16,0.41,1.3,0.33,0.08,0.41,0.08,0,0,0.08,0,0,0,0,0.33,0.57,0.49,0,0,0,0.08,0.89,0,4.15,8.86,0.16,0.73,6.83,0.24,0.16,0.89,3.01,2.52,6.67,1.71,0,0,0,0,0,14.88,3.58,6.34,0.08,0,1.06,3.82

S . ",English,Russia,"The United States’ plans to levy sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin would be an “extreme” step that would signify a complete breakdown in ties between the two countries, the Kremlin said Thursday. U.S. senators, with support from the White House, unveiled a package of hard-hitting sanctions Wednesday evening intended to “devastate” the Russian economy should Moscow invade Ukraine. Among the measures would be personal sanctions against Putin, as well as several other top officials including Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. Sanctioning a head of state and other leading officials would be a rare move, as the U.S. has previously restricted its sanctions packages to lower-level officials. “Introducing sanctions against the head of the government or the head of Russia is an extreme measure which is comparable to a breakdown in relations,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in a briefing, according to the state-run TASS news agency. “What is Russia ready to do? Russia is always ready and will always do what is in the best interests of our country,” he added. Under the draft legislation, the U.S. government would also be required to investigate and publish a report into the personal wealth and assets of Putin, his family members and any other people the U.S. believes to hold assets on his behalf. Due to the U.S.’ leading role in the world economy, personal sanctions effectively prohibit individuals from traveling to or from accessing property and bank accounts held in most Western countries. Talks between Moscow, Washington and NATO in Europe this week have so far failed to move the sides closer to a resolution of what Moscow has called “large and fundamental differences.” Moscow wants legal guarantees that NATO will never admit Ukraine as a member and has called for troop deployments across the alliance to be rolled back to 1997 positions, before the bloc expanded into eastern Europe. The U.S. has branded the proposals a “non-starter,” and high-level talks in Geneva and Brussels this week have not managed to bring the sides closer together. Peskov on Thursday rejected NATO’s calls for Russia to de-escalate the situation by pulling back the estimated 100,000 troops that have been deployed close to the Ukrainian border. “It’s hardly possible that NATO can dictate to Russia where it should move troops on its own territory,” he said.",1,389,94.35,50.78,26.46,23.48,27.79,29.56,84.32,58.1,45.5,4.88,1.29,0,0.26,0,1.03,0,3.6,14.65,10.03,0.77,15.17,7.97,2.06,5.4,0.51,13.37,6.68,2.06,9,2.06,1.54,5.91,9.77,0.77,9,1.03,0.26,2.31,1.54,0.26,3.08,0,2.31,1.29,1.03,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.03,4.88,0.77,0,0.51,0,2.57,5.14,0,0,0,1.29,9.25,8.48,0.77,0,3.34,0,0.26,1.8,1.8,0,0.51,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.26,0.26,0,0,0.26,0,0,0,0.26,3.34,10.8,0.26,2.06,8.23,0.26,0,0,3.6,2.83,3.86,1.8,0,0,0,0,0,16.97,6.43,4.11,0.26,0,1.03,5.14

The United States and Russia had set firm lines ahead of the high-stakes security talks on Ukraine, with Washington warning of the risk of confrontation and Moscow ruling out concessions. A full day of talks was to follow Monday. Kazakhstan unrest Russia has evacuated nearly 1,500 of its nationals from Kazakhstan, said Moscow's Defense Ministry, which leads a regional military alliance that has been deployed to quell anti-government protests in the ex-Soviet Central Asian republic. Kazakhstan’s interior ministry said almost 8,000 people have been detained following a week of unrest. Its information ministry initially reported — before retracting its statement — that 164 people had died across the country during the violence. Trading barbs The U.S. and Russia traded barbs over the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization’s (CSTO) deployment to Kazakhstan, whose “peacekeeping” mission authorities expect will wrap up in one week. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said “one lesson of recent history is that once Russians are in your house, it’s sometimes very difficult to get them to leave.” Russia’s Foreign Ministry hit back with references to past U.S. invasions of other countries, saying “when Americans are in your house, it can be difficult to stay alive, not being robbed or raped.” ‘Gateway to Hell’ Turkmenistan's strongman leader has ordered experts to find a way to finally extinguish a massive five-decade old fire in a giant natural gas crater in the Central Asian country, dubbed the ""Gateway to Hell."" Citing environmental and economic concerns, President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov appeared on state television Saturday telling officials to put out the flames at the Darvaza gas crater in the middle of the vast Karakum desert. Orthodox Christmas Orthodox Christians observed Christmas on Friday, Jan. 7, with Patriarch Kirill leading the Russian Orthodox Church’s main midnight service at Christ the Savior Cathedral in Moscow.

A senior Russian diplomat hinted that it might as well as he sang the praises of Kanye West, known simply as Ye, and the influential Russian rapper Oxxxymiron. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov divulged his musical tastes at the end of a week of security talks with the United States, NATO and Europe’s top security body OSCE that ultimately fell short of resolving deep-rooted geopolitical tensions. “If Oxxxymiron’s rap could be layered on Mr. West’s music, that would probably be good,” Ryabkov said in an interview with the Russian-language international broadcaster RTVI on Thursday. “Oxxxymiron’s lyrics are amazing in their depth, in my view they’re better listened to and studied without the musical background,” he elaborated. “And Mr. Ye — he was always experimenting with music,” the Russian diplomat added. “Even now, there’s harmony in his compositions, if you remove some aspects of modern processing… If you listen to Mr. West abstractly, there are some things you can play on the balalaika, the piano and the harp.” One other unexpected bit of news from this Ryabkov interview: turns out he is a huge fan of Lady Gaga, Russian rapper @norimyxxxo, and Kanye West, who he refers to as “Mister Ye” in a detailed discussion of his work pic.twitter.com/p8Ex8G8E9F TikTok users immediately took up the challenge and created a mashup of Oxxxymiron’s lyrics and Ye’s music. In the RTVI interview, Ryabkov also revealed that his favorite artist was Lady Gaga. “I think she is unique in every way — as a composer, as a singer, and as an actress,” he gushed. Ryabkov’s unexpected appreciation for popular music follows the footsteps of former Kremlin aide Vladislav Surkov, who has openly shared his affinity for the poetry of the late rapper Tupac. But the pop culture digression did not distract from the bleak reality that Russia and the West remained at odds over European security. Following three sessions with the U.S., NATO and the OSCE in three European capitals, Ryabkov told RTVI he sees no reason to “gather again and start the same discussions.” He did not rule out Moscow sending troops to Cuba and Venezuela in response to what the Kremlin perceives as the U.S. threatening its security with troops and missiles near Russian borders. The United States and NATO rejected Moscow’s demands to withdraw their troops from Eastern Europe and for ex-Soviet Ukraine and Georgia never to be admitted into the U.S.-led military alliance. The West has warned that an estimated 100,000 Russian troops and equipment amassed at the border with Ukraine signaled an “imminent” invasion, which the Kremlin denies.",1,437,86.8,80.26,13.84,32.97,27.31,26.77,81.46,59.5,46.68,8.92,6.18,0.46,0,1.37,3.2,0.69,2.75,14.65,9.15,1.14,13.96,4.58,3.43,7.09,0.92,10.53,5.26,2.75,4.58,1.37,1.14,2.06,9.15,0.92,8.24,2.06,0.92,0.69,1.37,0.46,2.75,0,3.66,2.29,1.37,0.69,0.69,0,0,0,0,0,15.1,6.18,0.69,1.37,0.46,0,2.97,10.07,0,0,0.92,3.89,5.49,3.43,2.06,0,4.58,2.75,0,1.83,0,0,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.23,0,0,0,0.69,0.46,0,0,0,1.37,0.23,2.06,11.67,0.69,0.23,7.32,0.69,2.29,0.23,3.2,4.58,3.89,0.69,0.46,0.46,0,0,0,19.68,6.18,5.49,0.23,0,2.29,5.49

Almaty, the country's former capital, had been nearly completely offline since Wednesday, but local and foreign websites were accessible again Monday morning, following the worst unrest in the ex-Soviet republic's independent history. The Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), a Moscow-led regional military bloc that has dispatched peacekeeping troops to the country, was set to hold an online summit on the crisis Monday, with the Kremlin confirming Russian President Vladimir Putin's attendance. AFP correspondents saw public transport on the streets of Almaty for the first time since protests descended into violence earlier this week, leaving strategic government buildings burned and gutted and businesses counting the costs of a looting spree. Lyudmila, a pensioner who was waiting for a bus in the city center and gave only her first name, said she was alerted to the internet's reappearance by a messenger call from relatives in Ukraine. ""I had no idea that we were back online again,"" she said. She told AFP that during clashes on Wednesday night, injured soldiers had been dragged into the courtyard of the apartment building where she lived for emergency treatment. Kazakhstan has framed the violence in Almaty as an attack by ""terrorist groups"" and expressed displeasure at foreign media coverage of the events, which began with protests over a fuel price hike in the west of the country on Jan. 2. On Monday the government said foreign media reports had created ""the false impression that the Kazakhstan government has been targeting peaceful protestors."" ""Our security forces have been engaging with violent mobs who were committing brazen acts of terror,"" the foreign ministry said in the statement. But the authoritarian government has also struggled to firm up its own narrative. On Sunday evening the information ministry retracted a statement that had appeared in an officially run Telegram channel earlier that said more than 164 people had died in the unrest. Two private websites that had reported the news said the information ministry had told them the statement was the result of a ""technical mistake."" Officials previously said 26 ""armed criminals"" had been killed and that 16 security officers had died. In total, 5,800 people have been detained for questioning, the presidency said in a statement on Sunday. Nur-Sultan, the city that replaced Almaty as capital in 1997 and which was renamed in honor of 81-year-old founding president Nursultan Nazarbayev in 2019, saw comparatively little unrest. The crisis comes with tensions between Moscow and the West at post-Cold War highs over fears of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, with talks between Russia and the U.S. to take place in Geneva on Monday after a working dinner on Sunday evening. Russia has ruled out any concessions at the talks. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has thanked the Moscow-led CSTO for answering his request for help and sending a detachment of 2,500 troops to the country. Tokayev says the deployment will be temporary, but U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned on Friday that ""once Russians are in your house, it's sometimes very difficult to get them to leave."" While the precise contours of the political crisis that engulfed Kazakhstan are unclear, it is evident that the ruling elite has been roiled. On Saturday, authorities announced the arrest on treason charges of Karim Masimov, a high-profile Nazarbayev ally who was dismissed from his post as security committee chief at the height of the unrest. Nazarbayev, who was widely regarded as holding the strings in the oil-rich Central Asian country despite stepping down from the presidency in 2019, has not spoken in public since the crisis began. Nazarbayev's press secretary said on Twitter Saturday that Nazarbayev was in ""direct contact"" with Tokayev and called on Kazakhs to ""rally around"" the president.

Prices for gas have soared this winter in Europe, with wholesale prices standing five times higher than last year in a number of countries. Moscow has been blamed for withholding shipments to Europe during a cold snap last year and keeping gas storage facilities low. The Kremlin and Gazprom, Russia’s monopoly gas exporter, have denied any wrongdoing, and said Europe should have struck multi-year contracts if it wanted to secure stable energy supplies, rather than relying on short-term market prices. Fatih Birol, director of the influential IEA, said Wednesday that Russia could boost gas supplies by at least a third but is choosing not to. “There are strong elements of tightness in the European gas market due to Russia’s behavior,” Bloomberg quoted Birol as saying. “The current storage deficit in the European Union is largely due to Gazprom.” It calculated Russian supplies to Europe were down 25% from 2020 levels in the fourth quarter of 2021, and were 22% below pre-pandemic levels. The IEA is an organization which represents 30 major economies, most European, and advises them on global energy policies. Russia is not a member. With gas prices at record highs across the continent, the IEA pointed out that Gazprom would stand to benefit from increasing supplies to Europe and selling more on the so-called spot market, but is instead refusing to do so. The criticism renews a bitter war of words between Russia, the EU and U.S. over whether Russia is abusing its role as Europe’s main energy supplier to secure final approval for its controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline. That initiative, led by Russia’s Gazprom, has been thrown into new uncertainty in recent days, with U.S. officials saying it would work to block the pipeline from ever going live if Russia invades Ukraine. Sweden became the latest individual country to criticize Russia’s gas policies Wednesday. The Scandinavian country’s energy minister set aside more than $600 million in government funds to help households deal with rising energy costs and said Russia was partly to blame for the high prices and economic hardship.",1,371,95.37,26.87,25.87,5.02,24.73,25.88,75.47,54.72,41.24,3.23,0.27,0,0,0,0,0.27,2.96,10.78,6.74,2.96,16.44,5.93,1.89,5.93,0.54,10.24,6.2,7.01,4.58,0.54,0.54,3.5,7.55,0.27,7.01,0.27,0.27,1.35,1.62,0,3.23,0,5.12,1.62,3.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.55,5.66,0.54,0,1.89,1.08,2.43,1.35,0.27,0,0,0,2.16,1.35,0.81,0,7.28,0,0.27,3.23,3.77,0,0.27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.27,0.27,0,0.27,0,0,0.27,0.81,0,2.96,8.89,0.54,0.81,6.74,0,0,0.81,4.85,3.77,3.23,0.27,0,0,0,0,0,14.82,5.12,4.58,0,0,1.62,3.5

Putin's remarks came days after 2,500 Russian, Belarusian, Armenian, Tajik and Kyrgyz troops were deployed across Kazakh cities to defend key state facilities as part of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) alliance. “We will not allow the realization of so-called color revolution scenarios,” Putin said during Monday's videoconference of CSTO members, according to the state-run RIA Novosti news agency. He accused unidentified “outside forces” of interfering “in the internal affairs of our states,” echoing the Kazakh authorities’ latest claims of foreign links in the unrest. “They used well-organized and well-controlled militant groups… including those who had obviously been trained in terrorist camps abroad,” Putin said, calling Kazakhstan the target of “international terrorism.” Putin also stressed that the CSTO forces would only remain in Kazakhstan for a ""limited"" time period. Russian officials and pro-Kremlin media have blamed the West for trying to foment a “color revolution” in Kazakhstan — a similar reprise voiced during popular uprisings in ex-Soviet Georgia, Ukraine and Belarus in recent years. Speaking at the CSTO summit, Kazakhstan’s President Kassym Jomart-Tokayev called the week of violence “an attempted coup d’etat.” The Kremlin also criticized the role of social media in fueling the unprecedented protests in Kazakhstan. “Social networks obviously have both good and harmful elements. The task is to take measures to stop the harmful side,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday. “This is not new, it’s just once again been confirmed by the recent events in Kazakhstan.” Authorities in Kazakhstan shut down internet access across the country amid the nationwide protests last week, with access still limited in major cities for days after the unrest. Putin has been a longtime critic of social media’s potential for influencing young people and has recently taken more aggressive steps to limit the kind of content that can be shared online, slapping multimillion dollar fines on the likes of Google and Facebook, for instance, for refusing to remove content linked to Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration has dismissed claims that it was behind the unrest. Oil- and uranium-producing Kazakhstan has been left reeling in the wake of unprecedented unrest that erupted earlier this month in the midst of protests over a fuel price hike in the west of the country. Dozens have been killed in the unrest and the interior ministry said earlier Monday that nearly 8,000 people had been detained in operations executed by several branches of the security services.

Alongside Russia, CSTO member states Armenia, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan sent troop contingents to Kazakhstan, an important regional power with vast energy resources and a founding member of the Eurasian Economic Union, a Russia-led regional trade bloc. Tokayev said that intervention was necessary to counter a “terrorist threat” after protests against a fuel price hike spread nationwide, with demonstrators in Kazakhstan’s commercial capital Almaty seizing weapons, setting government buildings alight and shutting down the country’s main international airport. Kazakh media have reported that at least twelve police officers have been killed during the unrest, with “dozens” more fatalities reported. On Thursday morning, footage circulated on social media showed Kazakh army units exchanging gunfire with armed opponents as they attempted to retake Almaty. For many Russian observers, the sudden explosion of unrest in a country otherwise known for political stability, underlines a sense that intervention — which until only hours before Tokayev’s plea for help had been sworn off by the Kremlin — was unavoidable. “I don’t think Russia had any choice but to intervene,” said RIAC’s Kortunov, who pointed to a 2020 revolution in Kazakhstan’s Central Asian neighbor Kyrgyzstan, and last year’s Taliban takeover in Afghanistan. “Given how violent the unrest was and how unstable the region is, this seems like it was the only option,'' he added. “But it’s important that this is a short, time-limited operation and that we don’t get sucked in. The crisis in Kazakhstan comes at an awkward time for Russia. With tensions with the West on the rise amid a months-long military buildup on the Ukrainian border and fears of war, Russian has moved westward many of the units it usually deploys in Siberia and the Urals, along its frontier with Kazakhstan. As reports of unrest spread across Kazakhstan on Wednesday, parts of the pro-Kremlin media labeled the events a “Maidan”, referring to the 2014 revolution in Ukraine that touched off that country’s break with Russia, and accused the West of contriving the disturbances ahead of high-stakes U.S.-Russia talks this month. Tokayev likewise claimed that his country was under “external attack” from “bands of terrorists.” However, with Russia’s armed forces heavily engaged along the Ukrainian border, and much of its diplomatic capacity given over to ongoing talks with the U.S. on security guarantees, the Kazakhstan crisis represents an unwelcome turn of events for Moscow. “The Kremlin needs to divide [its] attention … and manage strategic instability on two fronts,” Alexander Baunov, a Russian foreign policy analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Center think tank, wrote on Twitter. For some experts, the biggest potential risk is Russia’s getting sucked into Kazakhstan’s domestic disputes. Though Kazakhstan has a large Russian majority, and the country’s north has sometimes been the object of irredentist dreams, Russo-Kazakh relations have been generally friendly since the end of the U.S.S.R. With Russia now assuming a leading role in underwriting Kazakhstan’s government, RIAC’s Kortunov fears an outpouring of Kazakh nationalism and disruption of the country’s fragile internal ethnic balance. Previous Russian interventions in post-Soviet countries have seen friendly states take sharp anti-Russian turns, Kortunov noted. “There’s a real chance that we could see the rise of anti-Russian sentiment in Kazakhstan, along the lines of Ukraine or Georgia,” he said. The crisis in Kazakhstan is also likely to impinge on Russia’s domestic politics. Though both countries have been largely stable under long-standing authoritarian regimes, widespread economic frustrations and inequality have eaten away at both governments’ popular standing. In Russia, as in Kazakhstan, unpopular socio-economic reforms including a 2018 pension age increase, and wage stagnation have driven down the president’s once sky-high approval rating. A recent Levada Center poll showed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s electoral rating — the number of Russians ready to vote for his re-election — at 32%, a record low. “Putin generally does believe in his own popularity,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of R.Politik, a political consultancy firm. “But the events in Kazakhstan could make him doubt how sustainable that popularity really is.” For some opposition-minded Russians, recalling how the outbreak of unrest in Belarus in summer 2020 presaged an unprecedented crackdown at home, events in Kazakhstan bodes ill for Russian liberties. “We’ll be the ones to pay for the Kazakhs’ freedom,” wrote Kirill Martynov, deputy editor of Russia’s independent Novaya Gazeta newspaper, on Twitter, predicting a crackdown by Russian security services fearing copycat protests across the border. For others, the protests in Kazakhstan — which were in large part directed against Nursultan Nazarbayev, the country’s founding president who resigned in 2019 but still retains extensive behind-the-scenes powers — could influence Vladimir Putin’s choice on whether to stay in office or not. After Nazarbayev — who is personally close to Putin — departed from the presidency to head his country’s powerful Security Council, some observers suggested that the Russian president might eventually follow the Kazakh model, by handing over day-to-day responsibilities to a hand-picked successor while retaining ultimate control. However, the outpouring of rage against the man who has led Kazakhstan since it was part of the Soviet Union, including scenes of a Nazarbayev statue in the city of Taldykorgan being felled by protesters, may lead Putin to conclude that loosening his grip on power is dangerous. Tokayev’s Wednesday announcement that he was taking over the country’s Security Council, displacing his erstwhile patron, only underlines the risks of any handover of power. “Kazakh events make [the] Kazakhstan power transit scenario virtually impossible for Russia,” wrote Carnegie’s Baunov. “Now Putin will hardly be inclined to leave his position to a successor.”",1,1018,96.89,44.12,35.09,4.7,27.51,34.68,78.09,54.32,41.94,4.81,2.06,0.2,0.29,0,1.08,0.1,2.75,13.06,8.74,1.08,16.6,5.21,2.65,4.32,0.29,10.71,5.6,3.54,6.88,1.67,0.79,4.91,8.84,0.2,8.64,1.67,1.77,0.49,2.06,0.39,2.95,0.1,3.24,0.59,2.55,0.88,0.2,0.59,0.29,0.29,0,0,8.15,3.73,0.59,0.2,1.08,0.1,1.87,3.83,0,0,0,1.18,8.25,3.73,4.32,0.2,3.14,0.1,0.29,1.87,0.98,0.1,0.49,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1,0.2,0.49,0,0.39,0,0,0,0,1.28,0,2.55,9.82,0.1,1.47,7.47,0.39,0.1,0.49,3.83,4.22,2.95,1.18,0.2,0.2,0,0,0,20.83,4.52,6.58,0,0,3.44,6.29

The energy-rich nation of 19 million people has been rocked by a week of upheaval with nearly 6,000 — including a number of foreigners — detained over the unrest. At least 164 people were killed in the riots, including 103 in the largest city Almaty, which saw some of the fiercest clashes between protesters and police. The new figures mark a drastic increase in the death toll, as officials previously said 26 ""armed criminals"" had been killed and 16 security officers had died. In total, 5,800 people have been detained for questioning, the presidency said in a statement on Sunday after President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev held a crisis meeting. The figures included ""a substantial number of foreign nationals"", it said without elaborating. ""The situation has stabilised in all regions of the country,"" even if security forces were continuing ""cleanup"" operations, the statement added.  Fuel price rises sparked the unrest that broke out a week ago in western provincial areas but quickly spread to large cities, including the economic hub Almaty, where riots erupted and police opened fire using live rounds. The interior ministry, quoted Sunday by local media, put property damage at around 175 million euros ($199 million). More than 100 businesses and banks were attacked and looted and more than 400 vehicles destroyed, the ministry reportedly said. A relative calm appeared to have returned to Almaty, with police sometimes firing shots into the air to stop people approaching the city's central square, an AFP correspondent said. Supermarkets were reopening on Sunday, media reported, amid fears of food shortages. Kazakhstan said Saturday its former security chief had been arrested for suspected treason, as Russia hit back at U.S. criticism of its deployment of troops to the crisis-hit country. News of the detention of Karim Masimov, a former prime minister and longtime ally of Kazakhstan's ex-leader Nursultan Nazarbayev, came amid speculation of a power struggle in the ex-Soviet nation. The domestic intelligence agency, the National Security Committee (KNB), announced Masimov had been detained on Thursday on suspicion of high treason. President Tokayev sacked Masimov after protests turned into widespread violence, with government buildings in Almaty stormed and set ablaze. Masimov, 56, was fired at the height of the unrest on Wednesday, when Tokayev also took over from Nazarbayev as head of the powerful security council. Nazarbayev's spokesman Aidos Ukibay on Sunday again denied rumours the ex-president had left the country and said he supported the president. Ukibay added that Nazarbayev voluntarily ceded control of the security council.  In a hardline address to the nation on Friday, Tokayev said 20,000 ""armed bandits"" had attacked Almaty and authorised his forces to shoot to kill without warning. Much of the public anger appeared directed at Nazarbayev, who is 81 and had ruled Kazakhstan since 1989 before handing over power. Many protesters shouted ""old man out!"" in reference to Nazarbayev, and a statue of him was torn down in the southern city of Taldykorgan. Critics accuse him and his family of staying in control behind the scenes and accumulating vast wealth at the expense of ordinary citizens. The full picture of the chaos has often been unclear, with widespread disruptions to communications including days-long internet shutdowns. Flights into the country have been repeatedly cancelled and Almaty's airport will remain closed ""until the situation is stabilised"", authorities said Sunday. Tokayev has thanked the Moscow-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) for sending troops to help deal with the unrest. The CSTO has been dispatching several thousand troops to Kazakhstan, including Russian paratroopers, who have been securing strategic sites. Tokayev says the deployment will be temporary, but U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned on Friday that Kazakhstan may have trouble getting them out. ""I think one lesson in recent history is that once Russians are in your house, it's sometimes very difficult to get them to leave,"" Blinken told reporters.

Kiev slammed as “political” this week’s contract that will supply 4.5 billion cubic meters of Russian natural gas to Hungary every year until 2036 through non-Ukrainian transit routes. “Gazprom stopped gas transit through Ukraine to Hungary,” Yuri Vitrenko, the CEO of Ukraine’s pipeline operator Naftogaz, wrote on Facebook. Vitrenko accused Gazprom of using gas exports as a “weapon” and said the Hungary deal “clearly demonstrates” its intent after Russia launches another pipeline that bypasses Ukraine to deliver gas to Germany, Nord Stream 2. “A joint statement from the United States and Germany indicates that in case of the Kremlin using gas as a weapon, there should be an appropriate reaction,” he said, referring to a U.S.-German deal in July that would threaten Russia with sanctions and extend gas transit through Ukraine. “We are now waiting for sanctions imposed on a 100% subsidiary of Gazprom, the Nord Stream 2 operator,” the Naftogaz CEO said. Gazprom and the Kremlin have dismissed Ukraine’s concerns about the loss of its role as a transit provider. Russia and Gazprom have also maintained that the $12-billion Nord Stream 2 would increase the stability of Russian gas supplies to Europe. Ukraine’s accusations come amid calls by European parliamentarians to investigate possible market manipulation by Gazprom amid record-high gas prices in Europe. The EU lawmakers claim that the company refuses to export gas to exert pressure on Europe as Nord Stream 2 awaits certification by German regulators after its recent completion. The Kremlin says Russia is fulfilling its gas export obligations under existing contracts and denies that it is attempting to speed up the Nord Stream 2 approval process through natural gas export manipulation. Ukraine makes around $3 billion a year by transiting Russian gas to Europe — a commercial relationship which has persisted despite the ongoing war between Russian-backed separatists in the Donbass and Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.",1,344,97.33,45.22,6.76,4.42,28.67,35.17,68.02,46.51,38.08,5.52,0.58,0,0.29,0,0.29,0,4.94,12.5,7.56,3.78,17.15,3.2,1.74,5.23,0,7.27,2.62,2.62,6.69,0.58,0.87,5.23,6.1,0.29,5.81,0.29,2.03,1.16,0.29,0.29,1.16,0,2.62,0.29,2.33,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.1,4.07,0,0,1.16,0.58,1.74,1.74,0,0,0,0.29,5.23,3.2,2.03,0,4.94,0,0,3.49,1.16,0.29,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.29,0.29,0,0.58,0,0,0.87,0,2.33,6.1,0.29,0.87,5.23,0,0,0,3.78,1.74,2.91,0.58,0,0,0,0,0,14.83,4.36,2.62,0,0,2.03,5.81

Viktor Bryukhanov was the plant’s first and only director during its years of operation, having also managed the construction of the Chernobyl nuclear station from 1970 to 1977. Bryukhanov was fired within weeks of the April 1986 explosion. Authorities in Soviet Ukraine sentenced him to 10 years in prison on charges of safety violations. He was released after he had served half of his jail term. The Chernobyl nuclear power station’s press service announced Bryukhanov’s passing on its Facebook page Wednesday. It did not indicate a cause of death. “The plant team and administration express their deepest condolences to the family and friends of the deceased,” it said. Bryukhanov was famously portrayed by Con O’Neill in HBO’s critically acclaimed 2019 “Chernobyl” miniseries, which documented the aftermath of the nuclear accident and the Soviet-era mismanagement of the response efforts.

Secret documents declassified by Ukraine earlier this year showed Bryukhanov’s first post-disaster report assured the authorities that radiation levels following the meltdown were “under control.” Born in Soviet Uzbekistan on Dec. 1, 1935, Bryukhanov relocated to Ukraine, also part of the U.S.S.R., in 1966 after graduating with an electrical engineering degree from the Tashkent Polytechnic Institute and working at the country’s thermal power plant.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has offered to meet Putin to discuss the return of annexed Crimea and resolve the seven-year conflict with pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine. But the Kremlin has rebuffed Zelenskiy’s request, refusing to negotiate the status of Crimea and saying that two sides’ agendas for a face-to-face meeting do not align. Writing in the Kommersant business daily, Medvedev criticized Zelenskiy as “weak,” “ignorant” and “unreliable” — without referring to him by name — and attacked the country’s “complete dependence” on the United States. “How can you negotiate and strike deals with him?” wrote Medvedev, who was demoted last year from the post of prime minister to the newly created position of deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council. “It’s pointless for us to deal with vassals.” Medvedev also accused the Ukrainian leader of working with neo-Nazi and fascist groups, and made references to Zelenskiy’s Jewish roots. Medvedev slammed the Ukrainian president for “serving the most rabid nationalist forces in Ukraine” and warned that “at some point, when the political situation changes, they’ll sew a yellow star on your back.” Russia has for years criticized what it sees as a powerful fascist element behind various anti-Russia policies and movements in Ukraine. “Appeasing these attitudes clearly disgusts him, since his and his family’s whole history stands against such vileness,” Medvedev said. “But, alas, he has to. Otherwise, they’ll smear his brains against the wall. So he is forced to preach their ideology.” The former prime minister recommended Moscow wait for “sane” figures to replace Zelenskiy and other Ukrainian leaders before the Kremlin considers opening negotiations. “Russia knows how to wait. We are patient people,” Medvedev wrote. The Kremlin said later Monday that Medvedev’s article “runs in unison” with Russia’s view of the current Ukrainian government.",1,327,92.83,70.26,24.81,2.23,18.17,37.92,78.29,53.82,41.9,7.03,4.89,0,0.61,0.61,2.45,0.92,2.14,11.93,7.34,0.61,15.9,3.98,2.45,6.42,0.61,10.4,5.5,2.14,8.26,0.92,0.61,6.73,9.17,0,9.17,1.83,2.45,0.61,0,0.31,4.28,0,4.59,0.92,3.67,0.31,0,0.31,0,0,0,0,18.04,8.87,0.31,0.31,1.83,0.61,4.89,8.87,0.31,0,0,2.45,6.73,4.59,2.14,0,6.12,0,0,5.5,0.31,0.61,0.92,0.61,0,0,0.31,0,0,0,0,0.61,0,0,0,0.31,0,0,0.92,0.31,1.83,7.03,0.31,1.22,4.89,0.92,0,0,5.2,3.98,3.67,1.22,0,0,0,0,0,24.16,5.2,4.28,0.31,0,3.67,10.7

Moscow said President Vladimir Putin, his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel instructed the ministers to work toward a meeting during a joint telephone call Monday. According to the Kremlin, it would take place within the framework of the ""Normandy Four"" — which usually brings together officials from Moscow and Kiev under the mediation of Paris and Berlin. The Kremlin did not say in its statement if Ukraine would take part in the meeting. However France's presidency said that it should involve Ukraine. The presidency also said in a statement that Macron and Merkel held a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy before speaking to Putin. Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert also confirmed the plans for the meeting, for which a date has not yet been set. The Kremlin said the leaders had instructed their foreign ministers to ""intensify their contacts and work"" after a ""difficult"" situation in eastern Ukraine. The leaders also agreed to consider organizing a summit, the Russian and German statements said. During the phone call, Putin accused the Kiev authorities of ""stubbornly evading"" fulfilling agreements reached at peace talks. France and Germany have been mediators in the conflict between Kiev and pro-Moscow separatists since 2015 in the so-called Normandy format and have been overseeing a fragile ceasefire. Angela Merkel visited both Moscow and Kiev in August. Afterward, she then expressed her hope that peace talks on the conflict between Kiev and pro-Russia separatists would continue after she left power. The Ukrainian army is locked in a simmering conflict with breakaway fighters in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions that erupted after Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014. The conflict has claimed more than 13,000 lives. Ukraine and its Western allies accuse Russia of sending troops and arms to support the separatists, which Moscow denies. The European Union on Monday imposed sanctions on eight more officials accused of targeting opponents of Russia's seizure of Crimea, ahead of a visit to Kiev by the bloc's top officials.

Clashes have regularly broken out in the east in recent weeks, undermining a ceasefire brokered last year that had raised hopes of ending a conflict that erupted in 2014 after Russia annexed Crimea. The Ukrainian army said that one serviceman was killed on Saturday when separatist fighters opened fire with small arms, while another soldier ""received a gunshot bullet wound incompatible with life"" on Monday. The fresh clashes come as Russia has massed thousands of its soldiers on its border with Ukraine, with the White House last week saying the number of Russian troops at the border was now greater than at any time since 2014. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's spokeswoman told AFP on Monday that Russia now has 41,000 troops on Ukraine's eastern border and 42,000 soldiers on the Crimean peninsula. Spokeswoman Yulia Mendel also said that Zelenskiy had sent a query to the Kremlin in late March requesting talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin over the escalating conflict, but was yet to receive an answer. ""We hope that President Vladimir Putin does not refuse dialogue,"" Mendel told AFP. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, however, denied that Moscow had received a request for talks. ""I am not aware of any such enquiries in recent days,"" he told reporters on Monday. The Kremlin, which has not denied the troop movements, has said it is not moving towards war with Ukraine, but also that it ""will not remain indifferent"" to the fate of Russian speakers in the east. The conflict, which has claimed more than 13,000 lives, has seen 28 Ukrainian soldiers killed since the start of the year compared to 50 in all of 2020.

Witnesses filmed around 30 unknown individuals barging into the office of Memorial, a group which documents Soviet-era repressions and victims of Josef Stalin’s Great Terror, shouting “fascists,” “shame” and telling viewers to leave because “the screening is over.” When police later appeared, they handcuffed the entrance doors to Memorial’s office and locked its staff and attendees inside for several hours, the group’s lawyer said. They also dismantled the office’s fire alarm system and took away a video recording device, the independent Novaya Gazeta paper reported. The film being shown was Polish director Agnieszka Holland’s “Mr. Jones,” released in 2019. It tells the story of Welsh journalist Gareth Jones, one of the first Western journalists to report on the 1932-33 Ukrainian famine, known as the Holodomor. “Of course [the attack] was against Memorial and not the film,” Memorial spokeswoman Natalia Petrova told Reuters. “The film was just a pretext,” she added. Russian authorities have for years attempted to thwart Memorial’s work, activists say, including through fines and searches of their premises across the country. Several Memorial activists have been imprisoned on what the group says are politically motivated charges, including Oyub Titiev, head of Memorial’s office in Chechnya and Yury Dmitriyev, head of its Karelian branch. Scholars estimate between 4-7.5 million people were killed in the Holodomor, a man-made disaster that Kiev and a handful of other countries have declared a genocide. Moscow has rejected those assertions and interpretation of the causes of the famine has remained a wedge between the two countries. The screening of “Mr. Jones” comes at a sensitive time for relations between Russia and Ukraine, amid the protracted war between Ukrainian government forces and pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine. Memorial lawyer Natalia Morozova accused police of allowing most of the men who had stormed the group's offices to leave without being questioned. They “didn’t show much zeal to detain even those who they managed to catch,” Morozova told the RBC news website. She added that police conducted lengthy interrogations of viewers and Memorial staff, forcing them to stay inside and provide detailed written statements. Lawyers were only allowed inside around midnight — four hours after the disruption — with staff and police on site until at least 1 a.m. Moscow time. Russian authorities labeled Memorial a foreign agent in 2014. The designation imposes onerous financial auditing requirements on the group and forces it to add public disclaimers declaring itself a “foreign agent” to every one of its publications. The organization was founded in the final years of the Soviet Union, during a period of openness ushered in by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbochev.",1,482,98.24,66.85,20.02,4.26,22.95,32.57,80.91,52.28,43.57,4.77,2.07,0,0,0,0.41,1.24,2.7,15.15,10.58,3.11,16.6,3.73,2.07,4.77,0.41,8.09,4.15,4.56,7.26,0.21,0.83,6.43,5.81,0.21,5.6,0.83,1.66,0,0.62,0.41,1.87,0,2.9,0.41,2.49,0.41,0,0.41,0.21,0,0,0,13.28,6.64,0,0.41,1.45,0.83,3.32,6.85,0,0,0.62,0.83,3.32,1.24,1.87,0.21,6.43,1.04,0,4.77,0.62,0,3.11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.7,0.21,0,0.41,0.62,0,0,0,0,0,2.07,9.54,0.41,0.83,7.26,0.83,0.21,0.21,3.11,4.98,1.66,0,0,0,0,0,0,17.22,5.19,4.77,0,0,1.87,5.39

The latest step pushing the Baltic Sea pipeline to completion comes as Europe faces an energy crisis with natural gas reserves at a low level and energy prices surging. ""The gas-in procedure for the first string of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline has started,"" Nord Stream 2 AG said in a statement. ""This string will be gradually filled to build the required inventory and pressure as a prerequisite for the later technical tests,"" said the Switzerland-based company, which is owned by a subsidiary of Russian gas giant Gazprom. It said it would publish more information about ""further technical steps in due time."" Nord Stream 2 has for years divided European capitals and raised tensions between the bloc and Washington. The pipeline diverts supplies from an existing route through Ukraine and is expected to deprive Europe's ally of an estimated 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) annually in transit fees from Russia. Ukraine — in conflict with Russia since Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea — has warned Europe that Nord Stream 2 could be used by Moscow to exert pressure. The United States has reluctantly signed off on the project, but says it will sanction Moscow if the pipeline is used as a weapon. ""We continue to oppose this pipeline,"" U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said on Monday. ""We continue to believe it is a geopolitical project of the Russian Federation and we will continue to apply the law consistent with our periodic reviews which, of course, remain ongoing."" When Gazprom announced last month that construction was complete, Kiev vowed to continue lobbying against the project ""even after the gas is turned on."" Gas prices in Europe around the same time were skyrocketing in anticipation of higher winter demand and the International Energy Agency urged Russia open the taps. Moscow has said that it is waiting for Nord Stream 2 to come online before delivering more gas, but said the pipeline would help combat surging gas prices in Europe. Running from Russia's Baltic coast to northeastern Germany, the underwater, 1,200-kilometer (745-mile) pipeline follows the same route as Nord Stream 1, which was completed over a decade ago. Like its twin, Nord Stream 2 will be able to pipe 55 billion cubic meters of gas per year to Europe, increasing the continent's access to relatively cheap natural gas at a time of falling domestic production. Germany, Europe's top economy, imports around 40% of its gas from Russia, and Berlin believes the pipeline has a role to play in the country's transition away from coal and nuclear energy.",1,457,97.51,41.36,40.89,9.65,26.88,26.48,73.96,53.83,41.14,4.38,0.88,0,0.88,0,0,0,3.5,12.47,9.19,4.38,16.63,5.69,1.75,4.6,0,10.72,5.69,5.03,2.63,1.31,0.22,1.09,5.47,0,5.47,0.88,0.88,0.66,0.44,0.44,2.19,0,2.19,0.44,1.53,0.22,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.03,3.72,0.44,0,0.66,0,2.41,1.53,0,0.22,0,0.22,3.06,1.53,0.66,0.88,5.03,0.22,0,3.06,1.75,0,0.22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.44,0,0.22,0.22,0.88,0,0,0.66,0,2.41,8.53,0.22,2.19,6.78,0,0,0.22,5.47,4.6,3.72,1.31,0,0,0,0,0,14.44,4.38,3.94,0,0,1.31,4.81

""The decision to withdraw the accreditation of eight members of the Russian delegation to NATO was done based on intelligence because these are undeclared Russian intelligence officers,"" Stoltenberg said. ""We have seen an increase in Russian malign activities, at least in Europe and therefore we need to act."" The NATO chief said that the decision to kick out the Russian representatives was not ""linked to any particular event"" — but gave no more details over the move. NATO announced Wednesday it had decided to strip the ""undeclared Russian intelligence officers"" of official accreditation to the alliance and halve the size of the Russian delegation to 10. Stoltenberg reiterated that the ""relationship between NATO and Russia is at its lowest point since the end of the Cold War. And that's because of the Russian behavior."" Ties between the West and Moscow have slumped in recent years since the Kremlin's 2014 annexation of Crimea and over its involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Russia has long had an observer mission to NATO as part of a two-decade-old NATO-Russia Council meant to promote cooperation in common security areas, but it is not a member of the U.S.-led Alliance. The Kremlin said earlier Thursday that the expulsions showed NATO members have no desire to normalise relations with Moscow. ""There is an obvious contradiction in the statements of NATO representatives about the desire to normalise relations with our country and in real actions,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. The Russian mission has been downsized once before, when seven of its members were ejected after the 2018 poisoning by the Novichok nerve agent on a Russian former double agent, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter in Britain. Accreditation applications by another three Russian diplomats were denied. Meetings of a NATO-Russia council have not been held since 2019 against the backdrop of the heightened tensions. ""We are ready to engage in meaningful dialogue with with Russia, and we are ready also to convene a NATO-Russia Council meeting,"" Stoltenberg said. ""We have actually invited Russia for a long time. So far, Russia has not responded positively."" Sky News reported that NATO's decision came after information was revealed in April about fatal explosions at a Czech ammunition depot in 2014 that Prague says involved two Russian spies — identified as allegedly implicated in the Skripal poisoning.

Her legacy will live on long after she steps down from the leadership. While firmly embedded within the European Union, Germany has essentially become its sole, though by no means, absolute leader. It is a peaceful champion of a soft European version of liberalism. Vocal support for values does not, however, translate into interventionism. Nor does it prevent Germany from pursuing its business interests or waging a pragmatic foreign policy — within the limits of the EU/NATO framework. Merkel’s leadership was almost always steady and dependable, and her policies were largely predictable. True, neither Germany within the EU nor the EU within the U.S.-led system have achieved strategic autonomy on her watch, but that was hardly Merkel’s objective. Viewed from Moscow, Merkel’s legacy can be summarized as follows: reconfirmation of Germany’s Atlanticist orientation; achievement of a primus inter pares position within the European Union; and distancing from Russia, while keeping in touch with it. In 2005, Merkel succeeded Gerhard Schroeder, the Social Democratic leader who took over from Helmut Kohl as a result of the 1998 election. Under Schroeder, newly reunified Germany’s ambition to play a more autonomous role in world affairs reached its peak. In 2003, Berlin, Paris, and Moscow had even formed a new entente, as Russia’s then foreign minister Igor Ivanov called it, to oppose the U.S. invasion of Iraq and potentially act as a counterweight to Washington. The vision of a greater Europe from the Atlantic to the Pacific based on the marriage between the German/European industry and Russian resources was just about to take shape. Merkel, a former East German citizen, faced the need to be accepted by Germany’s largely Atlanticist political elite, as well as by Berlin’s principal allies in Washington. Mending strained ties with the United States became a priority for her, and she worked hard on it. Merkel succeeded, and in return, she got American support for Germany’s leading role in Europe, albeit within the general framework of U.S. global leadership. This did not mean Germany blindly following the United States at every turn: in 2008, Merkel refused to accept George W. Bush’s bid to include Ukraine and Georgia in NATO, and in 2010, Germany took no part in the NATO military operation in Libya, even abstaining at the relevant UN Security Council vote alongside China, India, and Russia. At the same time, Merkel did not allow the embarrassing public scandal over U.S. intelligence tapping her cell phone to get out of hand. During the Donald Trump years, Merkel — who did not get along too well with the forty-fifth U.S. president — rose to become the de facto temporary leader of the liberal West. That unanimous and apparently natural choice of the vast majority of European and American elites was recognition of the national prestige of both Merkel personally and Germany, and of their clear evocation of democratic values and the practice of liberal policies. Merkel’s informal tenure as leader of the West ended with the election of Joe Biden, but with Britain’s departure from the European Union following the 2016 referendum, Germany’s position as Washington’s principal ally within the EU had been elevated even higher. This is the main element of Angela Merkel’s legacy. When Merkel first became chancellor, Germany usually worked in tandem with France within the EU. Over time, Berlin rose to a position of preeminence, de facto making Paris its junior associate. During her tenure, Merkel worked with four French presidents: Jacques Chirac, Nicolas Sarkozy, François Hollande, and Emmanuel Macron. With every change of command at the Élysée Palace, the German chancellor appeared to stand taller. The appointment of her ally Ursula von der Leyen as president of the European Commission was a sign of the influence of both Germany and Merkel. To achieve that position, Germany had to manage major EU expansion, the debt crisis, and Brexit. Merkel did well on all three. Her only major failure was the immigration crisis of 2015, but once the negative consequences of the massive influx of migrants became apparent, she worked hard to stem the inflow and limit the damage. Berlin’s single leadership had to be accepted by its European partners, including those who were historically fearful of Berlin’s diktat. Particularly important in this regard were Germany’s eastern neighbors, Poland and the Baltic states, which were historically allergic to anything that might look like a reborn German Reich or any form of German-Russian collusion. To get their backing, Berlin had to take account of those countries’ special interests. It should be added, though, that German business gained much from the expansion of the EU to integrate Eastern European countries. Angela Merkel was the first German chancellor to speak Russian fluently, but this did not lead to a closer relationship with Moscow. In fact, the relationship grew markedly more distant, for several reasons. One was the reaffirmation of Germany’s Atlanticist credentials, even at a time when Russia’s relations with the United States were rapidly deteriorating. In 2007, Merkel was in the room in Munich when Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered his famous speech in which he lashed out at U.S. global hegemony. Another reason already alluded to was the enlargement of the European Union from 2004 to include a dozen former communist countries. This changed both the complexion of the EU and the balance within it. Many of the new entrants had had painful relations with the Soviet Union and the Russian Empire, or had even been part of the Russian realm in the past, and were still reeling from it. Berlin, which aspired to lead the expanding European Union, could not afford to ignore those sentiments. The EU’s enlargement also turned Eastern European countries into important trading partners and investment opportunities for Germany: far more so than the Russian Federation, which had long dominated Germany’s eastern trade. Finally, as the Cold War receded into the past, the division of Germany and Berlin was overcome, and the country’s physical security was assured, German society started to pay more attention to other issues, primarily environmental and climate-related, and social and political values, including human and minority rights. To the post–Cold War generation of German politicians, Russia was no longer the country that held the key to German reunification; nor were its forces a huge presence in East Germany; nor was it viewed as a land of economic opportunity in the east. Rather, post-Soviet Russia stood for a failing attempt at democratization, a grossly inefficient and primitive oligarchical economy, and an increasingly authoritarian regime led by a former KGB operative who used to work in East Germany. Angela Merkel’s personal relationship with Vladimir Putin was apparently decorous throughout, but never overly close. There was certainly no warmth there, unlike between Putin and Schroeder, or even Boris Yeltsin and Helmut Kohl. However, the German-Russian relationship initially moved forward with economic projects, political consultations, and high-level societal fora like the German-Russian Petersburg Dialogue. There was a moment in mid-2011 when Merkel publicly expressed her preference for Putin’s chosen interim successor, President Dmitry Medvedev. Like then U.S. president Barack Obama, the German chancellor saw Medvedev, in contrast to Putin, as a modernizer and a much more convenient partner for the West. At that time, Merkel and her then vice chancellor and foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier were promoting a modernization partnership with Russia in the hope that modernization would not be limited to technology and the economy — in line with Putin’s idea of a Greater Europe from Lisbon to Vladivostok, which he laid out before the German business community during a 2010 visit — but would also transform the Russian political system and society according to the Western model. In that respect, Berlin’s expectations turned out to be wishful thinking. Major disappointment set in as Putin decided to run for the Russian presidency again. The last seven-plus years of Merkel’s involvement with the Kremlin were marked and marred by the Ukraine crisis, Crimea, and the armed conflict in Donbas. As a result, the post–Cold War German-Russian partnership degenerated into a transactional relationship with increasing mutual criticism and decreasing trust. In Putin’s eyes, Berlin’s connivance with Paris and Warsaw over what the Kremlin regarded as the Maidan coup in Kyiv that toppled the elected president amounted to a massive breach of trust. In turn, Russia’s forceful reaction to the developments in Ukraine stunned Merkel and her colleagues. In vain did Putin appeal to German gratitude for Moscow having turned the key on reunification; Merkel, reflecting the views of not only the German political class, but also much of the public, saw Russia’s actions as changing borders by force and thus upsetting the post–Cold War order in Europe. Merkel took the lead in imposing rafts of EU sanctions on Russia. Unlike other Western leaders, however, Merkel did not respond to the crisis by severing all contact with Moscow in an attempt to “isolate” and thus “punish” Russia. The German chancellor, while being very critical of Russian policies, kept the line of communication to the Kremlin open. In February 2015, Merkel put at stake her own prestige by flying to Minsk for marathon negotiations to broker a ceasefire in Donbas. Since then, much of her interaction with Putin has been devoted to the conflict in Ukraine’s southeast. Her approach could be described as critical dialogue, with both sides trading critical arguments, but also looking for ways and means of managing the standoff. Germany’s critical public attitude toward Russia was not limited to Ukraine-related issues. Starting with the campaign focusing on the “values gap” with Russia and the thrashing of Germany’s own so-called Putin-Versteher, or Putin-empathizers, the criticism was becoming wider and more scathing. Accusations of Russian media meddling in German politics, of Russia’s involvement in the Bundestag hacking, and the murder of a former Chechen rebel commander in Berlin’s central Tiergarten marked a clear downward trend in the relationship. In 2020, Merkel publicly supported a German military laboratory’s findings that Russian anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny, who had been flown from Russia to Germany for emergency medical treatment, had been poisoned with a chemical nerve agent. Merkel herself visited the activist in a Berlin hospital. Symbolically, the Navalny incident closed the book on what had remained of the three-decades-long German-Russian partnership. The partnership may be in the past, but the relationship continues. In 2021, Merkel passed an important test in defending German interests from U.S. pressure. Despite the strained relations with Russia and vehement criticism from the EU’s eastern flank countries such as Poland and the Baltic states, not to mention hysterics from Ukraine, Merkel succeeded in reaching a deal with U.S. President Joe Biden on allowing the completion of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia under the Baltic Sea. Merkel’s unfailing consistency and stubborn determination under enormous pressure, which eventually led to a positive outcome for Germany, was closely watched and appreciated by the Kremlin. It was also appreciated that before leaving office, she made one last visit to Russia. Seen from Moscow, Angela Merkel’s long tenure was a period of relative, if not always palatable, predictability in German-Russian relations. Vladimir Putin often disagreed with the German chancellor, but he undoubtedly respected her. For Russian policymakers, Germany remains the European Union’s key member state. Historically, Moscow’s relations with the major powers have heavily depended on its interaction with the leaders of those powers. The future of the relationship will depend in no small measure on who succeeds her and how skilled that successor is at the art of statecraft. Merkel is leaving behind very big shoes to fill.

After almost all precincts were counted, the ruling Georgian Dream party led with 46.6% of the votes in Saturday's elections, while all of the opposition parties combined garnered 53.4%, official results showed. Critics have denounced a backsliding on democracy in Georgia, saying parliamentary elections held last October were rigged and accusing the ruling party of using criminal prosecutions to punish political opponents and journalists. Under an EU-brokered inter-party agreement in May, Georgian Dream had pledged to hold snap parliamentary elections if it won less than 43% of the municipal vote. But it unilaterally withdrew from the pact in July, sparking harsh criticism from the West, and Saturday's result frees them from the obligation to call snap polls. Georgian Dream said in a statement that the closely-watched elections ""were held at the highest democratic standards."" But opposition parties said Sunday widespread irregularities undermined the credibility of the elections, held in a tense atmosphere after Saakashvili, the country's foremost opposition leader and former president, was arrested on return from exile. ""The election results were falsified. We have witnessed intimidation and bribing of voters prior to the elections, multiple voting on the election day,"" Giorgi Baramidze, a leader of Saakashvili's United National Movement (UNM), told AFP. ""The elections' credibility has already been undermined by the fact that the leader of the opposition was first forced into exile and then arrested,"" he said referring to Saakashvili. ""We will use all the legal means to reverse the falsification."" Badri Japaridze, a leader of opposition Lelo party, said: ""The elections were marred by large-scale intimidation and bribing of voters, seriously affecting the electoral results."" In a number of major cities — including the capital Tbilisi — second round runoffs will have to be held on October 30 between mayoral candidates from the Georgian Dream and the UNM, the country's main opposition force. Saakashvili, 53, secretly returned to Georgia on Friday from Ukraine — where he heads a government agency steering reforms — ahead of the elections and was quickly detained for alleged abuse of office. The flamboyant pro-Western reformer and president in 2004-2013, denied any wrongdoing, denounced a six-year jail sentence in absentia as politically motivated and went on hunger strike following his arrest. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday he will be pressing for Saakashvili's return to Ukraine as he is a Ukrainian national and was stripped of his Georgian passport. Saakashvili's jailing aggravated the political crisis that engulfed Georgia last October when opposition parties denounced parliamentary elections as rigged, refused to take up their seats in the newly elected legislature and staged mass protests to demand snap polls. Prior to his arrest, Saakashvili had called on supporters to take to the streets ""to protect election results."" But opposition parties have so far refrained from staging protests, awaiting the conclusions from international monitors who are due to present their assessment later on Sunday. The United States has hinted at possible sanctions against Georgian officials over the country's backsliding on democracy. In comments to AFP through a representative, who visited him in prison on Saturday, Saakashvili said he returned to Georgia despite looming arrest ""to fight to the end against the oligarchic rule which kills Georgian democracy."" He was referring to former prime minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, a powerful oligarch and ruling party founder who is widely believed to be calling the shots in Georgia despite holding no political office.",1,589,97.63,57.28,17.98,1,26.77,37.52,79.63,52.29,41.26,4.07,3.06,0,0.34,0,1.7,0.51,1.02,12.05,9.17,1.53,16.47,4.92,1.7,5.09,0.17,11.21,4.58,2.04,14.94,1.87,0.51,12.73,6.96,0.68,6.28,0.51,2.21,0,1.02,0.17,2.21,0,5.94,1.19,4.75,0.34,0,0.34,0.17,0.17,0,0,12.39,7.3,0,0,3.06,0.68,2.04,4.92,0,0,0,1.7,9.85,9.51,0.34,0,2.89,1.02,0,1.87,0,0,0.51,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.17,0.17,0.85,0,0.34,0.17,0,0,0.17,0.68,0,2.21,6.28,0,1.02,5.6,0.17,0,0.17,5.43,7.81,1.19,1.36,0,0,0,0,0,15.79,4.07,5.09,0,0,1.87,4.75

Russia's population has been in near-constant decline since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, due to a low birth rate, an under-resourced healthcare system, and emigration. The coronavirus pandemic, which has killed at least 400,000 people in Russia according to the national statistic agency Rosstat, has seriously aggravated the problem. In 2020, the population shrank by 510,000 people — the sharpest decline in 15 years, Rosstat calculated. It found that the population, which numbered 146.2 million as of January 1, declined by another 595,000 people by the end of August. Russia has also seen its birth rate stagnate as the mortality rate spikes, Rosstat data shows. The country is seeing falling birth rates because the generation becoming parents now were born in the 1990s, when the birthrate fell drastically due to economic uncertainties. President Vladimir Putin, who has pointed to poverty as a key factor in limiting family size, has over the years announced a litany of financial incentives to encourage Russians to have more children to boost the population. The census comes as Russia is seeing a surge in coronavirus infections. This week the country set a pandemic high for both cases and deaths as Russia's jab drive stalls and a lack of strict restrictions allow the virus to spread unchecked. To help limit the spread, much of the census will be conducted online, while workers will be regularly tested for the virus, Rosstat said. Russia has conducted two previous census counts since the fall of the Soviet Union, in 2010 and 2002. One of the only times Russia's population has grown in the years since the Soviet collapse was in 2014, when Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine, adding more than 2.5 million people. The census will run until November 14 and preliminary population figures are expected in April.",1,323,97.45,41.89,66.28,5.16,23.07,26.93,81.11,54.18,43.65,2.79,0.31,0,0,0,0,0,2.48,16.41,11.76,5.57,15.17,6.5,2.17,6.19,0,10.53,3.41,8.67,4.95,1.55,0.31,3.1,6.19,0.62,5.26,0.93,1.55,0.31,0.31,0.31,1.24,0,3.1,0.62,2.48,0.31,0,0.31,0,0.31,0,0,3.72,1.55,0.62,0,0.31,0,0.31,1.55,0.31,0,0,0,3.72,2.17,1.24,0.31,1.86,0,0,0.93,0.93,0,3.72,2.79,2.79,0,0,0,0,0,0.93,0.31,0,0,0.62,0,0,0.31,0.31,0,4.02,9.6,0,2.48,7.74,0.93,0,0,8.36,3.72,4.64,1.24,0,0,0,0,0,13.62,4.95,6.81,0,0,1.24,0.62

Chupik, an Uzbek activist who had held asylum in Russia since 2009, was detained at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport last month, with FSB officers telling her that her refugee status was revoked for alleged “document falsification” and that she is banned from entering Russia for 30 years. She has called the move “absolute nonsense” and expressed fears she could be jailed, tortured or killed if she were repatriated to Uzbekistan. “I am currently in Armenia in a beautiful spot just on the outskirts of Yerevan,” Chupik told The Moscow Times via WhatsApp. Last week, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Chupik’s deportation to Uzbekistan should be suspended, applying Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, which is applied as an urgent measure in cases where there is an imminent risk of causing irreparable harm. Russian law enforcement had also searched the apartment of Chupik’s 84-year-old mother two days after her detention. Chupik and her mother have now applied for asylum in Ukraine and are currently awaiting a response from the Ukrainian authorities, her aides have said. Chupik, 48, fled ex-Soviet Uzbekistan in 2005 following a bloody crackdown on protesters in the city of Andijan, claiming she was tortured by Uzbek special services. In Moscow, Chupik founded the Tong Jahoni (Morning of the World) NGO which provides free legal services to migrants who have faced pressure from law enforcement agencies. Each year, hundreds of thousands of migrant workers travel to Russia from former Soviet republics, mainly those in Central Asia, in search of better wages. Many face discrimination and abuse from Russian citizens and authorities. But since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, Russia has seen a mass outflow of migrant workers, triggering efforts to tackle an emerging labor shortage in industries like construction and agriculture. Earlier this year, Russia handed a 40-year entry ban to Tajikistan-born opposition activist Saidanvar Sulaimonov in what he called retaliation for his work on a Kremlin critic’s campaign for last month’s parliamentary election.",1,353,93.47,65.13,12.93,5.91,27.15,30.88,77.9,52.41,41.93,6.8,4.53,0.28,0,0,3.68,0,2.27,11.33,6.8,3.12,15.86,5.95,2.27,4.25,0,10.76,3.68,2.83,8.78,0.57,1.13,7.08,4.25,0,4.25,0,1.7,0.57,0.85,0,1.7,0,3.4,0.85,2.55,0.85,0,0.85,0.28,0,0,0.28,11.9,5.1,0,0,1.7,0.57,2.27,6.52,0.57,0,3.68,0.57,5.38,2.55,2.55,0.28,3.68,0,0.28,3.4,0.28,0,1.13,0.57,0.57,0,0,0,0,0,0.28,0.28,0,0,0.28,0,0,0,1.13,0,3.97,8.5,0.57,1.98,5.67,0.28,0,0,6.52,5.38,3.4,0.28,0.28,0.28,0,0,0,14.73,3.68,5.67,0,0,1.42,3.97

Not weaponizing football hooligans or COVID vaccines this time, but apparently gas. From U.S National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan to British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, politicians are queuing up to blame Russia for the current global gas crisis. The trouble is that not only is this bad analysis, it is also bad politics. The economics As has been documented, the current gas crisis has numerous causes, which have combined in a singularly problematic way. A year of coronavirus (COVID-19) which saw reserves scaled down in a “gas glut”; a hard winter and a hot summer, both of which meant greater consumption; accidents interrupting supply lines. All this is exacerbated by a heightened demand from Asia, which is essentially monopolizing the liquid natural gas (LNG) which otherwise represents the fungible supply often relied on to make up for shortfalls in piped gas. And, of course, European buyers who had not wanted to commit themselves to long-term contracts as a result ended up paying spot prices. But where does Russia fit? Moscow has been fulfilling its contract commitments and, far from somehow “choking off” the gas as British sources have been claiming, is supplying close to record levels. Of course, Gazprom will be looking to maximise its profits, just as the Kremlin is inevitably trying to use the situation to push German regulators into giving the final OK to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. The morality What, though, is the sin here? First of all, Russia has no moral duty to provide more gas whenever the West wants it. So long as they observe their contractual obligations, the rest is simple market economics. To be sure, it would be very convenient for everyone else if Moscow were willing and able to increase the supply, but considering the continued grip of Western sanctions on Russia, as well as the barrage of sanctimonious critiques (which, to be fair, it is not that the current regime doesn’t deserve, but which are not levelled against other regimes which may deserve it even more), should we expect Putin to go out of his way to do us a favour? Are the U.S. and Qatari LNG suppliers who eagerly pivoted to service the seemingly insatiable Asian market also being castigated as malign market manipulators and profiteers? The question is naturally rhetorical: of course not. Besides, how far could Putin help, so long as Nord Stream 2 remains locked in regulatory limbo? It is clear that there is more capacity in the pipelines which cross Ukraine. However, Moscow is understandably reluctant to pay Kiev more transit fees. More to the point, those pipelines largely connect to legacy gas fields in the Nadym-Pur-Taz (NPT) region in West Siberia, whose capacity is in decline and which must prioritise local needs. Nord Stream 1 and 2 are fed by the new Yamal fields, but with the latter pipeline still closed, then the Russians are constrained in how much extra supply they could provide. Although there are interconnectors between the systems, even if Moscow wanted to send Yamal gas through the Central Route across Ukraine, it is unclear if they could, given that these capillaries are being used for domestic supply. In other words, it’s complex. The politics But no problem is ever so complex that politicians cannot distil it into banal simplifications and crude rhetoric. Especially when public opinion is becoming increasingly demanding, a scapegoat is always a good distraction, and these days there is no scapegoat better than a Russian one. (A scapebear?) There seem to be three main reasons for the unusually crude “analysis” being deployed over the gas crisis, each of which has a particularly problematic impact on policy, which is why this is more than just a jeremiad against crass Western political headline-chasing. Nonetheless, that lazy and self-interested search for an external excuse is certainly one of those factors. The particular problem with lazy explanations is that they often lead to lazy — and that means expensive and/or fruitless — policy responses. Talk of creating a European strategic gas reserve, for example, would be expensive and politically complex, and take years, all of which mean it would have no impact on the current situation. However, it can get much more political traction by being securitised, presented as a way of “defending” Europe against Putin's “energy weapon.” The second is that the Nord Stream 2 issue has become about much more than the pipeline but a tribal divide over the place of Russia in the world. Whether or not some of the pipelines' foes were also motivated by interests in LNG, whether selling it or receiving it, this has assumed a significance out of all proportion to the actual pipeline. Those who claim that it would somehow make Europe more dependent on Russia's “energy weapon” fail to explain quite how. Yes, it would allow Gazprom to send as little as it could through the Ukrainian pipes and thus minimize payments to Kiev, which is undoubtedly (and no doubt intentionally) bad for the Ukrainians, but it would hardly affect how much Russian gas Europe consumes. If anything, it might actually increase the EU's energy security. Although the days of Moscow turning off the gas are likely gone – the Russians cannot afford to go without the income — when Europe has suffered in the past, it was essentially as collateral, caught by the Kremlin's dispute with Kiev. Yet while Putin might be willing to play hardball with Ukraine, he would likely think twice before trying to do the same with Germany. It is worth noting that Angela Markel has been very bullish that further sanctions would result from any Russian efforts to “weaponize” the pipeline. Thus an essentially emotional campaign against Nord Stream 2 limits Europe's energy options and keeps prices high, in a last-ditch bid to punish Gazprom and the Kremlin (and, implicitly, Germany). Quite who is weaponising gas here? Thirdly, the easy assumption that whenever Russia is involved “hybrid war” and “malign influence” come in its wake, while understandable, always risks spiralling into a vicious circle. Touchy, acutely aware of its relative weaknesses and forever seeing subtle plots in Western blunders, the Kremlin tends to respond badly to overheated political rhetoric. One of the great virtues of Joe Biden's handling of Putin at the Geneva summit was to keep the tough talking to the private session, while treating Russia with respect in public. This may sound trivial, but policies are decided by people, and the ageing lords of the Kremlin take language seriously. Meanwhile, the risk is that at home, such rhetoric locks Western governments into futile and counter-productive gestures. Already I am aware of at least a couple of European foreign ministries brainstorming how to “punish Moscow for creating the gas crisis” just in case their political masters demand it. I asked one of those involved if the team actually believed Russia was to blame. Of course not, came the reply, but you know how politicians are… The wicked problem None of this is to exonerate Moscow for all the destructive and antagonistic things it does do, from poisonings in Britain to trolling in the infosphere. Indeed, to a considerable extent, it is simply reaping the fruits of years of such activities, such that too many, too easily believe too much that goes wrong is somehow down to Russia's unseen and unfriendly hand. However, there are many — analysts, experts, policymakers — who do know better or should know better. In many ways, the gas crisis is a fitting metaphor for the challenges of the modern world: complex, global, hard to fix and likely to have long and unpredictable impacts. The policies of particular countries may exacerbate it a little here, alleviate a little there. Certainly were Germany to approve Nord Stream 2 and other countries then buy gas from Russia — especially on the longer-term contracts it craves — that would help. It wouldn’t magically make the underlying issues disappear, though. The answer to problems of wicked complexity is not to pretend they are simple, not to look for a “usual suspect” to blame. It is to look for solutions of appropriate complexity. At present, for the West, this looks like a fail.

""The decision to withdraw the accreditation of eight members of the Russian delegation to NATO was done based on intelligence because these are undeclared Russian intelligence officers,"" Stoltenberg said. ""We have seen an increase in Russian malign activities, at least in Europe and therefore we need to act."" The NATO chief said that the decision to kick out the Russian representatives was not ""linked to any particular event"" — but gave no more details over the move. NATO announced Wednesday it had decided to strip the ""undeclared Russian intelligence officers"" of official accreditation to the alliance and halve the size of the Russian delegation to 10. Stoltenberg reiterated that the ""relationship between NATO and Russia is at its lowest point since the end of the Cold War. And that's because of the Russian behavior."" Ties between the West and Moscow have slumped in recent years since the Kremlin's 2014 annexation of Crimea and over its involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Russia has long had an observer mission to NATO as part of a two-decade-old NATO-Russia Council meant to promote cooperation in common security areas, but it is not a member of the U.S.-led Alliance. The Kremlin said earlier Thursday that the expulsions showed NATO members have no desire to normalise relations with Moscow. ""There is an obvious contradiction in the statements of NATO representatives about the desire to normalise relations with our country and in real actions,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. The Russian mission has been downsized once before, when seven of its members were ejected after the 2018 poisoning by the Novichok nerve agent on a Russian former double agent, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter in Britain. Accreditation applications by another three Russian diplomats were denied. Meetings of a NATO-Russia council have not been held since 2019 against the backdrop of the heightened tensions. ""We are ready to engage in meaningful dialogue with with Russia, and we are ready also to convene a NATO-Russia Council meeting,"" Stoltenberg said. ""We have actually invited Russia for a long time. So far, Russia has not responded positively."" Sky News reported that NATO's decision came after information was revealed in April about fatal explosions at a Czech ammunition depot in 2014 that Prague says involved two Russian spies — identified as allegedly implicated in the Skripal poisoning. That Czech Republic-Russia incident led to the mutual expulsion of dozens of EU and Russian diplomats and other embassy staff.",1,433,95.95,57.95,34.57,12.9,22.79,32.79,82.22,57.51,46.19,4.85,1.62,0,1.39,0,0.23,0,3.23,15.47,9.47,2.54,17.55,6,2.08,6.24,1.39,11.32,5.54,3.7,7.62,4.16,0.23,3.23,10.62,0.46,10.16,2.31,2.31,0.69,0.69,0.92,3,0,3.93,1.39,2.08,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.55,5.08,1.15,0,0.23,0,3,6,0.23,0,0.23,0.46,8.08,4.62,3.46,0,4.39,0,0,4.39,0,0,0.92,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.23,0.69,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,0.23,0,3.7,8.78,0,1.15,6,0.92,0.23,0.46,4.39,7.39,2.54,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,13.86,4.85,2.31,0,0,0.92,5.77

This is Novaya Gazeta's,” Muratov said after the Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded him and prominent journalist from the Philippines, Maria Ressa, the 2021 Peace Prize. Established in 1993, Novaya Gazeta gained a reputation for hard-hitting journalism on topics including the 2014 downing of flight MH17 and the 2016 Panama Papers leaks into offshore dealings. The paper continued its intrepid work despite the killings of six of its journalists, most notably Anna Politkovskaya in 2006, and threats and harassment of its reporters over the years. Here’s a look at some of Novaya Gazeta’s major investigative reports in recent years, both under Muratov's leadership and otherwise: Chechen anti-LGBT campaign, 2017 and 2019 Novaya Gazeta broke the news in 2017 on the alleged torture and killings of people in southern Russia’s republic of Chechnya who are suspected of being gay. Its reporting has raised international awareness of Chechnya’s alleged anti-gay purges, leading to international legal action brought outside Russian borders. Western-sanctioned Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has denied Novaya Gazeta’s reports of a broad crackdown on LGBT members, claiming that only heterosexuals live in his deeply conservative majority-Muslim region. Extrajudicial killings, 2021 Chechen security officers had also rounded up civilians and summarily executed them in sweeping anti-terror raids around the same time as the gay purges of 2017, Novaya Gazeta reported this year, citing an ex-policeman’s testimony. That report prompted officials in Chechnya, which Kadyrov has ruled with a degree of autonomy in exchange for loyalty to Moscow following two devastating separatist wars in the 1990s, to call for Novaya Gazeta’s closure. Syria mercenary beheading, 2019 Novaya Gazeta linked Russian mercenaries to the gruesome beheading, dismembering and immolation of a Syrian detainee in 2017. The publication withheld the identities of the fighters, believed to be mercenaries for Kremlin-linked private military contractor the Wagner Group, but said it stood ready to provide its materials to Russian law enforcement if they wanted to investigate the torture. The Kremlin has said the footage of the cold-blooded beheading had nothing to do with Russia’s military operations in Syria. Private military companies are illegal in Russia — a technicality that the Kremlin has used to deny Wagner’s reported presence in Syria, Ukraine, Libya, Sudan and other conflict-torn countries. Contract killings, 2018 Novaya Gazeta linked contract killings and attacks on Russian opposition activists and bloggers to U.S.-sanctioned catering magnate Yevgeny Prigozhin, who western journalists have linked to Wagner. The article, which cited interviews with a former Prigozhin associate who has since disappeared, was published days after unknown individuals sent its author, Novaya Gazeta reporter Denis Korotkov, a funeral wreath and a severed goat’s head. Prison torture, 2018 and 2019 Novaya Gazeta finally succeeded in triggering an investigation and a nationwide inspection after it published body cam footage from 2016-17 of prison guards torturing an inmate in the city of Yaroslavl northeast of Moscow. After the shocking footage put a national spotlight on the issue of prisoner abuse in Russia, the publication followed up with new videos of abuse two years later.",1,536,97.64,41.18,26.98,1.19,29.78,35.82,74.07,47.76,38.25,4.66,1.68,0.19,0,0,0.56,0.37,2.99,12.13,8.21,4.1,16.04,3.54,1.12,4.85,0.37,7.65,4.85,2.61,8.96,0.56,1.68,6.72,5.41,0.19,5.22,1.49,0.75,0.37,0.75,0,2.24,0,6.53,1.49,4.85,0.93,0,0.75,0,0,0,0,8.77,5.6,0.19,0,3.17,0,1.31,2.99,0,0,0,0.56,2.8,1.31,1.31,0.19,6.16,0,0.19,5.6,0.37,0,2.99,0,0,0,0,0,0.75,0,1.68,0,0.19,0.37,0,0,0,1.31,0.56,0,1.68,9.14,0.56,1.12,7.46,0.19,0,0,3.17,3.73,2.43,0.37,0,0,0,0,0,15.3,3.73,5.97,0,0,2.43,3.17

Long derided as a gastronomic wasteland, Russia's restaurant scene has emerged in recent years from a post-Soviet reputation for blandness, with establishments in Moscow regularly making lists of some of the world's best. Representatives of the Michelin guide — considered the international standard of restaurant rankings — released the first Moscow edition of their iconic red book at a ceremony at Moscow. Sixty-nine restaurants were recommended in all. Two restaurants — Twins Garden run by twin brothers Ivan and Sergei Berezutskiy, and chef Artem Estafev's Artest — were given two stars. Seven restaurants were given one star, including White Rabbit, whose chef Vladimir Mukhin featured in an episode of the Netflix documentary series ""Chef's Table."" None were given three stars — the Holy Grail of the restaurant world. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said at the ceremony that the release of the guide was an important event at a tough time for the restaurant industry. ""It's big moral support in this time of pandemic, when restaurants are having a particularly difficult time,"" he said. Sobyanin said it also showed Russia had rediscovered a food tradition that had suffered under the Soviet Union. ""Unfortunately during the Soviet period these traditions were lost,"" he said. ""I am proud that Moscow's restaurants have become a calling card for our fantastic city."" Michelin's international director Gwendal Poullennec told a press conference that the guide had used an international team of inspectors for its list and there was ""no compromise in our methodology."" Speaking to AFP earlier, he said Russia's food scene had been ""reinventing"" itself since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union. ""There is an evolution of the Russian culinary scene. It is more and more dynamic,"" Poullennec said. He said he was surprised by ""the quality and abundance of produce"" in Moscow restaurants, highlighting in particular the seafood, such as crab and caviar, that are ""exclusive"" elsewhere but in Russia are available at a ""reasonable price."" Russia became the 35th country to have a Michelin guide and Moscow is the first city of the former Soviet Union to be awarded stars. The selection of restaurants will appear in print and also be available via an app in 25 languages, including Russian. Michelin in December said that chefs in Moscow had set themselves apart by highlighting Russian ingredients, including king crab from the Far Eastern city of Vladivostok and smetana, the sour cream used in preparing beef stroganoff. Moscow restaurants have increasingly turned to local ingredients after Western sanctions following Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 resulted in a scarcity of many European foods. A number of restaurants that relied on meat, cheese and fish imported from the West were forced to close, while those that strived to source their ingredients from Russian regions became more competitive. In explaining why it chose Moscow, the guide last year pointed to the ""unique flavors"" of the ""nation's emblematic first courses such as borscht."" Another leading French restaurant guide, Gault et Millau, launched its first Russian edition in 2017. In 2019, Gault & Millau was sold to Russian investors. Twins Garden and White Rabbit have previously featured on the World's 50 Best Restaurants list.

243,themoscowtimes.com,1633503600,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/10/06/who-cares-about-the-pandora-papers-a75227,Who Cares About the Pandora Papers ? - The Moscow Times,English,Russia,"Another massive leak, another multi-national investigation, another slew of allegations of everything from outright corruption and money laundering to legal but ethically problematic tax avoidance and financial engineering. The Pandora Papers, a trove of almost 12 million documents, have shined a light on the activities of over 330 politicians and public officials in more than 90 countries and territories. According to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, Russian nationals are “disproportionately represented,” accounting for 14% of the more than 27,000 named companies. The news is at once dramatic, predictable, and ⁠— alas ⁠— arguably pointless. This no doubt sounds deeply churlish, an offense to the 600-plus journalists from 150 different news outlets including Russia's iStories, who dug into the data for two years, connecting the dots and uncovering the faces behind the anonymous offshore shell companies. The Papers will, one can hope, provide further impetus for efforts in the West to bring meaningful transparency to what is, for all the ritual declarations of politicians, bankers and regulators, still a financial system that offers numerous opportunities for legal avoidance of tax and scrutiny to those able to afford the right lawyers and accountants. The way former British prime minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie sidestepped paying $423,000 property tax by buying a $8,75m building in a posh London neighborhood through an offshore company based in the British Virgin Islands has certainly provided a new focus for criticism both of the couple, but also this particular legal loophole. The Russian Response When it comes to Russia, while a cast of the high and the mighty appear, inevitably media attention has focused on anything that can be linked with Putin, notably allegations about the family of a reputed former girlfriend. That reflects Western media obsessions as much as anything else. But does it really matter?  First of all, the news can be mobilized for political purposes in other ways, too. The relatively innocuous discovery that before his election, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy moved millions of dollars assets into a network of offshores, in collaboration with his aid Serhiy Shefir and present security service chief Ivan Bakanov, has been pounced on with glee not just by his political enemies but also the Russian media. Given his carefully cultivated image as the one honest man in Ukrainian politics, the impression of impropriety ⁠— even if everything he did was legal ⁠— is a problem. Secondly, the very scale of the revelations dilutes their impact by contributing to the sense ⁠— not entirely inaccurate ⁠— that everyone with power and money is much the same. That said, Beijing’s magnates and politicians are surprisingly absent, not least given the ample evidence there is of systemic corruption in China. Likewise, there is a dearth of Americans, and the notion that they never abuse financial loopholes does rather stretch credulity. No wonder that Russian sources also rush to portray this as a strategic leak by the US intelligence community intended to undermine the Kremlin. It has to be said, though, that this would seem to be a rather scattershot and slow-motion attack. Would Washington really also embarrass so many allies in the quest to air some dirty Russian laundry? In any case, while individuals may be turning to their lawyers and PR consultants, how much real impact will this have? The sorry truth would seem to be that by now no one is either surprised nor mobilized by these kind of revelations. Do any Russians really presume that these people weren't fiddling the books? Will it comes as a shock that, for example, Sergei Chemezov, CEO of Russian state defence conglomerate Rostec, has a superyacht registered through an offshore? They are probably more surprised that he does not moor it at a secret Pacific island hideaway populated by genetically-engineered unicorns. The Navalny dilemma This is not just about the Pandora Papers, although they do seem to demonstrate that more is not always better, it also speaks to a fundamental political challenge facing Team Navalny.  Their 'He's not Dimon to you' video had the virtue of dismantling Dmitry Medvedev's reputation as being one of the few honest figures in the regime. 'Putin's Palace' was not just their first direct attack on the monarch, it had a voyeuristic “cribs of the rich and famous” dimension. I suspect many watched not for the forensic analysis of the financing but the pole-dance hookah bar. Where do you, can you, go from there? It is all very well going after Sergei Lavrov, and other boyars, but there is surely a law of diminishing returns. Once there is a general assumption that everyone is a crook and a thief, then further revelations may enthuse your base, but are hardly likely to expand it.

Footage published on the Ukrainian armed forces’ Facebook page showed the Bayraktar TB2k targeting and shooting a Soviet-era howitzer it identified as the pro-Russian forces’ D-30. The Ukrainian armed forces accused the separatists of wounding one soldier and killing another with the D-30 near the eastern town of Hranitne on the front line. “Bayraktar was used in order to force the enemy to cease fire,” the Ukrainian armed forces’ general staff said in a statement. “After that, the shelling of Ukrainian positions stopped.” The drone strike did not inflict any military or civilian casualties, Russia’s Interfax news agency quoted an unnamed source in the self-proclaimed, separatist-held Donetsk People’s Republic as saying Wednesday. The neighboring separatist-held Luhansk People’s Republic accused Kiev of using the Bayraktar in violation of ceasefire agreements that ban the deployment of foreign drones on the front line. Tuesday’s drone strike is the first since Turkey delivered the first batch of Bayraktar TB2 to Ukraine in July. The Turkish private company Baykar, which produces the armed drones, describes the TB2 model as a ""medium altitude long endurance tactical unmanned aerial vehicle capable of conducting intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and armed attack missions"" with a range of up to 27 hours. Media reports said Kiev plans to buy around 50 Bayraktar TB2 drones, a flagship model that has been used in conflicts against Russian proxies in Syria, Libya and the Nagorno-Karabakh region at the center of a decades-long dispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Ukraine and Turkey signed a memorandum in late September to establish a joint training and maintenance center for the drones in Ukraine. This month, Ukraine’s foreign minister said it plans to build a factory to produce Bayraktar drones in the country. The sale of drones to Kiev places Ankara in a delicate position, as Turkey also cooperates in the defense sector with Russia, Ukraine's rival. The Kremlin said Wednesday that Turkey’s supply of drones to Ukraine risks destabilizing the eastern Ukraine conflict despite Moscow’s “special” relations with Ankara. The Ukrainian army has been locked in a long-running conflict with separatist fighters in Donetsk and Luhansk since 2014 after Moscow annexed the peninsula of Crimea from Kiev. The conflict has claimed more than 13,000 lives. Ukraine and its Western allies accuse Russia of sending troops and arms to support the separatists, which Moscow denies.

Both Moscow and Kiev claimed ownership of the Scythian treasures dating back to the 2nd century B.C., which were loaned to Amsterdam’s Allard Pierson Museum. The museum’s “Crimea: Gold and Secrets of the Black Sea” exhibit opened in February 2014, one month before Russia seized the Black Sea peninsula from Ukraine. The Amsterdam Court of Appeal sided with Kiev and ruled that the collection of more than 2,000 items should be returned to Ukraine, the Dutch broadcaster NOS reported. “Although the objects originate in Crimea,” the judge said, according to a video posted by Russia’s state-run RIA Novosti news agency, “they are part of Ukraine’s heritage after it became independent in 1991.” According to RIA Novosti, the judge said her ruling is subject to appeal with the Netherlands’ supreme court. A lawyer for the Russian-held Crimean museums told RIA Novosti they have three months to appeal the ruling, in which case deliberations could last another year. Russian lawmakers and Crimean museum directors were quick to condemn the Dutch court ruling, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy vowed to “return Crimea” like it did the Scythian gold. Four Crimean museums launched a joint legal bid seven years ago to force the Allard Pierson Museum to return the historic collection of archaeological artefacts dubbed the ""Scythian Gold"" to the peninsula. The impressive collection spans the 2nd century BC to the late medieval era, when Crimea was at the crossroads of ancient trade routes through an area dominated by the Scythian people. A lower court said in 2016 that the treasures were part of Ukraine's cultural heritage and must be returned instead to Kiev, adding that Crimea was not considered a sovereign state. The Crimean museums appealed against the judgement, saying the artifacts belonged there, and the Dutch court of appeal said in 2019 that it needed more time to decide on the matter. The treasures themselves have remained in ""safe storage"" in the Allard Pierson museum, which is the archaeological museum of the University of Amsterdam, pending the appeal.

The country of 2.6 million people wedged between Romania and Ukraine gets gas from Russia via its pro-Russian separatist region of Transnistria and Ukraine. Gazprom has hiked prices from $550 per thousand cubic meters last month to $790 this month – a level Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Spinu said was ""not justified and not realistic"" for Europe's poorest country. ""We face a critical situation,"" Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita said Friday. She told parliament Moldova would be seeking supplies from EU countries and thanked Romania and Ukraine for already supplying some gas. While Gazprom and its daughter company Moldovagaz last month agreed to extend their existing contract for supplies until Oct. 31, Gavrilita said Moldovagaz ""is not keeping its word."" The company is not providing the required volumes of natural gas, she said, with Moldova receiving a third less than usual for October. The prime minister said Moldova and Gazprom were continuing negotiations but that the ex-Soviet country has ""no confidence"" in the success of the talks and ""must take action"" or be ""left without gas."" The month-long state of emergency gives Moldovan utility company Energocom the power to secure gas from other countries. The country's gas shortages come amid skyrocketing gas prices that some in Europe have blamed on Moscow not providing additional supplies to put pressure on the continent. Some experts say Russia has boosted prices as pressure on Moldova for electing a pro-European president in Maia Sandu last year, who has said she wants to fold the breakaway region of Transnistria back into Moldova.

In 2016, a lower Dutch court ruled that the treasures were part of Ukraine's cultural heritage and must be returned to Kiev — not to the museums that launched the petition — on the grounds that Crimea was not considered a sovereign state. The Crimean museums appealed the judgement. But on Tuesday, the Dutch court of appeal ruled that the gold should be held by Ukraine ""pending stabilization in the Crimea.""",1,354,98.21,50.15,20.4,31.93,20.82,29.66,76.27,56.78,46.33,4.8,1.69,0,0.85,0,0.56,0.28,3.11,18.08,14.41,1.41,15.25,7.06,1.98,3.95,0.56,10.45,4.8,3.11,7.06,1.13,1.69,4.24,6.5,0.28,6.21,1.41,1.41,1.98,0.28,0.56,1.69,0,3.11,1.98,1.13,0.28,0.28,0,0,0,0,0,8.19,4.24,0.28,0,0.28,1.13,2.82,3.11,0,0,0.56,0.28,3.11,1.69,1.41,0,5.08,1.13,0,2.82,1.41,0,0.28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.28,0.85,0,0,0,0.56,0.85,0,1.69,6.21,0.28,1.69,5.37,0,0,0,5.93,8.76,0.56,0.85,0.28,0.28,0,0,0,18.36,4.8,3.39,0,0,2.54,7.63

Defense Chief Heads to Black Sea Region",English,Russia,"U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin headed to the Black Sea region Sunday aiming to shore up alliances with countries pressured by Russia and show gratitude for their contributions to the two-decade war in Afghanistan. Austin will visit Georgia, Romania and Ukraine before taking part in the in-person defense ministers summit at NATO in Brussels on October 21-22. ""We are reassuring and reinforcing the sovereignty of countries that are on the front lines of Russian aggression,"" a senior U.S. defense official told reporters ahead of the trip. All three countries are in the NATO orbit — Romania a full member and Georgia and Ukraine partner states. All three also sit on the rim of the Black Sea, where Russia has sought to expand its own influence and prevent expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the US-European alliance. Russia has occupied Ukraine's Crimea and has troops stationed in Georgia's breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. And Kiev is battling pro-Russian separatists in the country's east, in a conflict that has cost 13,000 lives. In June Russian forces menaced Dutch and British warships as they sailed near Crimea. Austin will also extend thanks to its partners for their contributions, and significant losses, as part of coalition forces in Afghanistan over two decades, before the hasty U.S. exit this year that ceded the country to the Taliban. ""We are going to be showing recognition and appreciation for the sacrifices and the commitments of our partners and allies,"" the official said. In Georgia, Austin will meet with Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili and Minister of Defense Juansher Burchuladze, with a key aim to keep up defense cooperation as a three-year U.S. Army training program expires this year. Georgia hopes Austin's visit will help advance its case for becoming a full NATO member. It will be ""another clear message from the U.S. in support of Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, its stable and democratic development, and for the country's Euro-Atlantic goals"" Foreign Minister David Zalkaliani said Wednesday. ""We expect that meetings will be focused on further deepening our cooperation, regional security issues, and the process of Georgia's NATO integration,"" he said. In Ukraine, Austin will have talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky and Minister of Defense Andriy Taran, both of whom visited Washington at the beginning of September to press their case for NATO membership with President Joe Biden. And in Romania, he will see President Klaus Iohannis and Minister of National Defense Nicolae-Ionel Ciuca, amid a fresh political crisis in the country. In all three, the United States wants to expand defense support but also sees problems of democratic development and corruption. In Georgia, tens of thousands of protestors were out in the streets this week over the arrest of ex-president and opposition leader Mikheil Saakashvili and over allegations of fraud in recent elections. Ukraine is under heavy pressure from the West, which provides the country extensive aid, to halt rampant graft. ""It is our belief that strengthening democratic institutions creates greater resilience against Russian influence and external manipulation,"" the U.S. official said. ""Our bilateral assistance is actually very much focused on the specific aspects of institutional reform that are necessary for NATO. And that applies to both Georgia and to Ukraine."" Austin will end the week at NATO headquarters in Brussels, where ties with the U.S., frayed by the previous administration of Donald Trump, took a fresh hit last month when Washington unexpectedly announced a new pact with Australia and Britain focused on China in the Indo-Pacific region. The US official said Austin would reinforce U.S. commitment to the pact and press for military adaptation to address future threats.

Russia’s Foreign Ministry accused Ukrainian forces of detaining ceasefire observer Andrei Kosyak last Wednesday and failing to inform Moscow via diplomatic channels within an allotted three-day period. Ukraine says Kosyak was a Russian citizen carrying out an undercover reconnaissance mission for the separatists. “We call on Ukraine to… stop provocations on the contact line in Donbass, report the location of Russian citizen [Andrei] Kosyak and grant Russian consular staff access to him,” spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. Russian-backed separatists in the Donbass — the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk regions in southeastern Ukraine — have been locked in a 7-year war with Ukrainian forces that has killed some 13,000 people, according to a United Nations tally. “We regard Ukraine’s actions as treacherous and provocative,” Zakharova said in a statement on the Foreign Ministry’s website. Separatist-controlled Luhansk’s de-facto leader Leonid Pasechnik had identified Kosyak as the breakaway region’s “officer” who was overseeing the ceasefire during road clearing work when he was captured. Zakharova urged Europe’s main security body, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), to give a “principled assessment” of Kosyak’s detention. Protests demanding Kosyak’s release temporarily suspended the OSCE conflict monitoring mission’s work in separatist-controlled Horlivka in recent days. The mission continued after the protesters had left the Horlivka hotel housing its observers, Reuters reported Monday.

Moldovan Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Spinu was due to meet with the head of Russia's state-controlled energy giant Gazprom, Alexei Miller, in St. Petersburg on Wednesday. Spinu's government has declared a state of emergency and imported gas from outside Russia – its Soviet-era master – for the first time in its history after Gazprom hiked prices for the impoverished country. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday's talks will have an ""absolutely commercial nature."" ""There is no politicization here and there cannot be,"" he said. Russian President Vladimir Putin said this month that allegations from European capitals that Moscow was using energy as a geopolitical weapon were ""politically charged babble that have no grounds."" Moldova's contract with Gazprom ran out at the end of September. A deal has been reached for October but the Moldovan government said Moscow is sending far less gas to the country than usual. Last week, Russian media reported that Gazprom is threatening to cut the country off if it does not settle its debts and sign a new contract by December. Before heading to Russia, Spinu said he will demand ""transparent and fair prices"" from Gazprom at the talks. Wedged between Romania and Ukraine, the country of 2.6 million receives gas from Russia via its pro-Moscow separatist region of Transnistria and Ukraine. It signed a contract with Poland for natural gas deliveries this week, in what the government hailed as ""the first acquisition of gas from alternative sources in Moldova's history.""

During a bitter standoff with Moscow, Moldova declared a state of emergency and for the first time signed a gas supply deal with a non-Russian country. But on Friday both sides announced they had agreed to extend their previous agreement by five years, with deliveries to start from November 1. ""The parties reached an agreement on the price formula, the audit of the Moldova-Gaz debt and on subsequent dialogue for repayments,"" Moldovan foreign ministry spokesman Daniel Voda said in a statement. Gazprom said in a separate statement that the extension was made on ""mutually beneficial terms"". The agreement was reached after talks in Saint Petersburg, where Gazprom has its headquarters, between Moldova's Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Spinu and the Russian state-controlled firm's CEO Alexei Miller. Wedged between Romania and Ukraine, Moldova has traditionally received gas from Russia via its pro-Moscow separatist region of Transnistria and through Ukraine. But Moldova's contract with Gazprom expired in September. Gazprom extended the contract until the end of October but raised prices, which Spinu said at the time was ""not justified and not realistic"" for Europe's poorest country. As well as declaring a state of emergency, Moldova signed a contract to buy natural gas from Poland -- the first time it has turned to a supplier other than Russia. Voda on Friday said that Moldova ""received insufficient volumes of gas from Gazprom based on the one-month extension of the expired contract with a three-fold price increase"". He said the Gazprom deal had been extended ""for another five years based on the price formula proposed by the Moldovan side"", but did not give further details about prices. Europe is in the throes of an energy crisis with gas prices soaring to record highs as economies come back online after the end of pandemic lockdowns and renewables like solar and wind see a slowdown in supplies. Critics in Western capitals blame Russia for the price hikes, saying Moscow is not upping deliveries to pressure Europe to agree more long-term contracts and for the certification of the recently completed controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Some have also accused Moscow of raising prices for Moldova after the election last year of pro-European President Maia Sandu. For its part, Moscow accused Moldova or being late on payments and had threatened to turn off the tap entirely.

Kiev slammed as “political” this week’s contract that will supply 4.5 billion cubic meters of Russian natural gas to Hungary every year until 2036 through non-Ukrainian transit routes. “Gazprom stopped gas transit through Ukraine to Hungary,” Yuri Vitrenko, the CEO of Ukraine’s pipeline operator Naftogaz, wrote on Facebook. Vitrenko accused Gazprom of using gas exports as a “weapon” and said the Hungary deal “clearly demonstrates” its intent after Russia launches another pipeline that bypasses Ukraine to deliver gas to Germany, Nord Stream 2. “A joint statement from the United States and Germany indicates that in case of the Kremlin using gas as a weapon, there should be an appropriate reaction,” he said, referring to a U.S.-German deal in July that would threaten Russia with sanctions and extend gas transit through Ukraine. “We are now waiting for sanctions imposed on a 100% subsidiary of Gazprom, the Nord Stream 2 operator,” the Naftogaz CEO said. Gazprom and the Kremlin have dismissed Ukraine’s concerns about the loss of its role as a transit provider. Russia and Gazprom have also maintained that the $12-billion Nord Stream 2 would increase the stability of Russian gas supplies to Europe. Ukraine’s accusations come amid calls by European parliamentarians to investigate possible market manipulation by Gazprom amid record-high gas prices in Europe. The EU lawmakers claim that the company refuses to export gas to exert pressure on Europe as Nord Stream 2 awaits certification by German regulators after its recent completion. The Kremlin says Russia is fulfilling its gas export obligations under existing contracts and denies that it is attempting to speed up the Nord Stream 2 approval process through natural gas export manipulation. Ukraine makes around $3 billion a year by transiting Russian gas to Europe — a commercial relationship which has persisted despite the ongoing war between Russian-backed separatists in the Donbass and Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.",1,344,97.33,45.22,6.76,4.42,28.67,35.17,68.02,46.51,38.08,5.52,0.58,0,0.29,0,0.29,0,4.94,12.5,7.56,3.78,17.15,3.2,1.74,5.23,0,7.27,2.62,2.62,6.69,0.58,0.87,5.23,6.1,0.29,5.81,0.29,2.03,1.16,0.29,0.29,1.16,0,2.62,0.29,2.33,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.1,4.07,0,0,1.16,0.58,1.74,1.74,0,0,0,0.29,5.23,3.2,2.03,0,4.94,0,0,3.49,1.16,0.29,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.29,0.29,0,0.58,0,0,0.87,0,2.33,6.1,0.29,0.87,5.23,0,0,0,3.78,1.74,2.91,0.58,0,0,0,0,0,14.83,4.36,2.62,0,0,2.03,5.81

Viktor Bryukhanov was the plant’s first and only director during its years of operation, having also managed the construction of the Chernobyl nuclear station from 1970 to 1977. Bryukhanov was fired within weeks of the April 1986 explosion. Authorities in Soviet Ukraine sentenced him to 10 years in prison on charges of safety violations. He was released after he had served half of his jail term. The Chernobyl nuclear power station’s press service announced Bryukhanov’s passing on its Facebook page Wednesday. It did not indicate a cause of death. “The plant team and administration express their deepest condolences to the family and friends of the deceased,” it said. Bryukhanov was famously portrayed by Con O’Neill in HBO’s critically acclaimed 2019 “Chernobyl” miniseries, which documented the aftermath of the nuclear accident and the Soviet-era mismanagement of the response efforts. The April 1986 explosion at the Chernobyl power plant in Soviet Ukraine spread radioactive material across much of the Northern Hemisphere, affecting tens of thousands of people. Secret documents declassified by Ukraine earlier this year showed Bryukhanov’s first post-disaster report assured the authorities that radiation levels following the meltdown were “under control.” Born in Soviet Uzbekistan on Dec. 1, 1935, Bryukhanov relocated to Ukraine, also part of the U.S.S.R., in 1966 after graduating with an electrical engineering degree from the Tashkent Polytechnic Institute and working at the country’s thermal power plant.

Writing in the Kommersant business daily, Medvedev criticized Zelenskiy as “weak,” “ignorant” and “unreliable” — without referring to him by name — and attacked the country’s “complete dependence” on the United States. “How can you negotiate and strike deals with him?” wrote Medvedev, who was demoted last year from the post of prime minister to the newly created position of deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council. “It’s pointless for us to deal with vassals.” Medvedev also accused the Ukrainian leader of working with neo-Nazi and fascist groups, and made references to Zelenskiy’s Jewish roots. Medvedev slammed the Ukrainian president for “serving the most rabid nationalist forces in Ukraine” and warned that “at some point, when the political situation changes, they’ll sew a yellow star on your back.” Russia has for years criticized what it sees as a powerful fascist element behind various anti-Russia policies and movements in Ukraine. “Appeasing these attitudes clearly disgusts him, since his and his family’s whole history stands against such vileness,” Medvedev said. “But, alas, he has to. Otherwise, they’ll smear his brains against the wall. So he is forced to preach their ideology.” The former prime minister recommended Moscow wait for “sane” figures to replace Zelenskiy and other Ukrainian leaders before the Kremlin considers opening negotiations. “Russia knows how to wait. We are patient people,” Medvedev wrote. The Kremlin said later Monday that Medvedev’s article “runs in unison” with Russia’s view of the current Ukrainian government.",1,327,92.83,70.26,24.81,2.23,18.17,37.92,78.29,53.82,41.9,7.03,4.89,0,0.61,0.61,2.45,0.92,2.14,11.93,7.34,0.61,15.9,3.98,2.45,6.42,0.61,10.4,5.5,2.14,8.26,0.92,0.61,6.73,9.17,0,9.17,1.83,2.45,0.61,0,0.31,4.28,0,4.59,0.92,3.67,0.31,0,0.31,0,0,0,0,18.04,8.87,0.31,0.31,1.83,0.61,4.89,8.87,0.31,0,0,2.45,6.73,4.59,2.14,0,6.12,0,0,5.5,0.31,0.61,0.92,0.61,0,0,0.31,0,0,0,0,0.61,0,0,0,0.31,0,0,0.92,0.31,1.83,7.03,0.31,1.22,4.89,0.92,0,0,5.2,3.98,3.67,1.22,0,0,0,0,0,24.16,5.2,4.28,0.31,0,3.67,10.7

Moscow said President Vladimir Putin, his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel instructed the ministers to work toward a meeting during a joint telephone call Monday. According to the Kremlin, it would take place within the framework of the ""Normandy Four"" — which usually brings together officials from Moscow and Kiev under the mediation of Paris and Berlin. The Kremlin did not say in its statement if Ukraine would take part in the meeting. However France's presidency said that it should involve Ukraine. The presidency also said in a statement that Macron and Merkel held a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy before speaking to Putin. Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert also confirmed the plans for the meeting, for which a date has not yet been set. The Kremlin said the leaders had instructed their foreign ministers to ""intensify their contacts and work"" after a ""difficult"" situation in eastern Ukraine. The leaders also agreed to consider organizing a summit, the Russian and German statements said. During the phone call, Putin accused the Kiev authorities of ""stubbornly evading"" fulfilling agreements reached at peace talks. France and Germany have been mediators in the conflict between Kiev and pro-Moscow separatists since 2015 in the so-called Normandy format and have been overseeing a fragile ceasefire. Angela Merkel visited both Moscow and Kiev in August. Afterward, she then expressed her hope that peace talks on the conflict between Kiev and pro-Russia separatists would continue after she left power. The Ukrainian army is locked in a simmering conflict with breakaway fighters in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions that erupted after Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014. The conflict has claimed more than 13,000 lives. Ukraine and its Western allies accuse Russia of sending troops and arms to support the separatists, which Moscow denies. The European Union on Monday imposed sanctions on eight more officials accused of targeting opponents of Russia's seizure of Crimea, ahead of a visit to Kiev by the bloc's top officials.

Clashes have regularly broken out in the east in recent weeks, undermining a ceasefire brokered last year that had raised hopes of ending a conflict that erupted in 2014 after Russia annexed Crimea. The Ukrainian army said that one serviceman was killed on Saturday when separatist fighters opened fire with small arms, while another soldier ""received a gunshot bullet wound incompatible with life"" on Monday. The fresh clashes come as Russia has massed thousands of its soldiers on its border with Ukraine, with the White House last week saying the number of Russian troops at the border was now greater than at any time since 2014. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's spokeswoman told AFP on Monday that Russia now has 41,000 troops on Ukraine's eastern border and 42,000 soldiers on the Crimean peninsula. Spokeswoman Yulia Mendel also said that Zelenskiy had sent a query to the Kremlin in late March requesting talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin over the escalating conflict, but was yet to receive an answer. ""We hope that President Vladimir Putin does not refuse dialogue,"" Mendel told AFP. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, however, denied that Moscow had received a request for talks. ""I am not aware of any such enquiries in recent days,"" he told reporters on Monday. The Kremlin, which has not denied the troop movements, has said it is not moving towards war with Ukraine, but also that it ""will not remain indifferent"" to the fate of Russian speakers in the east. The conflict, which has claimed more than 13,000 lives, has seen 28 Ukrainian soldiers killed since the start of the year compared to 50 in all of 2020.

Witnesses filmed around 30 unknown individuals barging into the office of Memorial, a group which documents Soviet-era repressions and victims of Josef Stalin’s Great Terror, shouting “fascists,” “shame” and telling viewers to leave because “the screening is over.” When police later appeared, they handcuffed the entrance doors to Memorial’s office and locked its staff and attendees inside for several hours, the group’s lawyer said. They also dismantled the office’s fire alarm system and took away a video recording device, the independent Novaya Gazeta paper reported. The film being shown was Polish director Agnieszka Holland’s “Mr. Jones,” released in 2019. It tells the story of Welsh journalist Gareth Jones, one of the first Western journalists to report on the 1932-33 Ukrainian famine, known as the Holodomor. “Of course [the attack] was against Memorial and not the film,” Memorial spokeswoman Natalia Petrova told Reuters. “The film was just a pretext,” she added. Russian authorities have for years attempted to thwart Memorial’s work, activists say, including through fines and searches of their premises across the country. Several Memorial activists have been imprisoned on what the group says are politically motivated charges, including Oyub Titiev, head of Memorial’s office in Chechnya and Yury Dmitriyev, head of its Karelian branch. Scholars estimate between 4-7.5 million people were killed in the Holodomor, a man-made disaster that Kiev and a handful of other countries have declared a genocide. Moscow has rejected those assertions and interpretation of the causes of the famine has remained a wedge between the two countries. The screening of “Mr. Jones” comes at a sensitive time for relations between Russia and Ukraine, amid the protracted war between Ukrainian government forces and pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine. Memorial lawyer Natalia Morozova accused police of allowing most of the men who had stormed the group's offices to leave without being questioned. They “didn’t show much zeal to detain even those who they managed to catch,” Morozova told the RBC news website. She added that police conducted lengthy interrogations of viewers and Memorial staff, forcing them to stay inside and provide detailed written statements. Lawyers were only allowed inside around midnight — four hours after the disruption — with staff and police on site until at least 1 a.m. Moscow time. Russian authorities labeled Memorial a foreign agent in 2014. The designation imposes onerous financial auditing requirements on the group and forces it to add public disclaimers declaring itself a “foreign agent” to every one of its publications. The organization was founded in the final years of the Soviet Union, during a period of openness ushered in by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbochev.",1,482,98.24,66.85,20.02,4.26,22.95,32.57,80.91,52.28,43.57,4.77,2.07,0,0,0,0.41,1.24,2.7,15.15,10.58,3.11,16.6,3.73,2.07,4.77,0.41,8.09,4.15,4.56,7.26,0.21,0.83,6.43,5.81,0.21,5.6,0.83,1.66,0,0.62,0.41,1.87,0,2.9,0.41,2.49,0.41,0,0.41,0.21,0,0,0,13.28,6.64,0,0.41,1.45,0.83,3.32,6.85,0,0,0.62,0.83,3.32,1.24,1.87,0.21,6.43,1.04,0,4.77,0.62,0,3.11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.7,0.21,0,0.41,0.62,0,0,0,0,0,2.07,9.54,0.41,0.83,7.26,0.83,0.21,0.21,3.11,4.98,1.66,0,0,0,0,0,0,17.22,5.19,4.77,0,0,1.87,5.39

The latest step pushing the Baltic Sea pipeline to completion comes as Europe faces an energy crisis with natural gas reserves at a low level and energy prices surging. ""The gas-in procedure for the first string of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline has started,"" Nord Stream 2 AG said in a statement. ""This string will be gradually filled to build the required inventory and pressure as a prerequisite for the later technical tests,"" said the Switzerland-based company, which is owned by a subsidiary of Russian gas giant Gazprom. It said it would publish more information about ""further technical steps in due time."" Nord Stream 2 has for years divided European capitals and raised tensions between the bloc and Washington. The pipeline diverts supplies from an existing route through Ukraine and is expected to deprive Europe's ally of an estimated 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) annually in transit fees from Russia. Ukraine — in conflict with Russia since Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea — has warned Europe that Nord Stream 2 could be used by Moscow to exert pressure. The United States has reluctantly signed off on the project, but says it will sanction Moscow if the pipeline is used as a weapon. ""We continue to oppose this pipeline,"" U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said on Monday. ""We continue to believe it is a geopolitical project of the Russian Federation and we will continue to apply the law consistent with our periodic reviews which, of course, remain ongoing."" When Gazprom announced last month that construction was complete, Kiev vowed to continue lobbying against the project ""even after the gas is turned on."" Gas prices in Europe around the same time were skyrocketing in anticipation of higher winter demand and the International Energy Agency urged Russia open the taps. Moscow has said that it is waiting for Nord Stream 2 to come online before delivering more gas, but said the pipeline would help combat surging gas prices in Europe. Running from Russia's Baltic coast to northeastern Germany, the underwater, 1,200-kilometer (745-mile) pipeline follows the same route as Nord Stream 1, which was completed over a decade ago. Like its twin, Nord Stream 2 will be able to pipe 55 billion cubic meters of gas per year to Europe, increasing the continent's access to relatively cheap natural gas at a time of falling domestic production. Germany, Europe's top economy, imports around 40% of its gas from Russia, and Berlin believes the pipeline has a role to play in the country's transition away from coal and nuclear energy.",1,457,97.51,41.36,40.89,9.65,26.88,26.48,73.96,53.83,41.14,4.38,0.88,0,0.88,0,0,0,3.5,12.47,9.19,4.38,16.63,5.69,1.75,4.6,0,10.72,5.69,5.03,2.63,1.31,0.22,1.09,5.47,0,5.47,0.88,0.88,0.66,0.44,0.44,2.19,0,2.19,0.44,1.53,0.22,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.03,3.72,0.44,0,0.66,0,2.41,1.53,0,0.22,0,0.22,3.06,1.53,0.66,0.88,5.03,0.22,0,3.06,1.75,0,0.22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.44,0,0.22,0.22,0.88,0,0,0.66,0,2.41,8.53,0.22,2.19,6.78,0,0,0.22,5.47,4.6,3.72,1.31,0,0,0,0,0,14.44,4.38,3.94,0,0,1.31,4.81

""The decision to withdraw the accreditation of eight members of the Russian delegation to NATO was done based on intelligence because these are undeclared Russian intelligence officers,"" Stoltenberg said. ""We have seen an increase in Russian malign activities, at least in Europe and therefore we need to act."" The NATO chief said that the decision to kick out the Russian representatives was not ""linked to any particular event"" — but gave no more details over the move. NATO announced Wednesday it had decided to strip the ""undeclared Russian intelligence officers"" of official accreditation to the alliance and halve the size of the Russian delegation to 10. Stoltenberg reiterated that the ""relationship between NATO and Russia is at its lowest point since the end of the Cold War. And that's because of the Russian behavior."" Ties between the West and Moscow have slumped in recent years since the Kremlin's 2014 annexation of Crimea and over its involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Russia has long had an observer mission to NATO as part of a two-decade-old NATO-Russia Council meant to promote cooperation in common security areas, but it is not a member of the U.S.-led Alliance. The Kremlin said earlier Thursday that the expulsions showed NATO members have no desire to normalise relations with Moscow. ""There is an obvious contradiction in the statements of NATO representatives about the desire to normalise relations with our country and in real actions,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. The Russian mission has been downsized once before, when seven of its members were ejected after the 2018 poisoning by the Novichok nerve agent on a Russian former double agent, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter in Britain. Accreditation applications by another three Russian diplomats were denied. Meetings of a NATO-Russia council have not been held since 2019 against the backdrop of the heightened tensions. ""We are ready to engage in meaningful dialogue with with Russia, and we are ready also to convene a NATO-Russia Council meeting,"" Stoltenberg said. ""We have actually invited Russia for a long time. So far, Russia has not responded positively."" Sky News reported that NATO's decision came after information was revealed in April about fatal explosions at a Czech ammunition depot in 2014 that Prague says involved two Russian spies — identified as allegedly implicated in the Skripal poisoning. That Czech Republic-Russia incident led to the mutual expulsion of dozens of EU and Russian diplomats and other embassy staff.",1,433,95.95,57.95,34.57,12.9,22.79,32.79,82.22,57.51,46.19,4.85,1.62,0,1.39,0,0.23,0,3.23,15.47,9.47,2.54,17.55,6,2.08,6.24,1.39,11.32,5.54,3.7,7.62,4.16,0.23,3.23,10.62,0.46,10.16,2.31,2.31,0.69,0.69,0.92,3,0,3.93,1.39,2.08,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.55,5.08,1.15,0,0.23,0,3,6,0.23,0,0.23,0.46,8.08,4.62,3.46,0,4.39,0,0,4.39,0,0,0.92,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.23,0.69,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,0.23,0,3.7,8.78,0,1.15,6,0.92,0.23,0.46,4.39,7.39,2.54,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,13.86,4.85,2.31,0,0,0.92,5.77

Her legacy will live on long after she steps down from the leadership. While firmly embedded within the European Union, Germany has essentially become its sole, though by no means, absolute leader. It is a peaceful champion of a soft European version of liberalism. Vocal support for values does not, however, translate into interventionism. Nor does it prevent Germany from pursuing its business interests or waging a pragmatic foreign policy — within the limits of the EU/NATO framework. Merkel’s leadership was almost always steady and dependable, and her policies were largely predictable. True, neither Germany within the EU nor the EU within the U.S.-led system have achieved strategic autonomy on her watch, but that was hardly Merkel’s objective. Viewed from Moscow, Merkel’s legacy can be summarized as follows: reconfirmation of Germany’s Atlanticist orientation; achievement of a primus inter pares position within the European Union; and distancing from Russia, while keeping in touch with it. In 2005, Merkel succeeded Gerhard Schroeder, the Social Democratic leader who took over from Helmut Kohl as a result of the 1998 election. Under Schroeder, newly reunified Germany’s ambition to play a more autonomous role in world affairs reached its peak. In 2003, Berlin, Paris, and Moscow had even formed a new entente, as Russia’s then foreign minister Igor Ivanov called it, to oppose the U.S. invasion of Iraq and potentially act as a counterweight to Washington. The vision of a greater Europe from the Atlantic to the Pacific based on the marriage between the German/European industry and Russian resources was just about to take shape. Merkel, a former East German citizen, faced the need to be accepted by Germany’s largely Atlanticist political elite, as well as by Berlin’s principal allies in Washington. Mending strained ties with the United States became a priority for her, and she worked hard on it. Merkel succeeded, and in return, she got American support for Germany’s leading role in Europe, albeit within the general framework of U.S. global leadership. This did not mean Germany blindly following the United States at every turn: in 2008, Merkel refused to accept George W. Bush’s bid to include Ukraine and Georgia in NATO, and in 2010, Germany took no part in the NATO military operation in Libya, even abstaining at the relevant UN Security Council vote alongside China, India, and Russia. At the same time, Merkel did not allow the embarrassing public scandal over U.S. intelligence tapping her cell phone to get out of hand. During the Donald Trump years, Merkel — who did not get along too well with the forty-fifth U.S. president — rose to become the de facto temporary leader of the liberal West. That unanimous and apparently natural choice of the vast majority of European and American elites was recognition of the national prestige of both Merkel personally and Germany, and of their clear evocation of democratic values and the practice of liberal policies. Merkel’s informal tenure as leader of the West ended with the election of Joe Biden, but with Britain’s departure from the European Union following the 2016 referendum, Germany’s position as Washington’s principal ally within the EU had been elevated even higher. This is the main element of Angela Merkel’s legacy. When Merkel first became chancellor, Germany usually worked in tandem with France within the EU. Over time, Berlin rose to a position of preeminence, de facto making Paris its junior associate. During her tenure, Merkel worked with four French presidents: Jacques Chirac, Nicolas Sarkozy, François Hollande, and Emmanuel Macron. With every change of command at the Élysée Palace, the German chancellor appeared to stand taller. The appointment of her ally Ursula von der Leyen as president of the European Commission was a sign of the influence of both Germany and Merkel. To achieve that position, Germany had to manage major EU expansion, the debt crisis, and Brexit. Merkel did well on all three. Her only major failure was the immigration crisis of 2015, but once the negative consequences of the massive influx of migrants became apparent, she worked hard to stem the inflow and limit the damage. Berlin’s single leadership had to be accepted by its European partners, including those who were historically fearful of Berlin’s diktat. Particularly important in this regard were Germany’s eastern neighbors, Poland and the Baltic states, which were historically allergic to anything that might look like a reborn German Reich or any form of German-Russian collusion. To get their backing, Berlin had to take account of those countries’ special interests. It should be added, though, that German business gained much from the expansion of the EU to integrate Eastern European countries. Angela Merkel was the first German chancellor to speak Russian fluently, but this did not lead to a closer relationship with Moscow. In fact, the relationship grew markedly more distant, for several reasons. One was the reaffirmation of Germany’s Atlanticist credentials, even at a time when Russia’s relations with the United States were rapidly deteriorating. In 2007, Merkel was in the room in Munich when Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered his famous speech in which he lashed out at U.S. global hegemony. Another reason already alluded to was the enlargement of the European Union from 2004 to include a dozen former communist countries. This changed both the complexion of the EU and the balance within it. Many of the new entrants had had painful relations with the Soviet Union and the Russian Empire, or had even been part of the Russian realm in the past, and were still reeling from it. Berlin, which aspired to lead the expanding European Union, could not afford to ignore those sentiments. The EU’s enlargement also turned Eastern European countries into important trading partners and investment opportunities for Germany: far more so than the Russian Federation, which had long dominated Germany’s eastern trade. Finally, as the Cold War receded into the past, the division of Germany and Berlin was overcome, and the country’s physical security was assured, German society started to pay more attention to other issues, primarily environmental and climate-related, and social and political values, including human and minority rights. To the post–Cold War generation of German politicians, Russia was no longer the country that held the key to German reunification; nor were its forces a huge presence in East Germany; nor was it viewed as a land of economic opportunity in the east. Rather, post-Soviet Russia stood for a failing attempt at democratization, a grossly inefficient and primitive oligarchical economy, and an increasingly authoritarian regime led by a former KGB operative who used to work in East Germany. Angela Merkel’s personal relationship with Vladimir Putin was apparently decorous throughout, but never overly close. There was certainly no warmth there, unlike between Putin and Schroeder, or even Boris Yeltsin and Helmut Kohl. However, the German-Russian relationship initially moved forward with economic projects, political consultations, and high-level societal fora like the German-Russian Petersburg Dialogue. There was a moment in mid-2011 when Merkel publicly expressed her preference for Putin’s chosen interim successor, President Dmitry Medvedev. Like then U.S. president Barack Obama, the German chancellor saw Medvedev, in contrast to Putin, as a modernizer and a much more convenient partner for the West. At that time, Merkel and her then vice chancellor and foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier were promoting a modernization partnership with Russia in the hope that modernization would not be limited to technology and the economy — in line with Putin’s idea of a Greater Europe from Lisbon to Vladivostok, which he laid out before the German business community during a 2010 visit — but would also transform the Russian political system and society according to the Western model. In that respect, Berlin’s expectations turned out to be wishful thinking. Major disappointment set in as Putin decided to run for the Russian presidency again. The last seven-plus years of Merkel’s involvement with the Kremlin were marked and marred by the Ukraine crisis, Crimea, and the armed conflict in Donbas. As a result, the post–Cold War German-Russian partnership degenerated into a transactional relationship with increasing mutual criticism and decreasing trust. In Putin’s eyes, Berlin’s connivance with Paris and Warsaw over what the Kremlin regarded as the Maidan coup in Kyiv that toppled the elected president amounted to a massive breach of trust. In turn, Russia’s forceful reaction to the developments in Ukraine stunned Merkel and her colleagues. In vain did Putin appeal to German gratitude for Moscow having turned the key on reunification; Merkel, reflecting the views of not only the German political class, but also much of the public, saw Russia’s actions as changing borders by force and thus upsetting the post–Cold War order in Europe. Merkel took the lead in imposing rafts of EU sanctions on Russia. Unlike other Western leaders, however, Merkel did not respond to the crisis by severing all contact with Moscow in an attempt to “isolate” and thus “punish” Russia. The German chancellor, while being very critical of Russian policies, kept the line of communication to the Kremlin open. In February 2015, Merkel put at stake her own prestige by flying to Minsk for marathon negotiations to broker a ceasefire in Donbas. Since then, much of her interaction with Putin has been devoted to the conflict in Ukraine’s southeast. Her approach could be described as critical dialogue, with both sides trading critical arguments, but also looking for ways and means of managing the standoff. Germany’s critical public attitude toward Russia was not limited to Ukraine-related issues. Starting with the campaign focusing on the “values gap” with Russia and the thrashing of Germany’s own so-called Putin-Versteher, or Putin-empathizers, the criticism was becoming wider and more scathing. Accusations of Russian media meddling in German politics, of Russia’s involvement in the Bundestag hacking, and the murder of a former Chechen rebel commander in Berlin’s central Tiergarten marked a clear downward trend in the relationship. In 2020, Merkel publicly supported a German military laboratory’s findings that Russian anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny, who had been flown from Russia to Germany for emergency medical treatment, had been poisoned with a chemical nerve agent. Merkel herself visited the activist in a Berlin hospital. Symbolically, the Navalny incident closed the book on what had remained of the three-decades-long German-Russian partnership. The partnership may be in the past, but the relationship continues. In 2021, Merkel passed an important test in defending German interests from U.S. pressure. Despite the strained relations with Russia and vehement criticism from the EU’s eastern flank countries such as Poland and the Baltic states, not to mention hysterics from Ukraine, Merkel succeeded in reaching a deal with U.S. President Joe Biden on allowing the completion of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia under the Baltic Sea. Merkel’s unfailing consistency and stubborn determination under enormous pressure, which eventually led to a positive outcome for Germany, was closely watched and appreciated by the Kremlin. It was also appreciated that before leaving office, she made one last visit to Russia. Seen from Moscow, Angela Merkel’s long tenure was a period of relative, if not always palatable, predictability in German-Russian relations. Vladimir Putin often disagreed with the German chancellor, but he undoubtedly respected her. For Russian policymakers, Germany remains the European Union’s key member state. Historically, Moscow’s relations with the major powers have heavily depended on its interaction with the leaders of those powers. The future of the relationship will depend in no small measure on who succeeds her and how skilled that successor is at the art of statecraft. Merkel is leaving behind very big shoes to fill.

After almost all precincts were counted, the ruling Georgian Dream party led with 46.6% of the votes in Saturday's elections, while all of the opposition parties combined garnered 53.4%, official results showed. Critics have denounced a backsliding on democracy in Georgia, saying parliamentary elections held last October were rigged and accusing the ruling party of using criminal prosecutions to punish political opponents and journalists. Under an EU-brokered inter-party agreement in May, Georgian Dream had pledged to hold snap parliamentary elections if it won less than 43% of the municipal vote. But it unilaterally withdrew from the pact in July, sparking harsh criticism from the West, and Saturday's result frees them from the obligation to call snap polls. Georgian Dream said in a statement that the closely-watched elections ""were held at the highest democratic standards."" But opposition parties said Sunday widespread irregularities undermined the credibility of the elections, held in a tense atmosphere after Saakashvili, the country's foremost opposition leader and former president, was arrested on return from exile. ""The election results were falsified. We have witnessed intimidation and bribing of voters prior to the elections, multiple voting on the election day,"" Giorgi Baramidze, a leader of Saakashvili's United National Movement (UNM), told AFP. ""The elections' credibility has already been undermined by the fact that the leader of the opposition was first forced into exile and then arrested,"" he said referring to Saakashvili. ""We will use all the legal means to reverse the falsification."" Badri Japaridze, a leader of opposition Lelo party, said: ""The elections were marred by large-scale intimidation and bribing of voters, seriously affecting the electoral results."" In a number of major cities — including the capital Tbilisi — second round runoffs will have to be held on October 30 between mayoral candidates from the Georgian Dream and the UNM, the country's main opposition force. Saakashvili, 53, secretly returned to Georgia on Friday from Ukraine — where he heads a government agency steering reforms — ahead of the elections and was quickly detained for alleged abuse of office. The flamboyant pro-Western reformer and president in 2004-2013, denied any wrongdoing, denounced a six-year jail sentence in absentia as politically motivated and went on hunger strike following his arrest. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday he will be pressing for Saakashvili's return to Ukraine as he is a Ukrainian national and was stripped of his Georgian passport. Saakashvili's jailing aggravated the political crisis that engulfed Georgia last October when opposition parties denounced parliamentary elections as rigged, refused to take up their seats in the newly elected legislature and staged mass protests to demand snap polls. Prior to his arrest, Saakashvili had called on supporters to take to the streets ""to protect election results."" But opposition parties have so far refrained from staging protests, awaiting the conclusions from international monitors who are due to present their assessment later on Sunday. The United States has hinted at possible sanctions against Georgian officials over the country's backsliding on democracy. In comments to AFP through a representative, who visited him in prison on Saturday, Saakashvili said he returned to Georgia despite looming arrest ""to fight to the end against the oligarchic rule which kills Georgian democracy."" He was referring to former prime minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, a powerful oligarch and ruling party founder who is widely believed to be calling the shots in Georgia despite holding no political office.",1,589,97.63,57.28,17.98,1,26.77,37.52,79.63,52.29,41.26,4.07,3.06,0,0.34,0,1.7,0.51,1.02,12.05,9.17,1.53,16.47,4.92,1.7,5.09,0.17,11.21,4.58,2.04,14.94,1.87,0.51,12.73,6.96,0.68,6.28,0.51,2.21,0,1.02,0.17,2.21,0,5.94,1.19,4.75,0.34,0,0.34,0.17,0.17,0,0,12.39,7.3,0,0,3.06,0.68,2.04,4.92,0,0,0,1.7,9.85,9.51,0.34,0,2.89,1.02,0,1.87,0,0,0.51,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.17,0.17,0.85,0,0.34,0.17,0,0,0.17,0.68,0,2.21,6.28,0,1.02,5.6,0.17,0,0.17,5.43,7.81,1.19,1.36,0,0,0,0,0,15.79,4.07,5.09,0,0,1.87,4.75

Russia's population has been in near-constant decline since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, due to a low birth rate, an under-resourced healthcare system, and emigration. The coronavirus pandemic, which has killed at least 400,000 people in Russia according to the national statistic agency Rosstat, has seriously aggravated the problem. In 2020, the population shrank by 510,000 people — the sharpest decline in 15 years, Rosstat calculated. It found that the population, which numbered 146.2 million as of January 1, declined by another 595,000 people by the end of August. Russia has also seen its birth rate stagnate as the mortality rate spikes, Rosstat data shows. The country is seeing falling birth rates because the generation becoming parents now were born in the 1990s, when the birthrate fell drastically due to economic uncertainties. President Vladimir Putin, who has pointed to poverty as a key factor in limiting family size, has over the years announced a litany of financial incentives to encourage Russians to have more children to boost the population. The census comes as Russia is seeing a surge in coronavirus infections. This week the country set a pandemic high for both cases and deaths as Russia's jab drive stalls and a lack of strict restrictions allow the virus to spread unchecked. To help limit the spread, much of the census will be conducted online, while workers will be regularly tested for the virus, Rosstat said. Russia has conducted two previous census counts since the fall of the Soviet Union, in 2010 and 2002. One of the only times Russia's population has grown in the years since the Soviet collapse was in 2014, when Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine, adding more than 2.5 million people. The census will run until November 14 and preliminary population figures are expected in April.",1,323,97.45,41.89,66.28,5.16,23.07,26.93,81.11,54.18,43.65,2.79,0.31,0,0,0,0,0,2.48,16.41,11.76,5.57,15.17,6.5,2.17,6.19,0,10.53,3.41,8.67,4.95,1.55,0.31,3.1,6.19,0.62,5.26,0.93,1.55,0.31,0.31,0.31,1.24,0,3.1,0.62,2.48,0.31,0,0.31,0,0.31,0,0,3.72,1.55,0.62,0,0.31,0,0.31,1.55,0.31,0,0,0,3.72,2.17,1.24,0.31,1.86,0,0,0.93,0.93,0,3.72,2.79,2.79,0,0,0,0,0,0.93,0.31,0,0,0.62,0,0,0.31,0.31,0,4.02,9.6,0,2.48,7.74,0.93,0,0,8.36,3.72,4.64,1.24,0,0,0,0,0,13.62,4.95,6.81,0,0,1.24,0.62

Chupik, an Uzbek activist who had held asylum in Russia since 2009, was detained at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport last month, with FSB officers telling her that her refugee status was revoked for alleged “document falsification” and that she is banned from entering Russia for 30 years. She has called the move “absolute nonsense” and expressed fears she could be jailed, tortured or killed if she were repatriated to Uzbekistan. “I am currently in Armenia in a beautiful spot just on the outskirts of Yerevan,” Chupik told The Moscow Times via WhatsApp. Last week, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Chupik’s deportation to Uzbekistan should be suspended, applying Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, which is applied as an urgent measure in cases where there is an imminent risk of causing irreparable harm. Russian law enforcement had also searched the apartment of Chupik’s 84-year-old mother two days after her detention. Chupik and her mother have now applied for asylum in Ukraine and are currently awaiting a response from the Ukrainian authorities, her aides have said. Chupik, 48, fled ex-Soviet Uzbekistan in 2005 following a bloody crackdown on protesters in the city of Andijan, claiming she was tortured by Uzbek special services. In Moscow, Chupik founded the Tong Jahoni (Morning of the World) NGO which provides free legal services to migrants who have faced pressure from law enforcement agencies. Each year, hundreds of thousands of migrant workers travel to Russia from former Soviet republics, mainly those in Central Asia, in search of better wages. Many face discrimination and abuse from Russian citizens and authorities. But since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, Russia has seen a mass outflow of migrant workers, triggering efforts to tackle an emerging labor shortage in industries like construction and agriculture. Earlier this year, Russia handed a 40-year entry ban to Tajikistan-born opposition activist Saidanvar Sulaimonov in what he called retaliation for his work on a Kremlin critic’s campaign for last month’s parliamentary election.",1,353,93.47,65.13,12.93,5.91,27.15,30.88,77.9,52.41,41.93,6.8,4.53,0.28,0,0,3.68,0,2.27,11.33,6.8,3.12,15.86,5.95,2.27,4.25,0,10.76,3.68,2.83,8.78,0.57,1.13,7.08,4.25,0,4.25,0,1.7,0.57,0.85,0,1.7,0,3.4,0.85,2.55,0.85,0,0.85,0.28,0,0,0.28,11.9,5.1,0,0,1.7,0.57,2.27,6.52,0.57,0,3.68,0.57,5.38,2.55,2.55,0.28,3.68,0,0.28,3.4,0.28,0,1.13,0.57,0.57,0,0,0,0,0,0.28,0.28,0,0,0.28,0,0,0,1.13,0,3.97,8.5,0.57,1.98,5.67,0.28,0,0,6.52,5.38,3.4,0.28,0.28,0.28,0,0,0,14.73,3.68,5.67,0,0,1.42,3.97

Not weaponizing football hooligans or COVID vaccines this time, but apparently gas. From U.S National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan to British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, politicians are queuing up to blame Russia for the current global gas crisis. The trouble is that not only is this bad analysis, it is also bad politics. The economics As has been documented, the current gas crisis has numerous causes, which have combined in a singularly problematic way. A year of coronavirus (COVID-19) which saw reserves scaled down in a “gas glut”; a hard winter and a hot summer, both of which meant greater consumption; accidents interrupting supply lines. All this is exacerbated by a heightened demand from Asia, which is essentially monopolizing the liquid natural gas (LNG) which otherwise represents the fungible supply often relied on to make up for shortfalls in piped gas. And, of course, European buyers who had not wanted to commit themselves to long-term contracts as a result ended up paying spot prices. But where does Russia fit? Moscow has been fulfilling its contract commitments and, far from somehow “choking off” the gas as British sources have been claiming, is supplying close to record levels. Of course, Gazprom will be looking to maximise its profits, just as the Kremlin is inevitably trying to use the situation to push German regulators into giving the final OK to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. The morality What, though, is the sin here? First of all, Russia has no moral duty to provide more gas whenever the West wants it. So long as they observe their contractual obligations, the rest is simple market economics. To be sure, it would be very convenient for everyone else if Moscow were willing and able to increase the supply, but considering the continued grip of Western sanctions on Russia, as well as the barrage of sanctimonious critiques (which, to be fair, it is not that the current regime doesn’t deserve, but which are not levelled against other regimes which may deserve it even more), should we expect Putin to go out of his way to do us a favour? Are the U.S. and Qatari LNG suppliers who eagerly pivoted to service the seemingly insatiable Asian market also being castigated as malign market manipulators and profiteers? The question is naturally rhetorical: of course not. Besides, how far could Putin help, so long as Nord Stream 2 remains locked in regulatory limbo? It is clear that there is more capacity in the pipelines which cross Ukraine. However, Moscow is understandably reluctant to pay Kiev more transit fees. More to the point, those pipelines largely connect to legacy gas fields in the Nadym-Pur-Taz (NPT) region in West Siberia, whose capacity is in decline and which must prioritise local needs. Nord Stream 1 and 2 are fed by the new Yamal fields, but with the latter pipeline still closed, then the Russians are constrained in how much extra supply they could provide. Although there are interconnectors between the systems, even if Moscow wanted to send Yamal gas through the Central Route across Ukraine, it is unclear if they could, given that these capillaries are being used for domestic supply. In other words, it’s complex. The politics But no problem is ever so complex that politicians cannot distil it into banal simplifications and crude rhetoric. Especially when public opinion is becoming increasingly demanding, a scapegoat is always a good distraction, and these days there is no scapegoat better than a Russian one. (A scapebear?) There seem to be three main reasons for the unusually crude “analysis” being deployed over the gas crisis, each of which has a particularly problematic impact on policy, which is why this is more than just a jeremiad against crass Western political headline-chasing. Nonetheless, that lazy and self-interested search for an external excuse is certainly one of those factors. The particular problem with lazy explanations is that they often lead to lazy — and that means expensive and/or fruitless — policy responses. Talk of creating a European strategic gas reserve, for example, would be expensive and politically complex, and take years, all of which mean it would have no impact on the current situation. However, it can get much more political traction by being securitised, presented as a way of “defending” Europe against Putin's “energy weapon.” The second is that the Nord Stream 2 issue has become about much more than the pipeline but a tribal divide over the place of Russia in the world. Whether or not some of the pipelines' foes were also motivated by interests in LNG, whether selling it or receiving it, this has assumed a significance out of all proportion to the actual pipeline. Those who claim that it would somehow make Europe more dependent on Russia's “energy weapon” fail to explain quite how. Yes, it would allow Gazprom to send as little as it could through the Ukrainian pipes and thus minimize payments to Kiev, which is undoubtedly (and no doubt intentionally) bad for the Ukrainians, but it would hardly affect how much Russian gas Europe consumes. If anything, it might actually increase the EU's energy security. Although the days of Moscow turning off the gas are likely gone – the Russians cannot afford to go without the income — when Europe has suffered in the past, it was essentially as collateral, caught by the Kremlin's dispute with Kiev. Yet while Putin might be willing to play hardball with Ukraine, he would likely think twice before trying to do the same with Germany. It is worth noting that Angela Markel has been very bullish that further sanctions would result from any Russian efforts to “weaponize” the pipeline. Thus an essentially emotional campaign against Nord Stream 2 limits Europe's energy options and keeps prices high, in a last-ditch bid to punish Gazprom and the Kremlin (and, implicitly, Germany). Quite who is weaponising gas here? Thirdly, the easy assumption that whenever Russia is involved “hybrid war” and “malign influence” come in its wake, while understandable, always risks spiralling into a vicious circle. Touchy, acutely aware of its relative weaknesses and forever seeing subtle plots in Western blunders, the Kremlin tends to respond badly to overheated political rhetoric. One of the great virtues of Joe Biden's handling of Putin at the Geneva summit was to keep the tough talking to the private session, while treating Russia with respect in public. This may sound trivial, but policies are decided by people, and the ageing lords of the Kremlin take language seriously. Meanwhile, the risk is that at home, such rhetoric locks Western governments into futile and counter-productive gestures. Already I am aware of at least a couple of European foreign ministries brainstorming how to “punish Moscow for creating the gas crisis” just in case their political masters demand it. I asked one of those involved if the team actually believed Russia was to blame. Of course not, came the reply, but you know how politicians are… The wicked problem None of this is to exonerate Moscow for all the destructive and antagonistic things it does do, from poisonings in Britain to trolling in the infosphere. Indeed, to a considerable extent, it is simply reaping the fruits of years of such activities, such that too many, too easily believe too much that goes wrong is somehow down to Russia's unseen and unfriendly hand. However, there are many — analysts, experts, policymakers — who do know better or should know better. In many ways, the gas crisis is a fitting metaphor for the challenges of the modern world: complex, global, hard to fix and likely to have long and unpredictable impacts. The policies of particular countries may exacerbate it a little here, alleviate a little there. Certainly were Germany to approve Nord Stream 2 and other countries then buy gas from Russia — especially on the longer-term contracts it craves — that would help. It wouldn’t magically make the underlying issues disappear, though. The answer to problems of wicked complexity is not to pretend they are simple, not to look for a “usual suspect” to blame. It is to look for solutions of appropriate complexity. At present, for the West, this looks like a fail.

""The decision to withdraw the accreditation of eight members of the Russian delegation to NATO was done based on intelligence because these are undeclared Russian intelligence officers,"" Stoltenberg said. ""We have seen an increase in Russian malign activities, at least in Europe and therefore we need to act."" The NATO chief said that the decision to kick out the Russian representatives was not ""linked to any particular event"" — but gave no more details over the move. NATO announced Wednesday it had decided to strip the ""undeclared Russian intelligence officers"" of official accreditation to the alliance and halve the size of the Russian delegation to 10. Stoltenberg reiterated that the ""relationship between NATO and Russia is at its lowest point since the end of the Cold War. And that's because of the Russian behavior."" Ties between the West and Moscow have slumped in recent years since the Kremlin's 2014 annexation of Crimea and over its involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Russia has long had an observer mission to NATO as part of a two-decade-old NATO-Russia Council meant to promote cooperation in common security areas, but it is not a member of the U.S.-led Alliance. The Kremlin said earlier Thursday that the expulsions showed NATO members have no desire to normalise relations with Moscow. ""There is an obvious contradiction in the statements of NATO representatives about the desire to normalise relations with our country and in real actions,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. The Russian mission has been downsized once before, when seven of its members were ejected after the 2018 poisoning by the Novichok nerve agent on a Russian former double agent, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter in Britain. Accreditation applications by another three Russian diplomats were denied. Meetings of a NATO-Russia council have not been held since 2019 against the backdrop of the heightened tensions. ""We are ready to engage in meaningful dialogue with with Russia, and we are ready also to convene a NATO-Russia Council meeting,"" Stoltenberg said. ""We have actually invited Russia for a long time. So far, Russia has not responded positively."" Sky News reported that NATO's decision came after information was revealed in April about fatal explosions at a Czech ammunition depot in 2014 that Prague says involved two Russian spies — identified as allegedly implicated in the Skripal poisoning. That Czech Republic-Russia incident led to the mutual expulsion of dozens of EU and Russian diplomats and other embassy staff.",1,433,95.95,57.95,34.57,12.9,22.79,32.79,82.22,57.51,46.19,4.85,1.62,0,1.39,0,0.23,0,3.23,15.47,9.47,2.54,17.55,6,2.08,6.24,1.39,11.32,5.54,3.7,7.62,4.16,0.23,3.23,10.62,0.46,10.16,2.31,2.31,0.69,0.69,0.92,3,0,3.93,1.39,2.08,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.55,5.08,1.15,0,0.23,0,3,6,0.23,0,0.23,0.46,8.08,4.62,3.46,0,4.39,0,0,4.39,0,0,0.92,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.23,0.69,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,0.23,0,3.7,8.78,0,1.15,6,0.92,0.23,0.46,4.39,7.39,2.54,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,13.86,4.85,2.31,0,0,0.92,5.77

This is Novaya Gazeta's,” Muratov said after the Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded him and prominent journalist from the Philippines, Maria Ressa, the 2021 Peace Prize. Established in 1993, Novaya Gazeta gained a reputation for hard-hitting journalism on topics including the 2014 downing of flight MH17 and the 2016 Panama Papers leaks into offshore dealings. The paper continued its intrepid work despite the killings of six of its journalists, most notably Anna Politkovskaya in 2006, and threats and harassment of its reporters over the years. Here’s a look at some of Novaya Gazeta’s major investigative reports in recent years, both under Muratov's leadership and otherwise: Chechen anti-LGBT campaign, 2017 and 2019 Novaya Gazeta broke the news in 2017 on the alleged torture and killings of people in southern Russia’s republic of Chechnya who are suspected of being gay. Its reporting has raised international awareness of Chechnya’s alleged anti-gay purges, leading to international legal action brought outside Russian borders. Western-sanctioned Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has denied Novaya Gazeta’s reports of a broad crackdown on LGBT members, claiming that only heterosexuals live in his deeply conservative majority-Muslim region. Extrajudicial killings, 2021 Chechen security officers had also rounded up civilians and summarily executed them in sweeping anti-terror raids around the same time as the gay purges of 2017, Novaya Gazeta reported this year, citing an ex-policeman’s testimony. That report prompted officials in Chechnya, which Kadyrov has ruled with a degree of autonomy in exchange for loyalty to Moscow following two devastating separatist wars in the 1990s, to call for Novaya Gazeta’s closure. Syria mercenary beheading, 2019 Novaya Gazeta linked Russian mercenaries to the gruesome beheading, dismembering and immolation of a Syrian detainee in 2017. The publication withheld the identities of the fighters, believed to be mercenaries for Kremlin-linked private military contractor the Wagner Group, but said it stood ready to provide its materials to Russian law enforcement if they wanted to investigate the torture. The Kremlin has said the footage of the cold-blooded beheading had nothing to do with Russia’s military operations in Syria. Private military companies are illegal in Russia — a technicality that the Kremlin has used to deny Wagner’s reported presence in Syria, Ukraine, Libya, Sudan and other conflict-torn countries. Contract killings, 2018 Novaya Gazeta linked contract killings and attacks on Russian opposition activists and bloggers to U.S.-sanctioned catering magnate Yevgeny Prigozhin, who western journalists have linked to Wagner. The article, which cited interviews with a former Prigozhin associate who has since disappeared, was published days after unknown individuals sent its author, Novaya Gazeta reporter Denis Korotkov, a funeral wreath and a severed goat’s head. Prison torture, 2018 and 2019 Novaya Gazeta finally succeeded in triggering an investigation and a nationwide inspection after it published body cam footage from 2016-17 of prison guards torturing an inmate in the city of Yaroslavl northeast of Moscow. After the shocking footage put a national spotlight on the issue of prisoner abuse in Russia, the publication followed up with new videos of abuse two years later.",1,536,97.64,41.18,26.98,1.19,29.78,35.82,74.07,47.76,38.25,4.66,1.68,0.19,0,0,0.56,0.37,2.99,12.13,8.21,4.1,16.04,3.54,1.12,4.85,0.37,7.65,4.85,2.61,8.96,0.56,1.68,6.72,5.41,0.19,5.22,1.49,0.75,0.37,0.75,0,2.24,0,6.53,1.49,4.85,0.93,0,0.75,0,0,0,0,8.77,5.6,0.19,0,3.17,0,1.31,2.99,0,0,0,0.56,2.8,1.31,1.31,0.19,6.16,0,0.19,5.6,0.37,0,2.99,0,0,0,0,0,0.75,0,1.68,0,0.19,0.37,0,0,0,1.31,0.56,0,1.68,9.14,0.56,1.12,7.46,0.19,0,0,3.17,3.73,2.43,0.37,0,0,0,0,0,15.3,3.73,5.97,0,0,2.43,3.17

Long derided as a gastronomic wasteland, Russia's restaurant scene has emerged in recent years from a post-Soviet reputation for blandness, with establishments in Moscow regularly making lists of some of the world's best. Representatives of the Michelin guide — considered the international standard of restaurant rankings — released the first Moscow edition of their iconic red book at a ceremony at Moscow. Sixty-nine restaurants were recommended in all. Two restaurants — Twins Garden run by twin brothers Ivan and Sergei Berezutskiy, and chef Artem Estafev's Artest — were given two stars. Seven restaurants were given one star, including White Rabbit, whose chef Vladimir Mukhin featured in an episode of the Netflix documentary series ""Chef's Table."" None were given three stars — the Holy Grail of the restaurant world. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said at the ceremony that the release of the guide was an important event at a tough time for the restaurant industry. ""It's big moral support in this time of pandemic, when restaurants are having a particularly difficult time,"" he said. Sobyanin said it also showed Russia had rediscovered a food tradition that had suffered under the Soviet Union. ""Unfortunately during the Soviet period these traditions were lost,"" he said. ""I am proud that Moscow's restaurants have become a calling card for our fantastic city."" Michelin's international director Gwendal Poullennec told a press conference that the guide had used an international team of inspectors for its list and there was ""no compromise in our methodology."" Speaking to AFP earlier, he said Russia's food scene had been ""reinventing"" itself since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union. ""There is an evolution of the Russian culinary scene. It is more and more dynamic,"" Poullennec said. He said he was surprised by ""the quality and abundance of produce"" in Moscow restaurants, highlighting in particular the seafood, such as crab and caviar, that are ""exclusive"" elsewhere but in Russia are available at a ""reasonable price."" Russia became the 35th country to have a Michelin guide and Moscow is the first city of the former Soviet Union to be awarded stars. The selection of restaurants will appear in print and also be available via an app in 25 languages, including Russian. Michelin in December said that chefs in Moscow had set themselves apart by highlighting Russian ingredients, including king crab from the Far Eastern city of Vladivostok and smetana, the sour cream used in preparing beef stroganoff. Moscow restaurants have increasingly turned to local ingredients after Western sanctions following Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 resulted in a scarcity of many European foods. A number of restaurants that relied on meat, cheese and fish imported from the West were forced to close, while those that strived to source their ingredients from Russian regions became more competitive. In explaining why it chose Moscow, the guide last year pointed to the ""unique flavors"" of the ""nation's emblematic first courses such as borscht."" Another leading French restaurant guide, Gault et Millau, launched its first Russian edition in 2017. In 2019, Gault & Millau was sold to Russian investors. Twins Garden and White Rabbit have previously featured on the World's 50 Best Restaurants list.

The Pandora Papers, a trove of almost 12 million documents, have shined a light on the activities of over 330 politicians and public officials in more than 90 countries and territories. According to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, Russian nationals are “disproportionately represented,” accounting for 14% of the more than 27,000 named companies. The news is at once dramatic, predictable, and ⁠— alas ⁠— arguably pointless. This no doubt sounds deeply churlish, an offense to the 600-plus journalists from 150 different news outlets including Russia's iStories, who dug into the data for two years, connecting the dots and uncovering the faces behind the anonymous offshore shell companies. The Papers will, one can hope, provide further impetus for efforts in the West to bring meaningful transparency to what is, for all the ritual declarations of politicians, bankers and regulators, still a financial system that offers numerous opportunities for legal avoidance of tax and scrutiny to those able to afford the right lawyers and accountants. The way former British prime minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie sidestepped paying $423,000 property tax by buying a $8,75m building in a posh London neighborhood through an offshore company based in the British Virgin Islands has certainly provided a new focus for criticism both of the couple, but also this particular legal loophole. The Russian Response When it comes to Russia, while a cast of the high and the mighty appear, inevitably media attention has focused on anything that can be linked with Putin, notably allegations about the family of a reputed former girlfriend. That reflects Western media obsessions as much as anything else. But does it really matter?  First of all, the news can be mobilized for political purposes in other ways, too. The relatively innocuous discovery that before his election, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy moved millions of dollars assets into a network of offshores, in collaboration with his aid Serhiy Shefir and present security service chief Ivan Bakanov, has been pounced on with glee not just by his political enemies but also the Russian media. Given his carefully cultivated image as the one honest man in Ukrainian politics, the impression of impropriety ⁠— even if everything he did was legal ⁠— is a problem. Secondly, the very scale of the revelations dilutes their impact by contributing to the sense ⁠— not entirely inaccurate ⁠— that everyone with power and money is much the same. That said, Beijing’s magnates and politicians are surprisingly absent, not least given the ample evidence there is of systemic corruption in China. Likewise, there is a dearth of Americans, and the notion that they never abuse financial loopholes does rather stretch credulity. No wonder that Russian sources also rush to portray this as a strategic leak by the US intelligence community intended to undermine the Kremlin. It has to be said, though, that this would seem to be a rather scattershot and slow-motion attack. Would Washington really also embarrass so many allies in the quest to air some dirty Russian laundry? In any case, while individuals may be turning to their lawyers and PR consultants, how much real impact will this have? The sorry truth would seem to be that by now no one is either surprised nor mobilized by these kind of revelations. Do any Russians really presume that these people weren't fiddling the books? Will it comes as a shock that, for example, Sergei Chemezov, CEO of Russian state defence conglomerate Rostec, has a superyacht registered through an offshore? They are probably more surprised that he does not moor it at a secret Pacific island hideaway populated by genetically-engineered unicorns. The Navalny dilemma This is not just about the Pandora Papers, although they do seem to demonstrate that more is not always better, it also speaks to a fundamental political challenge facing Team Navalny.  Their 'He's not Dimon to you' video had the virtue of dismantling Dmitry Medvedev's reputation as being one of the few honest figures in the regime. 'Putin's Palace' was not just their first direct attack on the monarch, it had a voyeuristic “cribs of the rich and famous” dimension. I suspect many watched not for the forensic analysis of the financing but the pole-dance hookah bar. Where do you, can you, go from there? It is all very well going after Sergei Lavrov, and other boyars, but there is surely a law of diminishing returns. Once there is a general assumption that everyone is a crook and a thief, then further revelations may enthuse your base, but are hardly likely to expand it. As pollsters put it, that is already 'priced in' to people's political decision-making. A lot of journalists can justly congratulate themselves on some serious work. Hopefully, campaigners will be able to use the latest revelations to push for serious regulatory changes. But for Russia, the likelihood that this is a one-week wonder, at best.

Footage published on the Ukrainian armed forces’ Facebook page showed the Bayraktar TB2k targeting and shooting a Soviet-era howitzer it identified as the pro-Russian forces’ D-30. The Ukrainian armed forces accused the separatists of wounding one soldier and killing another with the D-30 near the eastern town of Hranitne on the front line. “Bayraktar was used in order to force the enemy to cease fire,” the Ukrainian armed forces’ general staff said in a statement. “After that, the shelling of Ukrainian positions stopped.” The drone strike did not inflict any military or civilian casualties, Russia’s Interfax news agency quoted an unnamed source in the self-proclaimed, separatist-held Donetsk People’s Republic as saying Wednesday. The neighboring separatist-held Luhansk People’s Republic accused Kiev of using the Bayraktar in violation of ceasefire agreements that ban the deployment of foreign drones on the front line. Tuesday’s drone strike is the first since Turkey delivered the first batch of Bayraktar TB2 to Ukraine in July. The Turkish private company Baykar, which produces the armed drones, describes the TB2 model as a ""medium altitude long endurance tactical unmanned aerial vehicle capable of conducting intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and armed attack missions"" with a range of up to 27 hours. Media reports said Kiev plans to buy around 50 Bayraktar TB2 drones, a flagship model that has been used in conflicts against Russian proxies in Syria, Libya and the Nagorno-Karabakh region at the center of a decades-long dispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Ukraine and Turkey signed a memorandum in late September to establish a joint training and maintenance center for the drones in Ukraine. This month, Ukraine’s foreign minister said it plans to build a factory to produce Bayraktar drones in the country. The sale of drones to Kiev places Ankara in a delicate position, as Turkey also cooperates in the defense sector with Russia, Ukraine's rival. The Kremlin said Wednesday that Turkey’s supply of drones to Ukraine risks destabilizing the eastern Ukraine conflict despite Moscow’s “special” relations with Ankara. The Ukrainian army has been locked in a long-running conflict with separatist fighters in Donetsk and Luhansk since 2014 after Moscow annexed the peninsula of Crimea from Kiev. The conflict has claimed more than 13,000 lives. Ukraine and its Western allies accuse Russia of sending troops and arms to support the separatists, which Moscow denies.

Both Moscow and Kiev claimed ownership of the Scythian treasures dating back to the 2nd century B.C., which were loaned to Amsterdam’s Allard Pierson Museum. The museum’s “Crimea: Gold and Secrets of the Black Sea” exhibit opened in February 2014, one month before Russia seized the Black Sea peninsula from Ukraine. The Amsterdam Court of Appeal sided with Kiev and ruled that the collection of more than 2,000 items should be returned to Ukraine, the Dutch broadcaster NOS reported. “Although the objects originate in Crimea,” the judge said, according to a video posted by Russia’s state-run RIA Novosti news agency, “they are part of Ukraine’s heritage after it became independent in 1991.” According to RIA Novosti, the judge said her ruling is subject to appeal with the Netherlands’ supreme court. A lawyer for the Russian-held Crimean museums told RIA Novosti they have three months to appeal the ruling, in which case deliberations could last another year. Russian lawmakers and Crimean museum directors were quick to condemn the Dutch court ruling, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy vowed to “return Crimea” like it did the Scythian gold. Four Crimean museums launched a joint legal bid seven years ago to force the Allard Pierson Museum to return the historic collection of archaeological artefacts dubbed the ""Scythian Gold"" to the peninsula. The impressive collection spans the 2nd century BC to the late medieval era, when Crimea was at the crossroads of ancient trade routes through an area dominated by the Scythian people. A lower court said in 2016 that the treasures were part of Ukraine's cultural heritage and must be returned instead to Kiev, adding that Crimea was not considered a sovereign state. The Crimean museums appealed against the judgement, saying the artifacts belonged there, and the Dutch court of appeal said in 2019 that it needed more time to decide on the matter. The treasures themselves have remained in ""safe storage"" in the Allard Pierson museum, which is the archaeological museum of the University of Amsterdam, pending the appeal.

The country of 2.6 million people wedged between Romania and Ukraine gets gas from Russia via its pro-Russian separatist region of Transnistria and Ukraine. Gazprom has hiked prices from $550 per thousand cubic meters last month to $790 this month – a level Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Spinu said was ""not justified and not realistic"" for Europe's poorest country. ""We face a critical situation,"" Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita said Friday. She told parliament Moldova would be seeking supplies from EU countries and thanked Romania and Ukraine for already supplying some gas. While Gazprom and its daughter company Moldovagaz last month agreed to extend their existing contract for supplies until Oct. 31, Gavrilita said Moldovagaz ""is not keeping its word."" The company is not providing the required volumes of natural gas, she said, with Moldova receiving a third less than usual for October. The prime minister said Moldova and Gazprom were continuing negotiations but that the ex-Soviet country has ""no confidence"" in the success of the talks and ""must take action"" or be ""left without gas."" The month-long state of emergency gives Moldovan utility company Energocom the power to secure gas from other countries. The country's gas shortages come amid skyrocketing gas prices that some in Europe have blamed on Moscow not providing additional supplies to put pressure on the continent. Some experts say Russia has boosted prices as pressure on Moldova for electing a pro-European president in Maia Sandu last year, who has said she wants to fold the breakaway region of Transnistria back into Moldova.

Defense Chief Heads to Black Sea Region",English,Russia,"U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin headed to the Black Sea region Sunday aiming to shore up alliances with countries pressured by Russia and show gratitude for their contributions to the two-decade war in Afghanistan. Austin will visit Georgia, Romania and Ukraine before taking part in the in-person defense ministers summit at NATO in Brussels on October 21-22. ""We are reassuring and reinforcing the sovereignty of countries that are on the front lines of Russian aggression,"" a senior U.S. defense official told reporters ahead of the trip. All three countries are in the NATO orbit — Romania a full member and Georgia and Ukraine partner states. All three also sit on the rim of the Black Sea, where Russia has sought to expand its own influence and prevent expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the US-European alliance. Russia has occupied Ukraine's Crimea and has troops stationed in Georgia's breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. And Kiev is battling pro-Russian separatists in the country's east, in a conflict that has cost 13,000 lives. In June Russian forces menaced Dutch and British warships as they sailed near Crimea. Austin will also extend thanks to its partners for their contributions, and significant losses, as part of coalition forces in Afghanistan over two decades, before the hasty U.S. exit this year that ceded the country to the Taliban. ""We are going to be showing recognition and appreciation for the sacrifices and the commitments of our partners and allies,"" the official said. In Georgia, Austin will meet with Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili and Minister of Defense Juansher Burchuladze, with a key aim to keep up defense cooperation as a three-year U.S. Army training program expires this year. Georgia hopes Austin's visit will help advance its case for becoming a full NATO member. It will be ""another clear message from the U.S. in support of Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, its stable and democratic development, and for the country's Euro-Atlantic goals"" Foreign Minister David Zalkaliani said Wednesday. ""We expect that meetings will be focused on further deepening our cooperation, regional security issues, and the process of Georgia's NATO integration,"" he said. In Ukraine, Austin will have talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky and Minister of Defense Andriy Taran, both of whom visited Washington at the beginning of September to press their case for NATO membership with President Joe Biden. And in Romania, he will see President Klaus Iohannis and Minister of National Defense Nicolae-Ionel Ciuca, amid a fresh political crisis in the country. In all three, the United States wants to expand defense support but also sees problems of democratic development and corruption. In Georgia, tens of thousands of protestors were out in the streets this week over the arrest of ex-president and opposition leader Mikheil Saakashvili and over allegations of fraud in recent elections. Ukraine is under heavy pressure from the West, which provides the country extensive aid, to halt rampant graft. ""It is our belief that strengthening democratic institutions creates greater resilience against Russian influence and external manipulation,"" the U.S. official said. ""Our bilateral assistance is actually very much focused on the specific aspects of institutional reform that are necessary for NATO. And that applies to both Georgia and to Ukraine."" Austin will end the week at NATO headquarters in Brussels, where ties with the U.S., frayed by the previous administration of Donald Trump, took a fresh hit last month when Washington unexpectedly announced a new pact with Australia and Britain focused on China in the Indo-Pacific region. The US official said Austin would reinforce U.S. commitment to the pact and press for military adaptation to address future threats.

Russia’s Foreign Ministry accused Ukrainian forces of detaining ceasefire observer Andrei Kosyak last Wednesday and failing to inform Moscow via diplomatic channels within an allotted three-day period. Ukraine says Kosyak was a Russian citizen carrying out an undercover reconnaissance mission for the separatists. “We call on Ukraine to… stop provocations on the contact line in Donbass, report the location of Russian citizen [Andrei] Kosyak and grant Russian consular staff access to him,” spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. Russian-backed separatists in the Donbass — the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk regions in southeastern Ukraine — have been locked in a 7-year war with Ukrainian forces that has killed some 13,000 people, according to a United Nations tally. “We regard Ukraine’s actions as treacherous and provocative,” Zakharova said in a statement on the Foreign Ministry’s website. Separatist-controlled Luhansk’s de-facto leader Leonid Pasechnik had identified Kosyak as the breakaway region’s “officer” who was overseeing the ceasefire during road clearing work when he was captured. Zakharova urged Europe’s main security body, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), to give a “principled assessment” of Kosyak’s detention. Protests demanding Kosyak’s release temporarily suspended the OSCE conflict monitoring mission’s work in separatist-controlled Horlivka in recent days. The mission continued after the protesters had left the Horlivka hotel housing its observers, Reuters reported Monday.

Moldovan Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Spinu was due to meet with the head of Russia's state-controlled energy giant Gazprom, Alexei Miller, in St. Petersburg on Wednesday. Spinu's government has declared a state of emergency and imported gas from outside Russia – its Soviet-era master – for the first time in its history after Gazprom hiked prices for the impoverished country. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday's talks will have an ""absolutely commercial nature."" ""There is no politicization here and there cannot be,"" he said. Russian President Vladimir Putin said this month that allegations from European capitals that Moscow was using energy as a geopolitical weapon were ""politically charged babble that have no grounds."" Moldova's contract with Gazprom ran out at the end of September. A deal has been reached for October but the Moldovan government said Moscow is sending far less gas to the country than usual. Last week, Russian media reported that Gazprom is threatening to cut the country off if it does not settle its debts and sign a new contract by December. Before heading to Russia, Spinu said he will demand ""transparent and fair prices"" from Gazprom at the talks. Wedged between Romania and Ukraine, the country of 2.6 million receives gas from Russia via its pro-Moscow separatist region of Transnistria and Ukraine.

During a bitter standoff with Moscow, Moldova declared a state of emergency and for the first time signed a gas supply deal with a non-Russian country. But on Friday both sides announced they had agreed to extend their previous agreement by five years, with deliveries to start from November 1. ""The parties reached an agreement on the price formula, the audit of the Moldova-Gaz debt and on subsequent dialogue for repayments,"" Moldovan foreign ministry spokesman Daniel Voda said in a statement. Gazprom said in a separate statement that the extension was made on ""mutually beneficial terms"". The agreement was reached after talks in Saint Petersburg, where Gazprom has its headquarters, between Moldova's Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Spinu and the Russian state-controlled firm's CEO Alexei Miller. Wedged between Romania and Ukraine, Moldova has traditionally received gas from Russia via its pro-Moscow separatist region of Transnistria and through Ukraine. But Moldova's contract with Gazprom expired in September. Gazprom extended the contract until the end of October but raised prices, which Spinu said at the time was ""not justified and not realistic"" for Europe's poorest country. As well as declaring a state of emergency, Moldova signed a contract to buy natural gas from Poland -- the first time it has turned to a supplier other than Russia. Voda on Friday said that Moldova ""received insufficient volumes of gas from Gazprom based on the one-month extension of the expired contract with a three-fold price increase"". He said the Gazprom deal had been extended ""for another five years based on the price formula proposed by the Moldovan side"", but did not give further details about prices. Europe is in the throes of an energy crisis with gas prices soaring to record highs as economies come back online after the end of pandemic lockdowns and renewables like solar and wind see a slowdown in supplies. Critics in Western capitals blame Russia for the price hikes, saying Moscow is not upping deliveries to pressure Europe to agree more long-term contracts and for the certification of the recently completed controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Some have also accused Moscow of raising prices for Moldova after the election last year of pro-European President Maia Sandu. For its part, Moscow accused Moldova or being late on payments and had threatened to turn off the tap entirely.

The Russian president enjoys the approval of 67% of Russian respondents despite weeks of record Covid-19 infections and deaths that the authorities have largely pinned on slow vaccination uptake. Putin ordered a nationwide partial lockdown from Oct. 30-Nov. 7 in a bid to slow the virus’ spread after placing most Covid-19 response decisions in the hands of regional leaders for much of the pandemic. His October approval ratings are up from 64% in September and 61% in August, Levada said. Despite the increase, Putin's approval has yet to return to the high levels seen following Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, as unpopular pension reforms and lagging living standards have fueled public discontent. Russia’s lower-house State Duma has also seen a slight boost in its approval ratings as well as the ruling, pro-Kremlin United Russia party, which increased its rating slightly to 29% from 26% in July. The results follow last month’s State Duma elections that saw United Russia claim a decisive win amid widespread reports of electoral fraud and the blocking of most opposition candidates from the ballot. According to the poll, 48% of Russians believe that the country is headed in the right direction and 43% think the country is on the wrong path.

NATO this month stripped eight Russian mission members of their accreditations, accusing them of secretly working as intelligence officers. “We are suspending the work of our official mission to NATO, including the work of our military representative from Nov. 1 or it could take a few more days,” the state-run TASS news agency quoted Lavrov as saying to reporters. Russia will also close the Western military bloc’s liaison mission — established in 2002 and hosted at the Belgian Embassy — and information bureau in Moscow, Lavrov said.

He said that in case of urgent matters, NATO could liaise via the Russian Ambassador in Belgium. According to Lavrov, Russia notified NATO of its actions in advance. Tensions between Moscow and NATO have remained at their highest levels since the Cold War in the years following Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.

The company did not book any additional capacity on pipelines running through Ukraine to the EU for the month, and ordered just a third — 31 million cubic meters per day — of the space on the Yamal pipeline running through Belarus and Poland. The decision caused gas prices in Europe to fluctuate in trading Tuesday and Wednesday. Spot prices for natural gas in Europe are trading near record highs amid concerns over low storage, a possible cold winter, and weak performance of renewable sources over the summer. Russia has been blamed for holding back on supplies and seeking to use the situation to secure fast track approval for its controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia is ready to provide more gas to the continent. Gazprom says supplies to the EU are running near record volumes over the course of the year and that it was prioritizing refilling Russia’s own gas storage facilities ahead of the winter, resulting in a 30% increase in supply to the Russian market. But with that process due to be completed by the end of October, the refusal to book additional capacity on pipelines to Europe for November looks set to prolong Europe’s gas price crisis and trigger fresh criticism of the Russian energy giant. “This could signal that Gazprom will not increase exports to Europe,” said Mitch Jennings, senior analyst at Sova Capital. European gas storage facilities are only 77% full — compared to 95% this time last year, analysts at Sova Capital highlighted in a research note Tuesday. Gazprom’s own data shows gas supplies to Europe dropped in October. Gazprom had been booking up to 15 million cubic meters of additional capacity through Ukraine earlier this year, Reuters reported. But since the completion of Nord Stream 2, Moscow has been pushing European regulators to approve the pipeline, which it says could start sending gas under the Baltic Sea to Germany almost immediately.

Drop to the floor!” Feeling anxious, she and her officemate cautiously checked what was happening. The noise was coming from a large conference room where a film about the catastrophic famine in early 1930’s Soviet Ukraine was screening. They saw two dozen thugs blocking the screen, chanting “shame!,” “fascists!,” and “get out of here!” Memorial’s staff called the police, but by the time the officers arrived most of the intruders dispersed, and police led away the three who remained. Several Memorial representatives went to the district police precinct to give testimony. Then, without explanation, the police blocked the activists and anyone else in Memorial’s building from leaving. They held them there for hours, late into the night, forcing everyone to submit a written “explanation” before they could leave. “At first, we did not understand we were being locked in. We actually continued with the screening after the thugs left.” Orlova said. “But then at around 9 p.m. I decided to call it a day. I went to the staff exit — and saw a police officer blocking the door. I told him I had a long commute ahead of me and I needed to leave — and he refused to let me out.” Uniformed and plain clothes police blocked the front entrance, she said. Supporters of Memorial who heard about the intruders had come, despite pouring rain, to offer support, but the police forced them to stay outside. “This went on for hours.” Memorial activists kept trying to get the police officers to explain what was happening and why, but could not get a coherent response. Finally, police said that everyone would be allowed to leave only if they provided a written statement describing the event itself, the intrusion and providing full passport details, residential address, phone number, as well as information about their education, workplace, and work title. “I said I won’t be doing any such thing without a lawyer present,” Orlova said. In fact, members of their legal team stood outside, but police had blocked them from entering. More time went by. A plain clothes officer who was apparently in charge demanded to see all of Memorial’s office premises, including work stations. A Memorial activist overheard police talking among themselves, saying they planned to seize some equipment. Fearing that their offices would be arbitrarily searched and documents and electronic devices confiscated, Memorial’s team redoubled their demands to see their lawyers. Meanwhile, the officers guarding the staff entrance apparently walked away, and, to ensure the door remained blocked, locked it with a pair of handcuffs from the outside. An image of the handcuffed door was widely shared on social media, contributing to public and media outcry. Exasperated, one of Memorial’s legal team members gained entry to the building through an open window and confronted the police, who eventually allowed two lawyers into the building. At 2 a.m. the police finally left, taking Memorial’s DVR with them, despite the fact that Memorial had earlier provided them with complete footage of the evening. When thanking Memorial supporters and independent media, the head of Memorial, Yan Rachinsky, said that without their support the story could have had a “different [worse] ending.” He also noted that while the thuggish attempt to disrupt the screening cost Memorial 20-30 minutes the police interference did more damage, costing them close to “seven hours and a DVR,” not to mention the stress. For years, the Russian government has smeared Memorial as a “foreign agent,” and repeatedly fined the group under this abusive legislation. And it’s not the first time pseudo-patriotic thugs have targeted Memorial, and each time, police do little, if anything, to stop them. And although police showed up last night, one has to wonder what message they were sending when they block everyone inside the building. Memorial stands up for human rights and provides a platform for free debate and artistic expression. The image of police handcuffs locking the organization’s door is an indelible symbol of the vicious crackdown on fundamental freedoms by Russian authorities, currently sweeping across the country.  Maybe that was the message.",1,707,88.52,61.9,47.84,12.78,17.24,27.86,86.7,62.94,49.65,9.19,6.22,1.27,0.42,0,0.99,2.97,2.97,14.71,10.04,2.26,14.43,4.95,4.1,6.22,0.71,13.58,4.81,3.82,8.06,1.56,0.85,5.66,7.78,0.57,7.21,1.41,0.85,0.99,1.27,0.14,2.83,0,2.4,0.85,1.56,0.99,0,0.99,0.42,0.14,0,0,14.57,6.65,0.99,0.14,0.28,0.42,3.96,8.06,0,0,0.57,0.42,1.7,0.85,0.42,0.42,3.68,0.42,0.57,2.4,0.28,0,2.83,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.4,0.42,0,0.71,0.14,0.28,0,0.14,0,0.14,4.38,12.16,0.42,2.4,7.36,1.27,0.85,0.14,4.53,7.36,0.85,0.85,0,0,0,0,0,19.38,5.8,7.21,0,0.71,1.41,4.24

Under pressure from Kiev's Western allies, Moscow later announced a pullback, but both Ukraine and the United States said at the time the withdrawal was limited.

Russia has been mustering military units on its border with Ukraine this month, in moves the EU on Friday called ""rather worrying,"" as the long-running standoff between the two becomes more unpredictable. But although the buildup comes amid unusually high tensions between Russia and the West, exacerbated by suspicions of Moscow’s involvement in Belarus’s migration crisis, U.S. navy exercises in the Black Sea, and Europe’s gas supply crisis, analysts in Russia and abroad are cautious to draw conclusions about an imminent Russian attack. “To be quite honest, I don’t see any grounds to expect an invasion,” said Andrei Kortunov, head of the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC), a Kremlin-aligned think tank. ""I don’t know what it would achieve. The losses would be huge, and the potential gains very limited."" For several weeks now, a steady trickle of information has appeared to suggest a return to hostilities in a conflict that has been mostly dormant in the seven years since Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula and reportedly sponsored a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s Russian-speaking east. Footage purporting to show Russian military hardware being moved towards Ukraine has been widely shared on social media. Meanwhile, satellite imagery of military deployments along the western frontier with Ukraine and Belarus — where separate armed exercises have been seen as a statement of political support for embattled Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko — appears to show a Russian army getting ready to move. According to Ukrainian government estimates, 114,000 Russian military personnel are now deployed in close proximity to Ukraine’s northern, southern and eastern borders. In many ways, the development resembles an earlier buildup of Russian forces in March and April this year, which sparked speculation of an imminent assault, before the troops were suddenly pulled back. Against this backdrop, Bloomberg has reported that U.S. officials have briefed European counterparts on a possible Russian assault on Ukraine. Rob Lee, a Eurasia fellow at U.S. think tank the Foreign Policy Research Institute said he doubts Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to conduct a large-scale invasion of Ukraine ""He wants to use force, or the threat of force, to get Ukraine and NATO to make concessions."" The recent increase in tensions comes on the back of years of souring ties between Moscow and Kiev. Moscow had once hoped that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a native Russian-speaker from the country’s east, might be amenable to making a deal to end the war that began when Russia-backed separatists seized Ukraine’s eastern Donbass provinces. Instead, Zelenskiy has presided over a steady worsening of relations with Russia since his election in 2019. Pressure on pro-Russian media and politicians in Ukraine, including treason charges against Viktor Medvedchuk, a Ukrainian lawmaker and longtime personal friend of Vladimir Putin, have infected the two sides’ relations with more bitterness than usual. The Minsk Protocol — a 2015 deal on a potential outline to end the war — has been mostly forgotten, with ceasefires broken and low-level fighting continuing. Meanwhile, deepening military cooperation with NATO countries, including the purchase of Turkish Bayraktar military drones earlier this year, has brought things to a head. For Russia, which has long opposed Ukraine’s entry into the U.S.-led military pact, a recent tranche of Western arms supplies and weapons deals for Kiev has raised the prospect of the country moving decisively into the NATO camp. Though formal NATO membership for Ukraine is not an immediate prospect, the Kremlin warned in September that expanding the alliance’s presence in Ukraine would still constitute a crossing of Russia’s so-called ""red lines."" In particular, the issue of drones — which were used to shell Donbass separatist positions for the first time last month — is an emotive one. In last year’s war in the separatist Nagorno-Karabakh enclave, Azerbaijan used Bayraktar drones purchased from Turkey to defeat Armenian forces and achieve a decisive victory in what had been one of the former Soviet Union’s longest running frozen conflicts. Some in Moscow worry that Ukraine may now be looking to build up its arsenals in preparation for a future decisive offensive in the Donbass. ""Zelenskiy might try to become a Ukrainian Aliev,"" said RIAC’s Kortunov, referring to the Azerbaijani president who led his country to victory in Nagorno-Karabakh. However, for many in Moscow, the fear is less of a concrete Ukrainian plan to resolve the Donbass issue than of a broader sense that the seven-year-old frozen conflict is becoming increasingly unpredictable. With Zelenskiy’s approval ratings falling to record lows, some imagine that he might attempt to rally his base by fulfilling pre-election promises to resolve the Donbass conflict ahead of presidential polls scheduled for 2024. Moreover, with a fresh summit between the Russian and American presidents in the works, the Kremlin reportedly worries that Ukraine, if undeterred, may scupper the modest thaw in U.S.-Russia relations since June’s Biden-Putin summit in Geneva. ""The fear in Moscow is that Ukrainian hawks might opt for further provocations to try to pull Russia into a full-scale confrontation,"" said Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of R.Politik, a political analysis firm. In any case, experts stress that the 114,000 Russian personnel allegedly on the border would not be sufficient to defeat Ukraine’s armed forces, estimated at around 255,000. With Ukraine having already resisted a Russian invasion in 2014 — when its army was much weaker — the costs of invading and occupying the country would likely far exceed the military units currently rallied on the Russian side of the border. ""We shouldn’t overestimate the scale of what’s going on at the border,"" said the RIAC’s Kortunov. ""There aren’t enough forces there right now to undertake a serious operation. Right now, this looks like deterrence more than anything.""",1,971,97.31,33.08,57.46,2.93,28.56,35.02,79.51,56.44,43.05,3.91,1.03,0.21,0.1,0,0.62,0,2.88,14.11,9.58,1.54,16.37,5.66,2.99,3.81,0.62,11.12,6.9,4.12,7.72,0.82,1.44,6.08,11.53,0,11.43,1.75,1.85,1.24,2.78,0.1,2.57,0.1,4.33,0.93,3.4,1.13,0.1,1.03,0.62,0.31,0,0,6.39,3.71,0.31,0,1.44,0.31,1.13,2.06,0,0,0,0.62,7.11,4.12,2.68,0.31,1.85,0,0,1.34,0.51,0,0.51,0.21,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.21,0.31,0.51,0.21,0.31,0,0.1,0.51,0.1,3.09,13.08,0.21,1.96,9.78,1.13,0,0.41,4.74,3.91,3.81,2.37,0.1,0.1,0,0,0,16.99,4.63,5.97,0,0,2.37,4.02

Under pressure from Kiev's Western allies, Moscow later announced a pullback, but both Ukraine and the United States said at the time the withdrawal was limited.

U.S. top diplomat Antony Blinken on Wednesday warned Russia against making another ""serious mistake"" on Ukraine as Washington sought clarity about troop movements near the border.

""We don't have clarity into Moscow's intentions, but we do know its playbook,"" Blinken told a joint news conference. ""Our concern is that Russia may make the serious mistake of attempting to rehash what it undertook back in 2014 when it amassed forces along the border, crossed into sovereign Ukrainian territory and did so claiming falsely that it was provoked,"" he said. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the Russian movement was ""unusual in its size and scope."" ""It's not exactly clear what the Russian intentions are,"" he said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov insisted on Friday that Russia ""does not pose a threat to anyone"" and accused NATO countries of increasing ""provocative actions."" ""We mind our own affairs and take measures to ensure our security if necessary, if there are provocative actions of our opponents near our borders,"" Peskov said.

Leading  Provocative  Exercises in Black Sea,English,Russia,"Russian President Vladimir Putin told French counterpart Emmanuel Macron on Monday that ""provocative"" U.S.-led exercises in the Black Sea were ""increasing tensions"" between Moscow and NATO, the Kremlin said. Both leaders expressed ""dissatisfaction"" with what Moscow called a ""worsening"" situation in eastern Ukraine, the Kremlin statement said. Putin ""drew attention to the provocative nature of the large scale exercises led by the United States and its allies in the Black Sea which are increasing tensions between Russia and NATO,"" the Kremlin said. Putin's comments came after Western countries raised alarm over Russian military activities near Ukraine. According to the Elysee, Macron told Putin that France was ready to defend Ukraine's territorial integrity. Last week, Putin said that the Kremlin considered recent Black Sea exercises by the U.S. and other NATO ships as a serious challenge. He told state television that Russia's Defense Ministry ""had a proposal to hold its own unplanned exercises in the same waters."" ""But I believe that this is inappropriate and there is no need to further escalate the situation,"" he said. Putin seemingly referred to several U.S. warships taking part in exercises in the Black Sea which Moscow has said it was ""monitoring."" According to the Kremlin statement, Putin also criticized Ukraine for the ""recent use"" of drones in its conflict with pro-Russia rebels. Last month, Kiev released footage of what it said was its first use of the Turkish-made TB2 Bayraktar drone against separatists. Putin said this violates peace agreements signed in Minsk in 2015. U.S. top diplomat Antony Blinken warned Moscow last week against making another ""serious mistake"" on Ukraine as Washington sought clarity about troop movements near the border. The EU has said it was also concerned by Russian military activities close to the border. The 27-nation bloc said it was monitoring the situation with partners, including the U.S. and Britain. The accusations come amid rising tensions between the EU and Moscow over a migrant stand-off on the border between Poland and Kremlin-allied Belarus.

CIA chief William Burns was in Russia for two days of meetings with top officials at the request of President Joe Biden, the U.S. Embassy has said. CNN reported last week that Burns had been sent to Moscow to warn the Kremlin about the alleged build-up of troops near Ukraine's border. It said that after his meetings in Russia, Burns spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy by phone. The Kremlin's spokesman said on Monday that Putin and Burns discussed bilateral ties, ""regional conflicts"" and a crisis in diplomatic relations. He did not provide further details. Burns, who was the U.S. ambassador to Russia in 2005-2008, visited Moscow during a severe crisis in ties between Moscow and Washington.

Capitol Rioter Seeks Asylum in Belarus – State TV,English,Russia,"A man on the FBI’s Most Wanted List for allegedly attacking police during the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot is now seeking asylum in Belarus, the ex-Soviet country’s state-run television reported Sunday. Evan Neumann, 48, is wanted in the United States on charges of violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, as well as for assaulting, resisting and obstructing law enforcement during civil disorder. Neumann denies the charges as “unfounded.” Neumann sold his California home in spring and was thought to have moved to Ukraine to evade arrest, ABC News reported this summer. “Judging by his story, [Neumann] is the same type of simple American whose shops were burned by Black Lives Matter activists,” a Belarus 1 TV channel presenter said, echoing a common talking point on Russian state television. Neumann “sought justice and asked uncomfortable questions” following the 2020 U.S. elections disputed by ex-President Donald Trump, the presenter added, “but lost almost everything and is being persecuted by the U.S. government.” Belarusian border authorities detained Neumann on the border with Ukraine on Aug. 15, Belarus 1 reported. “This situation has not only never happened, but was difficult to imagine,” said the channel’s reporter in a segment titled “Goodbye, America!” In a sit-down interview, Neumann recalled crossing swampy forests and meeting wild hogs and snakes in his journey from Ukraine to Belarus. Belarus 1 reported that Neumann traveled from the U.S. to Italy in March, then took a train to Switzerland and drove to Germany and Poland before settling in western Ukraine, where he had rented an apartment for four months. Neumann said he noticed Ukrainian security services “following” him two weeks into his stay, which prompted him to cross into neighboring Belarus and seek asylum. Belarusian migration authorities declined to comment, citing confidentiality of personal data, the Russian state-run RIA Novosti reported Monday. At least three U.S. citizens have applied for asylum in Belarus so far in 2021, the outlet added. Belarus meanwhile has been accused of orchestrating a wave of migrants and refugees, mainly from the Middle East, toward European Union members' borders in retaliation to EU sanctions.

That brings the agency's tally of Covid-19 deaths in Russia to nearly 450,000, the highest toll in Europe. A Moscow Times analysis places Russia’s excess death toll since the start of the coronavirus pandemic at 723,000. Lockdown in Russia New coronavirus restrictions came into effect across Russia on Saturday with authorities looking to stem soaring infections and deaths in Europe's worst hit country by fatalities. The paid holiday lasts until next Sunday and can be extended if Covid-19 cases do not fall. Russia has held back on imposing significant nationwide measures since ending a short lockdown at the beginning of the pandemic and instead placed its hopes on the rollout of several homegrown vaccines, including Sputnik V.  Sputnik woes Russian President Vladimir Putin complained Saturday about lack of international recognition for its Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine at a G20 summit, where leaders agreed to step up global inoculation efforts. ""This happens mainly because of dishonest competition, protectionism and because some states, especially those of the G20, are not ready for mutual recognition of vaccines and vaccination certificates,"" Putin said in video message comments to counterparts. Not our drone Turkey is not responsible for Ukraine's use of an Ankara-made drone in its conflict with pro-Moscow rebels, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said in comments published on Sunday. ""If a state buys (weaponry) from us, it's no longer a Turkish product. It might be manufactured in Turkey, but it belongs to Ukraine,"" Cavusoglu told reporters after meeting his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, on the margins of the G20 summit in Rome. Ukraine last week said it destroyed the artillery of pro-Russian separatists in the country’s east using a Bayraktar TB2k, its first combat deployment of a Turkish drone. The Kremlin had later said that Ankara’s supply of drones to Kiev risks destabilizing the eastern Ukraine conflict despite Russia’s “special” relations with Turkey. No cheeky matter Police on Saturday detained 31-year-old model Irina Volkova for posing in thong underwear in front of St. Isaac’s Cathedral in St. Petersburg on charges of “insulting religious feelings.” A court, which said the graphic photo dates back to the summer of 2020, ruled Sunday to release Volkova from custody. It added that the model blamed debt collectors for the snapshot online. Her detention came on the heels of Russia's first real prison sentence for “insulting religious feelings,” with a couple convicted for posting a photo in which they simulated oral sex across from St. Basil’s Cathedral on Red Square.

Saakashvili, who served as president between 2004 and 2013, was arrested on Oct. 1 on his return from exile in Ukraine. He has refused food for 39 days to protest against his imprisonment, which he says is politically motivated. His jailing has exacerbated a political crisis that erupted last year after the opposition denounced fraud in parliamentary elections won narrowly by the ruling Georgian Dream party. The guards ""abused me verbally, punched me on the neck, dragged me on the ground by my hair"", Saakashvili said in a letter released through his lawyer, adding that his controversial transfer to a prison hospital was ""aimed at killing"" him. He was moved on Monday to a prison hospital that rights officials say fails to ensure his proper treatment. The flamboyant pro-Western reformer's arrest provoked the largest anti-government demonstrations in a decade. Chanting Saakashvili's name, about 40,000 demonstrators flooded on Monday evening into the central Freedom Square in the Georgian capital Tbilisi, AFP reporters saw. ""A mass, permanent protest movement begins in Georgia and will not stop until Mikheil Saakashvili is set free and snap elections are called,"" Nika Melia, the chairman of Saakashvili's United National Movement party, told the crowd. ""We will not disperse, our protest will be relentless and peaceful, we will not let the regime provoke us to a civil confrontation."" Protesters then marched through downtown Tbilisi towards the prime minister's office, vowing to blockade the building. Prime Minister Irakli ""Garibashvili will not be able to leave or enter his office,"" Melia said. One of the demonstrators, businessman Niko Mgeladze, 46, said: ""Saakashvili is a victim of political vendetta, we will not stop until he is liberated."" The pro-opposition Mtavari TV station aired footage of hundreds of riot police being deployed outside government buildings. On Monday morning, doctors who examined Saakashvili said he was ""at high risk of multi-systemic complications and needs to be urgently treated in a high-tech clinic."" Georgia's rights ombudswoman Nino Lomjaria said the prison hospital failed to meet the doctors' criteria. Doctors have said Saakashvili faces an imminent risk of death as he has an underlying blood disorder that makes his hunger strike particularly dangerous. Ukraine protested against Saakashvili's transfer to a prison hospital, saying the move ""creates additional risks."" ""We call on the Georgian side to transfer Mikheil Saakashvili to a civilian medical facility without delay,"" the foreign ministry said in a note of protest sent to Tbilisi. Saakashvili, who was stripped of his Georgian passport in 2015, is now a national of Ukraine, where he headed — until his arrest — a government agency steering reforms. Saakashvili's lawyers have expressed concerns that his ""security will not be guaranteed in the prison hospital where convicted criminals are employed as paramedics."" The independent Pirveli TV channel reported that inmates in the prison hospital staged a noisy protest against Saakashvili, shouting profanities at the man who led a relentless campaign against organized crime during his tenure as president. Lomjaria, who visited Saakashvili in custody, said he was moved to a prison hospital against his will and was misled that he was to be transferred to a civilian clinic. Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili sparked an uproar recently by saying that Saakashvili ""has the right to commit suicide"" and that the government had been forced to arrest him because he refused to quit politics.",1,583,91.09,72.6,6.12,2.25,23.32,33.96,81.82,54.2,42.54,9.26,7.55,0.69,1.03,0,4.8,0,1.72,12.86,8.23,1.54,14.41,6.69,1.03,3.43,1.03,13.72,3.43,1.54,11.49,1.54,1.37,8.58,4.97,0,4.8,0.51,1.37,0.17,0.17,0.17,2.57,0,5.15,1.2,3.95,0.34,0,0.34,0.17,0.17,0,0,16.3,7.2,0,0,2.4,0.34,4.29,8.92,0,0,0.17,4.97,4.29,3.95,0,0.34,4.97,0.69,0,3.77,0.17,0.51,4.12,2.57,1.2,0,0.17,0,0,0.51,0.51,0.86,0,0,0.34,0,0,0.17,1.03,0.34,2.4,6.86,0.34,1.89,4.46,0.17,0.34,0,4.46,6.35,3.09,1.54,0,0,0,0,0,16.47,4.29,5.66,0,0,1.54,4.97

Reporters at Kyiv Post accused Kivan of attempting to “infringe” on the paper’s editorial independence with plans to expand the Kyiv Post with a Ukrainian-language edition. “We see this as the owner getting rid of inconvenient, fair and honest journalists,” they said in a joint statement posted on staff writer Anna Myroniuk’s Facebook page. “We consider the cessation of publication and the dismissal of the paper’s staff to be an act of vengeance by Adnan Kivan,” the reporters added. Kivan is a native of Syria who moved to Soviet Ukraine in the early 1980s and is now among the country’s wealthiest people. According to the U.S.-funded RFE/RL news organization, Kivan’s company Kadorr Group did not immediately comment on the Kyiv Post reporters’ allegations.

During a meeting with senior Defense Ministry officials, Putin said the military already had more than 2,000 drones at its disposal. ""More work must be done on this... in particular through the use of artificial intelligence and the latest scientific and technological advances,"" he said in remarks released by the Kremlin. Putin said drones had proven their effectiveness in recent conflicts and that Russia had developed defenses against their use, including against ""terrorist drone attacks"" in Syria. ""We have learned how to repel these attacks and are doing it effectively,"" Putin said. Drone development is part of a major push for weapons development under Putin, who has made increased Russian military might a cornerstone of his two-decade rule. A new generation of the Sukhoi stealth fighter jet — dubbed ""The Checkmate"" — was unveiled earlier this year with the ability to carry and launch drones in flight. Russia has also taken the lead in developing hypersonic missiles, which can fly more than five times the speed of sound and maneuver in mid-flight, making them hard to track and intercept. Turkey and Israel have been selling drones in the former Soviet Union and they played a key role Azerbaijan's victory over Armenia in last year's Nagorno-Karabakh war.

The deportation of Tom Vennink, Dutch daily de Volkskrant's Russia correspondent, follows BBC correspondent Sarah Rainsford's expulsion in August. Russian authorities revoked Vennink’s residence permit on Monday and gave him three days to leave the country over two administrative fines dating back years, according to de Volkskrant. He was fined in 2019 for failing to register with migration authorities on time and in 2020 for visiting the restricted border security zone of Chukotka in far northeastern Siberia. Moscow informed the Dutch government that Vennink’s visa cannot be extended on Wednesday morning, de Volkskrant said. Vennink, who has worked as de Volkskrant’s Moscow correspondent since 2015, is not allowed back in Russia until January 2025. De Volkskrant editor-in-chief Pieter Klok said it was unusual for Russian authorities to deport a foreign correspondent due to old infractions. “It’s a mystery to us why the Russian government has decided this now,” Klok said. “Such administrative offenses were never an obstacle to extending residence permits in previous years,” he added. Dutch Foreign Minister Ben Knapen said “it’s not acceptable for the Netherlands if a journalist has to leave a country against his will.” Knapen added that the ministry’s last-minute attempts to prevent the journalist’s expulsion from Russia yielded no results.

""If they impose additional sanctions on us... we must respond,"" Lukashenko said in comments to officials in Minsk released by the presidency. ""We are warming Europe, and they are threatening us,"" he said, pointing out that Russia's Yamal-Europe gas pipeline transits through Belarus to Poland. ""And what if we halt natural gas supplies?"" Pressure is building to address the plight of hundreds of migrants, mainly Kurds from the Middle East, who are stuck at the Belarus-Poland border in freezing weather. The UN Security Council was to meet later Thursday for emergency talks on the crisis, after international appeals to deal with the refugees' plight. The West accuses Lukashenko of luring the migrants to Belarus to send them across the border, in revenge for sanctions imposed last year after a heavy crackdown on the opposition. EU officials say they expect to approve new sanctions over the migrant crisis next week. Poland has deployed 15,000 troops along the border, put up a fence topped with barbed wire and approved construction of a wall on the frontier with Belarus. In a statement released for Poland's Independence Day on Thursday, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said his country was facing a ""new kind of war"" whose ""ammunition is civilians."" Poland accuses Belarus of using intimidation to force migrants to breach the frontier and refusing to allow them to leave border areas. Belarus has in turn accused Poland of violating international norms by blocking the migrants and violently beating them back. Migrants have been trying to cross the border for months but the crisis came to a head when hundreds made a concerted effort on Monday and were pushed back by Polish border guards. They set up a camp on the border, sheltering in tents and burning wood from local forests to keep warm, blocked by Polish guards behind razor-wire. Belarus says some 2,000 people are living at the camp. Teams from the UN refugee agency, the International Organization for Migration and the Red Cross visited the camp on Thursday to check on conditions and deliver aid, including hygiene kits and diapers. ""Priorities now are to prevent loss of life and move people to safer locations in Belarus,"" UNHCR chief Filippo Grandi said on Twitter. Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis told reporters his country was pushing for an evacuation corridor from the border to the Belarusian city of Grodno, which has an airport that could be used to send people back to their home countries. The migrants have been making sporadic attempts to cross, with Polish border guards reporting 468 attempts overnight Thursday. At least 10 migrants have died on the border, seven of them on the Polish side, according to Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza. Journalists and charity workers have been banned from the immediate border area by Polish authorities under state of emergency rules. Residents in the Polish town of Sokolka near the border said they were worried by the growing tensions but voiced support for the Polish government's tough stance. ""I'm afraid of the migrants getting through and what the consequences would be,"" said Henryk Lenkiewicz, a 67-year-old pensioner walking by a community noticeboard in the town center. European leaders have been putting pressure on Lukashenko's main backer, Russian President Vladimir Putin. German Chancellor Angela Merkel telephoned Putin on Wednesday to ask him ""to use his influence"" to stop what she called an ""inhumane"" instrumentalization of migrants. Poland has accused Putin of masterminding the crisis, a claim the Kremlin has dismissed as ""irresponsible."" France's Europe Minister Clement Beaune said Thursday there was no evidence that Russia was involved in trafficking migrants, adding it should be ""part of the solution because Belarus is more and more dependent on Moscow.""

The Kremlin came under scrutiny earlier this year from France and Germany over a reported deal to send 1,000 fighters from the Kremlin-linked Wagner mercenary group to the conflict-ridden state. ""We realize the need to support Mali's ability to combat terrorism,"" Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said during talks in Moscow with his Malian counterpart, Abdoulaye Diop. ""We provide the country with the necessary equipment, weapons and ammunition. We will do whatever is necessary to prevent threats to Mali's statehood and territorial integrity,"" Lavrov said. He said questions over the role of Russian mercenaries in the country should be directed to Malian authorities and that military initiatives established by private Russian citizens were not Moscow's official business. ""Regarding reports on the Malian government's plans to apply for a Russian PMC's (private military contractor's) services... this question is exclusively within the jurisdiction of the legitimate Malian government,"" Lavrov said. ""If those contracts are concluded with legitimate governments of sovereign states, I don't understand what can be seen as negative about that,"" he added.

Yet several unresolved issues had marred the Moldova-Russia gas relationship, notably accumulated debt, which played a major role in the crisis. Moldova’s gas consumption is very small at about 2.9 billion cubic meters (bcm), of which right-bank Moldova consumes about 1.3 bcm, while the breakaway republic of Transnistria consumes the rest. Moldova has no gas production of its own, and its national gas company, Moldovagaz, imports 100 percent of the country’s requirements from Gazprom. Moldovagaz owns the gas transmission network, as well as local supply and distribution companies. Gazprom owns 50 percent of Moldovagaz, with the remaining shares split between the Moldovan central government (36.6 percent) and the administration of the Transnistrian region (13.4 percent). Although Moldova is de facto a partitioned country (the Moldovan central government has no control over Transnistria), Moldovagaz is de jure a unified gas company, and all supply and transit contracts are concluded between Gazprom and Moldovagaz. It is understood that supply contracts stipulate volumes to be delivered to right-bank Moldova and Transnistria separately, with payments also made separately. Debt accumulation has been a constant feature of Russian-Moldovan gas trade throughout the post-Soviet period, with both right-bank Moldova and Transnistria running high debts, although the former’s debt has been significantly lower — and the payment discipline significantly higher — than the latter’s. By October 2021, Moldova’s gas debt stood at about $709 million (principal debt is about $433 million) for right-bank Moldova and about $7 billion for Transnistria. Prior to the end of September 2021, Gazprom supplied gas to Moldova under a 2006 five-year contract that had been extended on an annual basis. That contract, whose price formula was originally based on oil price indexation, was set to expire on September 30, 2021. Under the contract, the average annual price in 2020 was about $148 per thousand cubic meters (mcm). The second half of 2020 saw exceptionally low European gas hub prices, with the Dutch TTF hub price falling to about $75/mcm. The prevailing expectation was that low prices would continue into 2021, thus giving Moldova every incentive to seek some degree of hub price indexation. The Moldovan government apparently sought to negotiate a new contract that would give it more beneficial terms. Although no new contract was signed, the old contract was amended in January 2021 to introduce the German NCG month-ahead hub indexation for the warmer months — the second and third quarters of 2021— while preserving oil price indexation for the first and fourth quarters. Contrary to expectations, European hub prices did not remain at the low level, but started to increase in late 2020, having reached about $300/mcm by January 2021, before falling briefly to about $200/mcm by March 2021, and then increasing sharply and seemingly inexorably to about $900/mcm in September 2021, with a particularly steep rise occurring from August onwards. As some of that increase fed through the contract, the price for Moldova in September 2021 increased to $550/mcm. Suddenly oil price indexation started to look far more beneficial than hub indexation. Meanwhile, witnessing the European gas hubs’ price rally, Moldova never publicly said it wanted to extend the old contract, which would have ensured supplies at lower than hub prices, as its provisions stipulated oil-indexed prices for the fourth and first quarters. Rather, it continued to seek a new gas contract with Gazprom, although reportedly made no serious effort to negotiate it prior to the old contract nearing expiry. The new contract was one of the key issues discussed during the meeting in Chisinau on August 11 between Moldovan President Maia Sandu and Russia’s presidential envoy Dmitry Kozak. Kozak talked positively about the prospects for the new contract, saying that a “mutually beneficial” solution was needed. With the old contract about to expire, no new contract was yet in sight. Gazprom reportedly offered a hub-indexed price (about $790/mcm) with a 25 percent discount, which was conditional on debt repayment over a period of time, whereas Moldova had asked for a 50 percent discount. The price, although high, was reflective of the European gas market. As the parties failed to agree, Moldova asked Gazprom to extend the old contract for October. This request was made on the expiry date of the old contract: September 30. The contract was extended on the same conditions as in September (hub-indexed), resulting in a price of $790/mcm for October. It was not until the old contract expired—and it became clear that talks on a new contract had failed —that Moldova publicly said it wanted to extend the old contract on its previous terms. As Moldova only asked to extend the contract on September 30, Gazprom was unable to book corresponding capacity at an auction held on September 20 in accordance with the EU Capacity Allocation Mechanism (CAM) Network Code, as a result of which Moldova contracted only 54 million cubic meters (mmcm) for its right-bank consumption — the amount for which Gazprom had sufficient capacity under previous bookings — compared with the region’s 80 mmcm monthly consumption for October. As the ensuing shortage led to linepack gas in the Moldovan gas transmission system starting to be used, Moldova introduced a state of emergency on October 22 through November 20 to procure alternative supplies for balancing the grid. For several days, Moldova bought or borrowed additional gas — about 5 mmcm — from other suppliers (such as PGNiG, ERU, Vitol, and DXT) to complement its gas balance and prevent pressure from decreasing to critical levels. That gas was extremely expensive (supplies from PGNiG were about $1100/mcm at the TTF day-ahead rate), but no gas was available at lower prices. Since hubs are the prevalent price formation mechanism in Europe, no European supplier would sell gas to Moldova at a lower price. These purchases made it abundantly clear to Moldova that the only affordable way out of the imminent gas crisis was to secure a contract with Gazprom at a price lower than the hub-based price. It is unclear why the talks on the new contract collapsed. Russian President Vladimir Putin was one of the first world leaders to congratulate Sandu on her convincing victory in Moldova’s presidential elections in December 2020, and his envoy Kozak was the first high-ranking official to visit Moldova after its pro-European government took office in August 2021. As noted above, the Sandu-Kozak meeting sounded very positive. Russia stood to win nothing from a gas standoff with Moldova, either commercially or in PR terms, as it was certain to result in yet more accusations of using gas as a weapon. It seems much more likely that Moldova wanted (and may have been encouraged) to conclude only a short-term contract with Gazprom and not to accept its conditions—including on debt repayment and how to implement the EU acquis with regard to (Gazprom co-owned) Moldovagaz—while hoping there would be a safety net provided should the negotiations fail. No such safety net materialized. As the crisis was unfolding, the EU provided Moldova with financial assistance worth 60 million euros (the equivalent of about two-thirds of Moldova’s monthly consumption at current hub prices) “to set up a support scheme for the most vulnerable people,” but otherwise remained largely on the sidelines. Moldovan Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita asked the EU for help, saying that without a contract with Gazprom, Moldova would need to spend about 800 million euros over the next five months on alternative imports at market prices to meet its winter demand. The EU High Representative for Foreign Policy Josep Borrell said on October 28 that the solution to the crisis would “not come from the European Union funding all the differences between the current prices and the prices that Gazprom is asking for.” The EU’s message could hardly have been clearer, and Moldova signed its contract with Gazprom on the following day, October 29. On October 29, Gazprom and Moldovagaz signed a five-year contract, and supply began on November 1. The contract is understood to be an extension of the old one, with some adjustments. Although the formula has not been published, it reportedly takes into account the price of oil and gas in the preceding nine months, with 70 percent being indexed to oil prices and 30 percent to hub gas prices, with adjustments to be made quarterly. The price for November is about $450/mcm (over 60 percent less than the current hub prices at which Moldova bought balancing gas in the preceding days, and over 40 percent less than the contract hub-indexed price at which it bought gas from Gazprom in October). As before, Russian gas will be delivered at the Moldova-Ukraine border, thus enabling supplies both to right-bank Moldova and Transnistria (through which it will transit). In addition to the contract, a separate protocol was signed aimed at resolving prior disagreements. It addresses inter alia two specific problems that have complicated the Moldova-Russia gas relationship: the accumulation of debt, and the implementation of unbundling provisions of the EU acquis in respect of Moldovagaz. As stated in the protocol, Moldovagaz and Gazprom agreed to conduct an independent audit of Moldovagaz’s debt (with regard to supplies to right-bank Moldova) in 2022 to confirm the amount owed, with further negotiations to be held on the method and the repayment schedule. The protocol stipulates that the amount of debt is to be confirmed by May 2022 and paid back over a five-year period. The protocol also addresses the issue of Moldovagaz’s restructuring. As a contracting party of the Energy Community Treaty (EnCT), Moldova has committed to implement the EU energy acquis, including its unbundling provisions, under which Moldovagaz’s transmission activities would have to be separated from its supply activities. Gazprom, which owns 50 percent of shares in Moldovagaz, stands to be affected by unbundling, not least by the lack of certainty as to what entity will pay the debt once restructuring is complete. The protocol ensures forced restructuring will not be possible until full settlement of the debt, in the amount confirmed by the audit. Notably, the acquis allows for several unbundling models: ownership unbundling, which would necessitate the transmission network being sold off, is not mandatory, and other models allowing for the preservation of network ownership are also possible. It is easy to imagine that Gazprom’s concern over who will pay the debt once Moldovagaz’s unbundling is complete was construed as trying to force Moldova not to implement the EU acquis or undermining its government, thus giving rise to easy (and somewhat lazy) — but unconvincing — narratives of Russia having provoked the crisis to undermine Moldova’s new pro-European government. While there have been allegations of Russia imposing political conditions on Moldova — such as Chisinau’s withdrawal from the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area — in exchange for signing the contract, and the EU’s Borrell referred—without offering evidence—to “attempts by Gazprom to put political pressure in return to lower the gas prices,” both Sandu and Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Spinu have stated that no political conditions were attached as part of Moldova’s agreeing to the contract. The Russian-Moldovan gas relationship has always been heavily skewed in Russia’s favor because of Moldova’s high dependence on Russian gas imports, for which it was not able to pay in full and on time, and its relatively minor transit role compared to Ukraine and Belarus. The nature of this asymmetry has changed over time due to the construction of the TurkStream gas pipeline from Russia to Turkey, which has reduced Moldova’s transit role further, and the new Romania-Moldova interconnector (owned by the Romanian national gas company Transgaz), which enables Moldova to import gas from suppliers other than Gazprom, at least in the amount needed for its right-bank consumption. Having the technical ability to import gas from other suppliers strengthened Moldova’s position vis-à-vis Gazprom in that the latter is unable to demand a price for its gas higher than the price set by the European hubs. Of course, there is nothing to stop Gazprom from offering Moldova a discount on that price if it wishes to do so. At a time when European hub prices are at historic highs, the conclusion of the new five-year contract with Gazprom—which has elements of both gas hub and oil price indexation, and a nine-month lag, making it possible to even out the impact of high prices and volatility over time—is a positive development for Moldova, securing its gas supply balance ahead of winter and alleviating serious pressure on its very weak finances. While Gazprom has been able to rein in right-bank Moldova’s debt, its ability to extract payment from Transnistria, which has accumulated about $7 billion of debt, remains seriously constrained by the region’s undefined status. A lasting political solution of Transnistria’s “frozen” conflict would be conducive to the improved economic performance of Moldova (including Transnistria), and would enhance its ability to pay for its gas imports in the future — both from Gazprom and other suppliers. A broader point in European-Russian gas relations is that despite a significant—and successful — effort made by the EU in the 2010s to diversify supplies and reduce the dependence of its most vulnerable member states on Russian gas, Russia will continue to remain an important supplier of gas both to the EU and non-EU countries in the shared EU-Russia neighborhood — Moldova, Belarus, and non-EU Balkan countries —due to the competitiveness of its gas. The Moldovan crisis has demonstrated that no European supplier will sell gas at a price below hub level and that any country — especially where the EU acquis is being implemented — can be sure that Gazprom’s price will not be higher than the price set by the European hubs (which makes Gazprom a supplier like any other) and may be lower (which could make Gazprom a preferred supplier in countries with weaker economies). The ongoing European gas supply crunch this winter has demonstrated the limitations of EU diversification efforts. It is important to recognize this and encourage countries in the shared EU-Russia neighborhood to create gas markets on which both Gazprom and non-Gazprom exporters can compete.",1,2377,96.36,20.21,32.98,37.14,32.12,31.26,78.67,58.86,45.52,4.21,0.17,0,0,0,0.08,0,4.04,14.39,8.71,3.79,17.59,5.72,2.94,5.26,1.01,9.51,6.65,6.69,3.83,0.55,1.22,2.19,9.59,0.8,8.79,1.09,1.47,1.26,1.22,0.29,3.58,0,2.31,1.72,0.55,0.13,0.08,0,0,0,0,0,3.79,2.82,0.38,0.17,0.21,0.08,0.97,0.72,0,0,0.04,0.04,2.1,1.18,0.8,0.13,7.78,0.13,0.08,3.37,4.25,0.08,0.21,0.13,0,0,0,0,0,0.04,0,0.67,0.21,0.67,0.08,0.25,0,0.42,0.5,0.04,2.02,7.03,0.29,0.46,6.18,0.21,0.04,0.08,5.72,4.71,2.23,0.97,0.04,0,0.04,0,0,14.51,3.28,4.63,0,0,1.26,5.34
312,themoscowtimes.com,1636358400,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/11/08/in-russias-south-the-remains-of-a-greek-city-hint-at-cosmopolitan-past-a75501,"In Russia South , the Remains of a Greek City Hint at Cosmopolitan Past",English,Russia,"SENNOY, Krasnodar Region — Amid the deep coves and narrow crevices that honeycomb this part of Russia’s Black Sea coast, archaeologists have for eighty years chipped away at one of Europe’s richest historical treasure troves. Ever since Russia conquered the Taman peninsula — a hilly, lagoon-studded spur of land that faces annexed Crimea across the Kerch Strait — in 1828, scholars have puzzled over how Phanagoria, the dynamic Ancient Greek colony it housed, could have thrived for almost two millennia before vanishing almost without trace. “You can find grand stone cities anywhere on the Mediterranean,” said Vladimir Kuznetsov, a 68-year-old archaeologist who has been working on the site since 1978. “But what we have at Phanagoria is different.” Situated outside the small village of Sennoy, Phanagoria, now one of Russia’s best-resourced and highest-profile digs, shines a light not just on the region’s long-lost Ancient Greek heritage, but also on how Russian archaeologists have had to adapt to a difficult financial environment with limited state support. Though archaeologists have been working at Phanagoria on and off since 1936, few of the site’s recent finds would ever have been made, were it not for a chance — and very Russian — twist of fate. In 2004, billionaire industrialist Oleg Deripaska — owner of the RusAl aluminium company and a native of the local Krasnodar region who owns a home a few hours’ drive from Phanagoria — began financing the excavations. His Volnoe Delo charitable foundation has so far donated $16.4 million to the project. Strung out along a remote, uninhabited stretch of a slender cove that burrows its way into the peninsula, rising seas and shifting dunes have buried ancient Phanagoria under an unusually thick layer of sand and swamps. For professional archaeologists — whose work is often obstructed by modern structures — it’s a scientific dream come true. “The archaeological layer here runs six metres deep, with each era in the city’s history preserved on top of the last. It’s very rare to have a layer so deep,” said Kuznetsov. Nestled as it is today between the budget resort villages of the Black Sea riviera and the hypersensitive military bottleneck of the Kerch Strait, it is hard to imagine that the Taman peninsula was once a thriving commercial hub. However, Phanagoria, a Greek colony founded around 543 BC by refugees from the Persian conquest of Anatolia, grew into a prosperous city-state on the back of trade with the Scythian tribes of what is now Ukraine. Though only around two percent of the Phanagoria site has been excavated, finds already testify to a wealthy and powerful settlement, passed down through the succession of empires that have dominated Russia’s southern steppe. There’s the fragment of marble wall engraved with Persian cuneiform text, the only one of its kind ever found outside the former Persian Empire. The menorah-engraved tombstones, evidence that the faith of the Khazars — a tribe of Turkic nomads who converted to Judaism in the first millennium — was present in this part of Russia. Or its Christian diocese, Russia’s oldest, which predates the conversion of Kievan Rus to Christianity by almost 500 years. Phanagoria’s sudden extinction, around the year 1000, remains an archaeological mystery. Historians say a letter discovered in a Cairo archive in the late nineteenth century may hint that early Russian invaders from the north were responsible. Though archaeology has never been chief among rich Russians’ charitable causes, a string of bespoke archaeological funds help wealthy Russians support digs. Deripaska’s support of Phanagoria, however, makes him the single biggest donor to archaeological causes in Russia, and Phanagoria by far the country’s best-financed dig. “For rich Russians, supporting archaeology is a lot like supporting artistic causes,” said Elisabeth Schimpfossl, a senior lecturer at the U.K.’s Aston University and author of a book on rich Russians and their philanthropic habits. “It’s often about filling in gaps where state provision is lacking.” Though individual philanthropy plays a major role in archaeology all around the world, in Russia — where government grants for the field are rare to non-existent — private largesse has assumed particular importance. “In Russia, there is no direct state aid for archaeology,” said Anastasia Stoyanova, an archaeologist and head of Millenium Legacy, a charitable fund supporting digs in Crimea. “There are a few indirect grants but it’s almost impossible to actually get one, and they don’t provide the long-term, year-on-year support you need for a serious project, anyway.” In the absence of meaningful state subsidies, many Russian archaeological projects are financed by so-called “rescue archaeology,” or commercial contracts to excavate construction sites. With developers legally required to pay to excavate lands they plan to build on, Russian archaeologists are often forced to recycle their private earnings from commercial work to support their academic projects themselves. With the broader field’s funding tenuous, Phanagoria has emerged as a lavishly resourced outlier, even as much of the rest of Russia’s archaeological heritage remains underexplored and at risk. “In general, the outlook for archaeology in Russia isn’t great,” said Stoyanova. “There are a handful of sites like Phanagoria, which are very well provided for. But apart from that, the situation is tough.” For Kuznetsov, who recalls working on the Phanagoria site with only his wife during the economic crisis of the 1990s when funding for archaeology withered away, financing from Deripaska — who has been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department — has been transformational. “Not having to worry about your funding does give you a certain freedom,” he said. On the walls of Phanagoria’s luxurious, Deripaska-built visitors’ complex hang photographs of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Defense Minister Sergei Shoygu, both of whom have visited the excavations. Out on the site, the results of the site’s lavish funding are even clearer. Its financing guaranteed, Phanagoria has been able to attract an expansive team of scholars, including numismatists to study the city’s coinage, and anthropologists to reconstruct its everyday life. Analysis of human remains found at the site has enabled the project to make groundbreaking discoveries, including determining an ancient Phanagorian’s life expectancy — 38 years — and to identify the parasites that likely inhabited their bodies. “Without exaggeration, I honestly don’t think there’s a team like ours anywhere else in Russia,” said Kuznetsov. Now, a vast new museum complex is planned to cater for Russian tourists travelling to annexed Crimea on the newly built bridge, which spans the Kerch Strait within view of Phanagoria. For Kuznetsov and his team, however, the focus remains on excavating the as-yet-untouched remainder of the 65-hectare site. One story, of the deposed Byzantine emperor Justinian II who was reputedly exiled to Phanagoria at the turn of the eighth century, has spurred many to wonder what else might be hidden beneath the peninsula’s rolling hills. “If a Byzantine emperor lived here, you’d assume he had a palace,” said Kuznetsov, gesturing toward the gentle, grassy slopes around the digsite. “I just don’t know where it is yet.”",1,1144,93.48,44.72,56.75,37.87,25.42,30.94,78.67,59.44,47.29,5.51,2.71,0.17,0.17,0.52,0.52,0.61,2.8,14.25,9.79,2.45,16.17,6.47,5.86,3.93,0.79,10.66,7.69,4.11,3.58,0.87,0.87,1.92,9.97,0.79,9.18,2.27,1.49,0.52,2.01,0.26,2.97,0.09,2.1,1.66,0.44,0.09,0,0.09,0.09,0,0,0,7.34,3.23,1.57,0,0.17,0,1.05,4.02,0.09,0,0.09,0.52,2.53,0.87,1.66,0,6.56,0.17,0.09,3.23,2.8,0.44,0.61,0.09,0.09,0,0,0,0,0,0.09,0.61,0,0.09,0.17,0,0,0.17,0.26,0.26,3.67,11.1,0.09,0.79,9.62,0.52,0,0.09,4.28,4.2,4.55,0.52,0.26,0.26,0.09,0,0,18.09,4.37,6.73,0,0,2.88,4.11

Escalating  Russia - Ukraine Tensions by Arming Kiev – Kremlin,English,Russia,"The United States is “escalating” the tense situation between Kiev and Moscow by sending weapons and military advisers to Ukraine, the Kremlin said Tuesday. The comments come after CNN reported, citing unnamed sources familiar with the deliberations, that the Biden administration is considering sending Javelin anti-tank missiles, stinger air defense missiles and military advisers to Ukraine amid Western concerns of getting caught by surprise with a possible Russian invasion in January. The Pentagon has also reportedly been pressing Washington to redirect equipment including Russian-made Mi-17 helicopters from its original destination of Afghanistan to Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said military advisers and weapons systems are arriving in Ukraine “not only from the U.S. but other NATO countries.” “This all leads to further escalation,” the state-run TASS news agency quoted Peskov as saying. Peskov also accused the Ukrainian armed forces of making “provocations” with the possible goal of reclaiming southeastern territories lost during its war with pro-Moscow rebels. “We are deeply concerned about the provocative actions of the Ukrainian armed forces on the line of contact and preparations for a possible military solution of the Donbass problem,” he added, referring to the separatist-held Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine. Peskov previously dismissed the claims of Russian troops massing near the Ukraine border as “hysteria” and as non-threatening domestic military moves. “Who’ll be attacking whom? Russia — Ukraine or Ukraine — Russia?” Peskov asked. “We assert that Ukraine is planning aggressive actions against Donbass.” Putin previously blamed the West for “escalating” the Ukraine conflict with Black Sea drills and U.S. bomber flights near Russian borders.

The comments come as Russia musters military units on its border with Ukraine. Moscow has dismissed growing Western claims that Russia may be preparing to invade Ukraine, instead accusing NATO of provocations. ""There is a threat today that there will be war tomorrow,"" Zelenskiy told a a marathon press conference with Ukrainian and international media. ""We are entirely prepared for an escalation."" Zelensky also called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to deny he was planning to invade Ukraine. ""The president of Russia should say in public: 'We are not planning this',"" he said. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg repeated Western concerns about the build-up on Friday and warned that ""if Russia uses force against Ukraine, that will have costs, that will have consequences."" Kiev has been at war with pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine for nearly eight years in a conflict that has taken over 13,000 lives. Ukraine and its Western allies accuse Russia of funding and arming the rebels, claims Moscow denies. Zelenskiy did not give details of the coup plot or accuse the Russian state of involvement, although he did say it involved Russian citizens. “I received information that a coup d'etat will take place in our country on Dec. 1-2,” he said. Zelenskiy said the Ukrainian security services obtained audio recordings in which the alleged plotters — named only as “representatives” of Ukraine and Russia — discuss their plans, mentioning billionaire Rinat Akhmetov’s possible involvement. He clarified that he believes Akhmetov, an energy tycoon whose media holdings have ramped up criticism of Zelenskiy in recent weeks, is not involved in the coup plot himself. “Let’s just say [the plotters] are discussing with Russia Rinat Akhmetov’s participation in the coup d’état in Ukraine, which will attract $1 billion,” he said. The Kremlin denied any involvement. “We don’t engage in that,” Interfax quoted Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov as telling reporters. Zelenskiy’s “de-oligarchization” campaign to reduce the influence of Ukraine’s wealthiest people on the country’s politics has been met with criticism from the Ukrainian elite.

Hysteria  Over Ukraine Conflict,English,Russia,"Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Sunday slammed the United States for driving ""hysteria"" over a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine, after Western countries accused Moscow of a troop build-up near the ex-Soviet country. His comments come as Western countries this week raised alarm over Russian military activity near Ukraine and Washington said it has ""real concerns"" over what it called ""unusual"" activity. ""This hysteria is being whipped up artificially,"" Peskov said on state television. ""Those who have brought their armed forces from overseas are accusing us of unusual military activity on our own territory. That is, the United States."" Ukraine's army has been locked in a simmering conflict with pro-Russian separatists in two breakaway regions bordering Russia since 2014, after Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine. Kiev and its Western allies accuse Russia of sending troops and arms across the border to support the separatists — claims Moscow denies. Peskov's comments come after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Saturday declined to say whether U.S. intelligence believed Russian President Vladimir Putin was aiming to seize land from Ukraine. ""We don't know what President Putin's intentions are. But we do know what's happened in the past,"" Blinken said. ""We know the playbook of trying to cite some illusory provocation from Ukraine or any other country and using that as an excuse for what Russia plans to do all along."" Putin for his part said Thursday that the West is ""escalating"" the Ukraine conflict by holding drills in the Black Sea and flying bombers near its borders. After an uptick in violence at the beginning of the year, Russia massed around 100,000 troops on Ukraine's borders in the spring, raising fears of a major escalation in the conflict which has claimed over 13,000 lives. Russia later announced a pullback but both Ukraine and its ally the United States said at the time the withdrawal was limited. Deputy Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, meanwhile, said Sunday that preparations were underway for another summit between Putin and U.S. President Joe Biden, after they met in Geneva earlier this year. Despite increased contacts between the two rivals since the June summit, tensions have recently spiked. In addition to the Ukraine conflict, the United States has warned Russia over its alleged influence in the migrant crisis on the Belarus-Poland border as well a missile strike on a satellite last week.

The comments come after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russia has gathered nearly 100,000 troops near its border and that Western countries had shared information about active Russian troop movements with Kiev. “We’re not recording any neighboring country’s equipment or military movement directly near the border,” Ukrainian state border service spokesman Andriy Demchenko said. “If any actions are taking place, they may be tens or even hundreds of kilometers from the state border,” the Russian state-run TASS news agency quoted Demchenko as saying on Ukraine's 24 Kanal channel. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said the U.S.-led alliance spotted “large and unusual concentrations of Russian forces” at Ukraine’s border in recent weeks. Western officials also accuse Moscow of using the escalating migrant crisis on the Polish-Belarus border to “distract” from its activities near Ukraine. The Kremlin has dismissed the concerns as unfounded, instead complaining about increased NATO activity in the region. Ukraine remains locked in a festering conflict with pro-Russia separatists in the east of the country that started seven years ago. French President Emmanuel Macron expressed “willingness to defend the territorial integrity of Ukraine” to Russian President Vladimir Putin in a telephone conversation Monday. Putin responded by saying that negotiations were ""made difficult"" by the Ukrainian authorities, the Elysee said. It added that this line of reasoning was ""often"" used by the Russian leader.

Just last month, he spent several hours discussing world affairs at the annual Valdai Club meeting; more recently, he gave a wide-ranging interview to Russian TV, in which he discussed Ukraine, Belarus, NATO, and the United States. His appearance on Nov. 18 at a gathering of Russian Foreign Ministry senior officials resulted in a public speech and more private discussions, which of course remain confidential. The speech was fairly short, but made several important new points. The most interesting and intriguing passage concerned Russia’s adversaries: the United States, its NATO allies, and clients such as Ukraine. “Our recent warnings have had a certain effect: tensions have arisen there anyway,” Putin told the assembled officials. “It is important for them to remain in this state for as long as possible, so that it does not occur to them to stage some kind of conflict… we do not need a new conflict,” the Russian president added. Putin did not mean diplomatic warnings. Diplomacy is de facto paralyzed in Russia’s relations with Ukraine, NATO, the European Union’s leading powers such as Germany and France, and with the United States as far as Ukraine is concerned. The Kremlin has at this point completely written off Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as a negotiating partner. In exasperation with the Europeans de facto siding with Kiev against Moscow on the implementation of the Minsk Agreements, the Foreign Ministry published diplomatic correspondence between its head Sergey Lavrov and his counterparts in Paris and Berlin; according to Sergei Ryabkov, Lavrov’s deputy, recent exchanges on Ukraine with visiting U.S. Under Secretary of State Victoria Nuland produced zero results and zero understanding in Washington of Moscow’s arguments. The Kremlin also responded to NATO’s expulsion of Russian officers attached to Moscow’s mission to Brussels by severing all ties with the alliance. Instead, the warnings the Russian president was likely referring to are the activities of the Russian military. At the beginning of the year, the Russian Defense Ministry held a major exercise that included a concentration of significant forces along the entire length of the border with Ukraine: to its north, east, and south. Russian troop movements were made clearly visible, and carried the chilling message that it might not be a drill. Dmitry Kozak, the Kremlin point man on Donbass and relations with Kiev, repeated Putin’s earlier warning that a Ukrainian attempt to retake the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk regions — à la then Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili’s doomed adventure in South Ossetia in 2008 — would mean the end of the present Ukrainian state. Indeed, the exercises were taken seriously by the Americans. General Mark Milley, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, engaged in direct consultations with General Valery Gerasimov, chief of the Russian General Staff. Finally, U.S. President Joe Biden invited Vladimir Putin to a meeting in Geneva which resulted in a resumption of U.S.-Russian strategic stability talks. Yet there was no de-escalation with regard to Ukraine, the Black Sea region, and, more broadly, Eastern Europe. During the summer, a British Navy destroyer challenged Russia by sailing through territorial waters off Crimea, and Ukraine passed legislation that denied ethnic Russians the status of an indigenous community and prepared to adopt another law that, in Moscow’s view, would be tantamount to Kiev formally leaving the Minsk accords. In Donbass, the Ukrainians used a Turkish-made drone to strike pro-Russian forces; NATO significantly increased its presence and activity in the Black Sea; and U.S. strategic bombers flew missions as close as 20 kilometers from the Russian border, according to Putin. The gas price crunch in Europe provoked bitter accusations that Russia had caused it. Even the migrant crisis on Poland’s border, part of a plan by Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko to punish the EU and coerce its leaders into a dialogue with him, was blamed directly on the Kremlin. What some in Moscow had prematurely called the “spirit of Geneva” all but evaporated. Not that Russia was doing nothing to respond to and even get ahead of its adversaries. Russia allowed half a million of its newly acquired citizens in Donbass to vote in the September elections to the State Duma; made the produce of Donbass enterprises eligible for Russian government purchases; and stopped coal deliveries to Ukraine. Both President Putin and former president Dmitry Medvedev, now serving as deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, published long articles that were scathingly critical of the policies of the Ukrainian authorities and essentially concluded that there was no use talking to Kiev anymore. Against that background, reports appeared in the United States suggesting that Russia was again massing its forces on the border, and possibly preparing to invade Ukraine sooner rather than later. Right now, fears of a war in Ukraine are widespread. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has warned the Kremlin not to try to repeat what it did in 2014, lest it regret it. In fact, the stakes are much higher today than they were seven-plus years ago. In 2014, Putin, having received a mandate from the Russian parliament to use military force “in Ukraine,” limited its factual use to Crimea, plus, in a covert form, Donbass. Next time, as Putin’s own words suggest, the geographic scope of Russian military action, should the Russian commander-in-chief order it, is likely to be much broader. Those speculating what form it might take need not look at the ancient precedents of Afghanistan, Czechoslovakia, or Hungary. It makes more sense to look at Syria, except that a war in Ukraine may not be contained. Will President Putin make the fateful decision? Is Ukraine that “unfinished business” that he will seek to complete before the end of his reign? Or is Putin just bluffing? A few things are clear. NATO membership or not, seeing Ukraine turn into a U.S.-controlled unsinkable aircraft carrier parked on Russia’s border just a few hundred miles from Moscow — an apt comparison by my Carnegie colleagues in Washington — is no more acceptable to the Kremlin than that other unsinkable aircraft carrier, Cuba, was to the White House almost sixty years ago. Any Russian leader would seek to prevent such anchorage, using whatever means they have at their disposal. Another contingency would be massive military action by Ukrainian forces in Donbass, however unlikely that may seem in the West. What Saakashvili did in trying to retake South Ossetia by force back in 2008 never looked too clever to begin with, and yet he was not stopped by Georgia’s senior ally. In his speech to diplomats on Thursday, Putin called Western countries unreliable. In particular, he accused them of only “superficially” acknowledging Russia’s red lines and warnings — whatever he may have meant by that “superficiality.” Putin has called on Lavrov to provide Russia with “serious long-term guarantees” in the Euro-Atlantic region. That sounds puzzling. There is little that Russian diplomats can do to procure for Putin what he wants. More likely, the head of state may be exhorting his diplomats to exploit the fruits of military deterrence that Putin is busy organizing around Ukraine, in the Black Sea region, and elsewhere in Europe’s east. The Russian president is not, of course, leaving that task entirely to his subordinates. Even as he was delivering his hardline speech, his Security Council secretary was in talks with the U.S. National Security Adviser about another possible meeting between Putin and Biden. As always with deterrence, it can only work if the threat is believed to be credible, while any attempt to test whether the other side is bluffing may end in disaster.

U.S. intelligence shared with some NATO members reportedly expresses “high confidence” that Russia could invade Ukraine from annexed Crimea, the western Russian border and Belarus as soon as next year, Bloomberg reported. “America and others are not saying a war is certain, or even that they know for sure Putin is serious about one,” Bloomberg said. It added that its sources “said it is likely [Putin] has not yet decided what to do.” Bloomberg reported that around half of the 100,000 soldiers are already in position for a rapid, large-scale push through “rough terrain and freezing conditions” over extensive territory and potentially prolonged occupation. Citing two unnamed people familiar with the intelligence-sharing, Bloomberg reported that Russia has also carried out an unannounced call-up of reservists “to secure territory in a later phase.” The Kremlin said Monday that the multiple reports of Russia’s planned invasion of Ukraine are “camouflage” for Ukraine’s “belligerent” attempts to reclaim ceded pro-Moscow eastern territories with outside help.

His remarks come after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday warned Russia against any ""military adventurism"" on the borders of Ukraine and EU member Poland.

Later on Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to address a Foreign Ministry meeting with ""detailed"" remarks, Peskov said. NATO and Western governments have denounced a build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, which has been fighting a war with pro-Russia separatists in its east since 2014. Russia had carried out large-scale drills near the Ukraine border and in annexed Crimea in the spring, sparking concerns of a possible invasion. Kiev, which in recent weeks downplayed the scale of Russia's presence at its borders, said Thursday it was seeking more military aid from the West. Videos circulated recently on social media have shown Russia moving troops, tanks and missiles towards the Ukrainian border. ""Russia's aggressiveness, both diplomatic and military, has increased considerably in recent weeks,"" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told a press briefing. The minister said that after his visits to Washington and Brussels ""work is underway to develop a comprehensive package for the containment of Russia."" He added that Kiev is in negotiations with the West for ""the supply of additional defense weapons for our army."" Moscow, in turn, has accused Kiev and the West of warmongering. In a call with French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday, Putin said U.S.-led exercises in the Black Sea were ""provocative"" and were ""increasing tensions"" between Moscow and NATO. According to the Elysee, Macron told Putin that France was ready to defend Ukraine's territorial integrity. Some Western governments have also accused Moscow of helping orchestrate the migrant crisis on the Belarus-Poland border. Several thousand migrants — mostly from the Middle East — have been staying in makeshift camps on the border in hopes of entering the EU. Brussels has accused Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko of luring the migrants to the border as revenge for sanctions against his regime over last year's crackdown on protests. Lukashenko and the Kremlin have rejected the accusations and criticized the EU for not taking in the migrants. The Belarusian strongman has twice spoken by telephone this week with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in his first direct contacts with a Western leader since last year's disputed presidential election.

Addressing an investor conference via video link, Putin declined to say whether Moscow planned to move troops across Ukraine's border — as the West has been alleging for weeks. ""Look, they spoke about a possible Russian military intervention in Ukraine at the beginning of the year. But as you see this did not happen,"" Putin said. ""It is not about intervening or not intervening, fighting or not fighting. It's about mending ties,"" Putin said, adding that it was important to take into account the security interests of all parties. ""If we sincerely strive to achieve this then no one will feel threatened."" Putin addressed investors as tensions spiral between Moscow and Brussels, and NATO looks to counter a fresh Russian military buildup on Ukraine's border. The new buildup follows a similar surge in the spring, when Russia gathered around 100,000 troops on Ukraine's borders but later announced a drawdown. Putin said Moscow was concerned by Western moves to conduct large-scale previously unannounced military drills near Russia's borders, singling out U.S.-led exercises in the Black Sea. Separately, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov lobbed a series of new accusations against Kiev and said Russia reserved the right to respond if its security was threatened. ""We simply don't have the right to exclude that the Kiev regime may embark on a military adventure. This all creates a direct threat to Russia's security,"" Lavrov told reporters, speaking alongside his Brazilian counterpart Carlos Franca. ""If the West is unable to contain Ukraine, but, on the contrary, will incite it, then of course, we will take all the necessary steps to ensure our reliable security."" Last week Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that Russia was sending ""very dangerous"" signals with troop movements on the border, warning that his military was ready to push back any offensive. Moscow, which seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and backs separatists fighting Kiev, has strongly denied it is plotting an attack and blames NATO for fueling tensions.

His comments come as the U.S. accuses Moscow of a troop build-up near Ukraine. Western countries have for days raised alarm over Russian military activity near Ukraine, with Washington warning Moscow against making another ""serious mistake"" in the ex-Soviet country. ""(Our) Western partners are escalating the situation by supplying Kiev with lethal modern weapons and conducting provocative maneuvers in the Black Sea,"" Putin said in a speech to the Foreign Ministry. He claimed that Western bombers are flying ""20 kilometers from our border."" The longtime Russian leader said Moscow has been ""constantly raising concerns about this"" but ""all our warnings and talk about red lines are treated superficially."" Putin has been voicing concern about U.S. naval exercises in the Black Sea for days, telling his French counterpart this week that they were ""provocative"" and leading to ""increasing tensions"" between Moscow and NATO. He has also slammed Ukraine for using a Turkish-made drone against pro-Moscow rebels. The Black Sea is a sensitive region for Russia, which controls the Crimea peninsula after annexing it from Ukraine in 2014. Since then, Kiev has fought a conflict with pro-Russia rebels in the east of the country which has claimed more than 13,000 lives. Renewed Western speculation about Russia's plans in eastern Ukraine have come amid a clash over an unexpected migrant crisis on the border with Kremlin-aligned Belarus and EU member Poland. The EU has accused the Kremlin-backed regime of Alexander Lukashenko in Belarus of purposefully luring thousands of migrants — mostly from the Middle-East — to its doorstep as revenge for sanctions. Some in the EU, including Poland, have said that Moscow is also behind the crisis. ""Brussels needs to understand that the decreasing of military-political tensions is not only in Russian interests, but in those of the whole of Europe, and even the world,"" Putin said. Earlier on Thursday, the Kremlin said Europe should not blame Russia for ""all problems."" ""Russia has an interest in everybody in Europe finally coming to their senses and stopping considering Russia the culprit of all problems,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. He added that Europe should instead ""address the primary sources of the problems that are currently suffocating Europe."" Peskov's remarks come after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday warned Russia against any ""military adventurism"" on the borders of Ukraine and EU member Poland. ""Recently there have been a lot of hysterical publications in Britain,"" Peskov said. ""Russia is not waging any hybrid wars,"" he added. Russia had carried out large-scale drills near the Ukraine border and in annexed Crimea in the spring, sparking concerns of a possible invasion. Kiev, which in recent weeks downplayed the scale of Russia's presence at its borders, on Thursday said it was seeking more military aid from the West. Videos circulated recently on social media have shown Russia moving troops, tanks and missiles towards the Ukrainian border. ""Russia's aggressiveness, both diplomatic and military, has increased considerably in recent weeks,"" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told a press briefing. The minister said that after his visits to Washington and Brussels ""work is under way to develop a comprehensive package for the containment of Russia."" He added that Kiev is in negotiations with the West for ""the supply of additional defense weapons for our army."" Moscow, in turn, has accused Kiev and the West of warmongering.

But those of the past two weeks are unprecedented. For the first time, all three Eastern Slavic states — Belarus, Russia and Ukraine — are simultaneously involved. And the range of issues in play — military power, energy trade and migrant flows — is wider than ever. The region has become complex, unpredictable and increasingly dangerous. Two factors drive this. First, despite his suppression of last year’s nationwide demonstrations, Alexander Lukashenko knows that Belarus is not stable. Infuriated and threatened by the West’s sanctions and refusal to recognise him as president, he is seeking to intimidate rather than, as after previous crackdowns, restore relations with the West. The artificial migrant crisis, and empty threat to cut gas transit, reveal the futile desperation of an insecure despot whose judgement is deserting him. The Belarusian regime, long a dictatorship, is becoming a pariah. The second source of instability is Russia’s growing dissatisfaction with the status quo in Ukraine. Russia does not want to “freeze” the conflict it has fueled, but force further change. But while Russia remains publicly committed to the Minsk agreements — which according to its interpretation would federalize Ukraine and deepen Russian influence — it has no peaceful way to achieve this. Russia’s extraordinary decision, in breach of protocol, to publish recent correspondence with France and Germany suggests it is losing interest in diplomacy. Nor will its military buildup on Ukraine’s border by itself change minds in Berlin, Paris or Washington, let alone in Kiev. Russia’s only option is therefore a new military escalation. This would incur significant casualties and severe economic and financial sanctions. Yet Western leaders cannot assume that Putin weighs the risks as they might do in his shoes. His recent 5,000-word essay “On the historical unity of Russians and Ukrainians” points to ambitions that extend well beyond the matters addressed in the Minsk Agreements. Lukashenko’s struggle for survival and Putin’s designs on Ukraine are not only destabilising but connected. Despite their difficult relationship, Putin has a compelling interest in supporting Lukashenko: A free Belarus would not only seek better relations with the EU and Ukraine, but present the threat of a democratic example to Russia, as Ukraine’s revolutions in 2004 and 2014 did. Joint paratrooper exercises near the Polish border, Russia’s symbolic support with nuclear bomber overflights and the precedent of Russia’s own fabricated migrant crisis against Norway and Finland in 2015-16 all point to links between Russian and Belarusian policies.  Russia will also study reactions to Belarus’s actions to gauge Western resolve. Recent events have already produced significant effects. First, they show that Belarus and Russia can seize the initiative, threaten the status quo and precipitate crises that quickly become militarized. Second, they pose fresh tests for sanctions, a key Western policy tool. New EU measures seek to close down the complex supply chain of travel agencies, visa services and flights that enables Belarus to turn migrant misery into a novel form of de facto aggression against its neighbours. The West also seeks to use the prospect of severe future sanctions against Russia to avert a new invasion of Ukraine. Third, they mark the latest phase in a concerted Russian campaign of pressure against Europe that began soon after the Biden administration took office. In February, Russia threatened to cut off relations with the EU and humiliated High Representative Josep Borrell during his visit to Moscow. In April it conducted a massive troop buildup on Ukraine’s border. Last month it refused to supply extra gas to alleviate a temporary shortage, while suggesting that final approval of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline would resolve this. Russia could have reassured Europe of its reliability as a supplier by offering additional volumes — a smart move that might have eased Nord Stream 2 approval. Putin instead chose pressure over reassurance. He has since told the Foreign Ministry that Russia’s recent actions have produced a “certain tension” that “should be maintained as long as possible.” There is little sign that Russia seeks the “stable and predictable” relationship that America hopes for, and still less that Belarus will cease causing trouble for Europe.  On the contrary, a volatile mix of revanchism, insecurity, irrationality and military force is fueling tension and turbulence in the region. At worst, this could lead to the most serious crisis in Russian-Western relations in 40 years.",1,732,88.95,32.38,36.76,2.62,19.26,31.83,78.55,55.33,43.03,6.15,1.91,0,0,0,1.09,0.68,4.23,13.52,7.38,2.46,14.07,5.6,2.46,6.69,0.96,8.74,9.29,4.23,8.2,0.68,0.96,6.69,10.93,0.55,10.38,1.91,1.91,1.64,1.23,0,3.14,0,7.24,2.32,4.92,1.23,0.14,1.09,0.27,0.27,0,0,6.83,3.28,0.14,0,1.37,0.27,0.55,2.73,0,0,0,1.09,4.92,3.14,1.64,0.14,2.87,0.27,0.14,2.05,0.41,0.14,0.14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.14,0.82,0.27,0.14,0.27,0.14,0,0,1.91,0,3.01,9.56,0.82,0.96,6.97,0.27,0,0.55,6.01,1.5,3.28,1.37,0,0,0,0,0,14.07,5.19,4.92,0,0,2.05,1.91

Slaps Sanctions on Another Nord Stream 2 Firm,English,Russia,"The United States on Monday slapped sanctions on another company involved in the controversial Russia-Germany Nord Stream 2 pipeline even as it stops short of more drastic steps. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the United States was imposing sanctions on Transadria Ltd., a shipping company linked to Russia, as well as two vessels. President Joe Biden's administration took the action as part of a required report to Congress on action against the pipeline, which Ukraine and other Eastern European states fear will embolden Moscow and reduce their leverage. But Biden has waived sanctions on the main company behind Nord Stream, concluding that the pipeline will go ahead anyway and that it is better to work with Germany. ""Even as the administration continues to oppose the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, including via our sanctions, we continue to work with Germany and other allies and partners to reduce the risks posed by the pipeline,"" Blinken said in a statement. Germany, in a deal with the Biden administration, agreed to economic support to Ukraine on transitioning to clean energy and said it would insist that Russia keep gas flowing through its neighbor. The administration's approach has found wide opposition in the US Congress, with one Republican senator citing the issue to hold up State Department nominations.

Politicians in Europe have accused Moscow of withholding gas supplies in an attempt to accelerate approval for the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which links Russian gas fields to Germany via a mega pipeline under the Baltic Sea. Moscow says it is not manipulating the market and has pushed Europe to strike long-term supply deals with Gazprom if it wants to guarantee extra supplies. The company, Russia’s monopoly gas exporter, booked no additional transit capacity on either of the main transit routes to Europe through Belarus and Ukraine for the month of December, Russia’s state-run TASS news agency reported, citing data from European gas infrastructure operators. It was the third consecutive month of Gazprom booking no additional capacity on the routes, meaning the company could be intending to ship only the minimum amount of contracted supplies to the continent. Gazprom says its decisions over whether to book extra capacity are dictated by purchase agreements from gas buyers. Flows through Ukraine and Belarus have traditionally accounted for more than three-quarters of Gazprom’s supplies to the EU. However the company favors the Nord Stream pipeline, which does not incur high transit fees. The original Nord Stream, which started pumping gas in 2011, has accounted for 30% of Gazprom’s exports this year, according to Sova Capital, and is the only major transit route which has seen supply levels stable at maximum capacity throughout the year. European gas prices rose 10% in response to Gazpom not booking extra capacity through Ukraine and Belarus for December, with spot prices for gas still running at more than five times last year’s level. According to its own data, Gazprom has started to increase supplies to Europe in recent days, following a months-long process of replenishing storage facilities in Russia. Supplies to Europe were up 14% in the second week of November compared to the first week of the month. “​​We are starting to see the promised increase in flows to Europe, as well as some positive momentum in European underground storage. However, exports to Europe still lag in terms of flows versus historic levels,” said Sova Capital energy analyst Mitch Jennings. Gazprom’s gas exports to Europe are down by around 9% this year compared to the record supply year of 2018. But that comes against surging demand for power and after exports set all-time highs at the start of 2021, thus exacerbating the supply crunch which has hit markets this fall. Gazprom’s refusal to book additional transit capacity for December will keep the issue of Russia’s energy relations with Europe under the spotlight. It also comes at a time when Gazprom’s gas sales to China are surging. Shipments through the Power of Siberia pipeline, which connects Siberian gas fields to China’s energy network, are running 30% above contracted levels, the company said Monday. German regulators are currently assessing the recently completed Nord Stream 2 pipeline before it can be put into use. Officials said Monday they would consult Ukraine, which says it stands to lose $2 billion a year in transit fees from the pipeline, during that process. Russia says it is ready to start pumping gas as soon as it is given permission, and is eyeing a launch in early 2022.",1,566,97.41,18.67,60.68,18.15,25.73,30.04,74.2,54.77,41.87,4.24,0.35,0,0.18,0,0,0.18,3.89,10.42,7.07,3.18,18.9,4.95,2.47,4.24,0.88,10.95,4.42,6.36,3.53,0.18,0.35,3,7.42,0.71,6.36,0.53,0.88,0.71,0.18,0.35,3.89,0,1.59,0.71,0.88,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.42,3.18,0.18,0,0.53,0.18,1.94,0.35,0,0,0,0,1.24,0.35,0.88,0,6.18,0,0,4.24,2.3,0,0.53,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.18,0.35,0,0.88,0,0.18,0.18,0,3,9.89,0,2.65,7.07,0.53,0,0.18,6.18,2.47,5.65,0.88,0,0,0,0,0,12.37,3.89,4.42,0,0,1.77,2.3

The scenario is of 100 battalion tactical groups (BTGs) — the combined-arms mechanized units Russian army brigades generate to project force into conflict zones — or perhaps 90,000 troops, sweeping into Ukraine along multiple axes from Russia, Belarus and Crimea, in a massive strike supported by devastating airpower and long-range strikes. This would certainly be a major incursion and the implication is that it would have the objective of seizing large areas of territory or otherwise delivering a crippling blow to Ukrainian sovereignty. After all, Russia has almost 170 BTGs in permanent readiness overall, so this would represent almost two-thirds of its entire contingent. Yet buried amidst the assessment of a planned January or February assault is a crucial variable. As Bloomberg reported: The U.S. has shared intelligence including maps with European allies that shows a buildup of Russian troops and artillery to prepare for a rapid, large-scale push into Ukraine from multiple locations if President Vladimir Putin decided to invade, according to people familiar with the conversations. Quite. ‘If.’ The problem is that it is much easier to quantify capability than intent. Although there have been suggestions that this current troop build-up is being carried out more secretively than in spring, that really just means that the Russians are not making a media spectacle of it. That deployment — however much some prophesied an imminent invasion then, too — was much more clearly a political gesture. However, Moscow is well aware that the movement of thousands of troops and their associated armored vehicles, encampments and fuel bowsers can hardly be kept secret in an age of satellite surveillance and electronic eavesdropping. Forces are on the move, but so far nothing to explain the pitch of the American language (which implies they are working from some secret intelligence). Even according to Ukrainian military intelligence (GUR), there are only 40 BTGs currently around its borders, up from October’s tally, but lower than September’s (51), let alone April’s (53). That’s fewer than 40,000 soldiers — a BTG typically has a complement of 700-900 — although GUR chief Kyrylo Budanov claimed the total figure was actually 92,000. Even so, that is hardly the kind of superiority needed to take on a Ukrainian army that is now seasoned and well-trained and a quarter of a million strong, most of whom are in the Ground Forces. They may lack the higher-end capabilities of the Russians, but they would also be defending their homeland, and would be supplemented by volunteers and militias. It certainly isn’t the kind of force which could guarantee a quick and easy victory, and any attempt directly to take cities against collective local resistance — something the Russian army has never done in Ukraine — would be especially bloody. There is no way that the High Command cannot know that there would be many soldiers coming home crippled, wounded, or as ‘Cargo 200s’ — the dead. Nonetheless, if need be, the Russians could certainly build up a commanding force around Ukraine, and if Putin is willing to brave the international sanctions and condemnation and domestic outrage such a bloody war would generate, then an invasion can go ahead. But would it? Everyone knows what the Kremlin plans… With no way of knowing for sure what the Kremlin intends, observers tend to default to their operating assumptions. For those convinced Putin is an implacable foe of Ukrainian statehood, of course he is willing to pay any price to crush his foes. For those who see the most serious threat coming from Western warmongering, the U.S. position is simply making war more likely. One can frame an argument that says that Putin, eager to avoid further delegitimising his regime before the 2024 elections, would avoid such a war. One can frame one that says a war is how he would try to re-legitimate it. Focus on military balances of power and one can argue that, if Putin really does fear Ukraine’s westward drift and, especially, the danger that NATO forces would begin to be emplaced in the country – as he mused during his recent Valdai appearance, “what if missiles are stationed near Kharkov some day” under the guise of training bases? – then he may feel that delay will only make an eventual strike harder. Better to move sooner than later. Then again, maybe this is all another piece of political theatre to try and force Kiev to negotiate with Moscow on its terms, as Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council Secretary Oleksiy Danilov put it ‘to raise the table stakes of future talks.’ …Except the Kremlin The bottom line is that we do not know, and probably nor does the Kremlin. We are back to the usual metaphor of the opportunistic judoka versus the methodical chess grandmaster. This Russian administration does not tend to work on rigid, long term plans of the sort intended to bring about checkmate in 15 moves. Instead, it generates dynamic situations — which often means disrupting the status quo — and creates options for itself, so that it can seize opportunities and respond to threats as they arise. When the Russians built up their troops in spring, it was in part a rebuke and a warning to Kiev, and also a chance to see what concessions they might be able to extort. It’s highly unlikely they specifically had a summit meeting with President Biden in mind, but when that arose, they were happy to take the deal and stand down. Likewise, Putin probably has no clear and definite plan for 2022. It may be that there will be a war, although a full-scale invasion still seems an unlikely and dangerous move for a man who tends actually to be risk-averse. Alternatively, there may be some new talks — Minsk III? — or some quiet concessions. Or nothing may happen at all. The virtue of this kind of ambiguous menace is that it allows the Kremlin this option without having to look as if it is climbing down. Of course, if this happens then those crying ‘war!’ today can claim that it was only their vigilance and vehemence that made Moscow blink, just as the lack of an invasion in spring was presented as evidence of the power of the threat of sanctions, with equally little evidence. That will, however, be a small price to pay for avoiding another potential, bloody escalation.",1,1125,67.24,27,32.09,10.53,23.94,26.13,86.67,66.31,54.04,8.36,2.22,0,0.27,0,0.62,1.07,6.13,15.56,8.09,1.69,14.22,9.07,6.22,8.09,1.24,14.84,7.47,4,8.18,1.24,1.6,5.51,18.31,1.16,16.8,2.13,2.04,2.76,4.44,1.33,5.16,0,4.27,1.6,2.58,0.62,0.09,0.44,0.09,0.27,0.09,0.27,8,4,0.36,0,0.98,0.36,1.33,4,0,0,0,0.71,3.47,1.78,1.6,0.09,2.13,0.18,0.18,1.33,0.36,0.09,0.27,0.18,0.09,0.09,0,0,0,0,0.09,0.44,0,0.36,0.18,0,0,0.27,1.16,0.18,3.02,8.8,0.53,1.96,6.04,0.62,0.09,0.18,3.64,1.6,5.69,1.87,0,0,0,0,0,14.22,4.44,5.42,0.36,0.09,1.33,2.58

Moldova and Gazprom extended a deal to supply gas to the ex-Soviet country at the end of last month.  The deal was reached after a bitter stand-off that saw Chisinau declare a state of emergency over gas shortages and sign a gas contract with a country other than Russia for the first time.  On October 29, both sides said they agreed to extend their previous agreement by five years, with deliveries starting on November 1.  Kupryanov said Gazprom had signed a contract ""practically on the terms of the Moldovan side"", but on one condition: ""that Moldova completes one percent of its payments on time.""  He added that Gazprom was ""extremely disappointed with Moldova's failure to fulfil its contractual obligations.""

Talk of a possible military confrontation between Russia and Ukraine has escalated in recent days, with Bloomberg reporting that U.S. intelligence has warned European allies a Russian invasion “on a scale far greater than seven years ago” could be “imminent.” The RTS Index — Russia’s main stock market, denominated in U.S. dollars — was down 4% by Monday afternoon, wiping billions off the valuations of Russia’s top companies. Banks were among the biggest fallers — seen as vulnerable to a devaluation in the ruble or introduction of new sanctions against Russia’s financial markets — along with energy giant Gazprom. The Russian ruble lost 1.1% against the U.S. dollar, trading at 74.4 — its lowest since August. The currency was down by a similar amount against the euro. Traders are also mulling the potential for a new round of sanctions against Russia. Over the weekend, the chair of the powerful U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee proposed a legislative amendment that could see strict new financial sanctions levied against Moscow. The declines wiped out three months of gains that had seen Russian stocks trading at all-time highs. Until recently Russian stock markets had been among investors’ top picks in emerging markets, as traders pointed to record-high valuations in the U.S. as signs of a possible bubble and a period of relative calm in Russia’s relations with the West following the Geneva summit between Presidents Vladimir Putin and Joe Biden.

Around 110 countries have been invited to the virtual summit, including the United States' major Western allies, and snubbing Russia and China. The long-advertised meeting will take place online on Dec. 9 and 10 ahead of an in-person meeting at its second gathering next year. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the guest list, released Tuesday on the State Department website, showed that Washington ""prefers to create new dividing lines, to divide countries into those that — in their opinion — are good, and those that are bad."" ""More and more countries prefer to decide themselves how to live,"" Peskov told reporters, adding that Washington is ""trying to privatize the term 'democracy'."" The list of invitees from the former Soviet world includes Ukraine, Moldova, Armenia and Georgia as well as the three Baltic states that are now members of the European Union and NATO. Biden, who has made the struggle between democracies and ""autocratic governments"" a focal point of his foreign policy, pledged to hold the global conference during the 2020 presidential campaign. Russia’s snub comes amid tensions on multiple fronts between the two nuclear powers, with Washington blaming Moscow for a wave of cyberattacks, diplomat expulsions and election meddling.

France has been spearheading moves to target Wagner after its reported deal with Mali's military junta to send 1,000 contractors to help in a longstanding conflict with jihadists. West African regional group ECOWAS earlier this month slapped sanctions on individual members of the military junta ruling Mali since the August 2020 seizure of power.

In the letter, dated April 20, 1787, and addressed to a count, the German-born ruler who expanded Russia's territory provides detailed instructions to authorities in present-day Ukraine on how to organize an effective inoculation campaign. Auction house MacDougall's, which specializes in Russian art, put the letter and a portrait of Catherine on public display in Moscow on Friday before the pieces go on sale in London. The document and portrait are estimated to have a joint worth of up to $1.6 million. Held until now in an anonymous private collection, they will be shown at a Moscow gallery until Nov. 30 and will go up for auction in London on Dec. 1. ""One of the most important (tasks) should be the introduction of inoculation against smallpox, which, as we know, causes great harm, especially among ordinary people,"" Catherine wrote to Count Pyotr Rumyantsev, reportedly on a trip to Crimea. ""Such inoculation should be common everywhere,"" she wrote in neat Cyrillic, signing ""Catherine"" in large script. She goes on to provide details on how to make vaccinations widely available, including by setting up temporary accommodation in monasteries for those who fall ill after being jabbed. The Empress was the first person in Russia to be vaccinated against smallpox. ""In today's conditions, we should be very proud of Catherine,"" the auction house's co-director and Russian art expert Yekaterina MacDougall told reporters during a press viewing on Thursday. While President Vladimir Putin says he was vaccinated with Russia's home-grown Sputnik V vaccine, he took months into the pandemic to do so – and some have criticized him for not doing so on camera. The Empress had organized an ""unreal"" propaganda campaign to encourage her subjects to be jabbed against smallpox, which was decimating populations across Europe at the time. But, ""as a very intelligent woman,"" MacDougall said Catherine stopped short of mandating vaccinations. ""She knew that the Russian people would rebel against this."" During the Covid-19 pandemic, many Russians have also rebelled against Kremlin instructions, refusing to vaccinate themselves against the virus. Despite repeated pleas from Putin, only 40% of Russians are fully vaccinated. Catherine's letter is ""unique, especially given this situation we are all in,"" historian Oleg Khromov told reporters via video link, adding that it was a ""miracle"" that it had survived. Catherine, scared of dying of smallpox like many around her, had a doctor come from England to give her the smallpox vaccine. Khromov said doctors used a sample from a child to inject Catherine with the disease. The youngster was later rewarded with a title. She was then sick for some time and when she recovered, imperial authorities put out a decree saying the Empress was feeling well and urged others to follow her. But Khromov said that despite her efforts to convince Russians to get vaccinated, ""people were scared, it was new and unusual.""

Among those classified by Russia as extremist and banned are the Christian group Jehovah's Witnesses and the Muslim group Hizb ut-Tahrir. Tensions between the United States and Russia have increased recently despite upbeat declarations made by leaders Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin at a June summit in Geneva. Washington has recently warned Moscow over military activities near Ukraine and over its alleged influence in the Belarus-Poland border crisis — as well as Russia's ""dangerous and irresponsible"" strike on a satellite.

The ruble sank 2% against major currencies by Friday lunchtime in Moscow trading, hitting a seven-month low of 75.7 against the U.S. dollar and 85.2 against the euro.  The sell-off caps a punishing week for Russian markets, which started with what traders have dubbed “black Monday” — a day of heavy losses prompted by fears of military confrontation between Russia and Ukraine.  Russia’s stock market has now lost 16% over the past four weeks.  Several countries have restricted travel to South Africa and a number of other African countries, where the new strain of the coronavirus, named “Nu,” was first discovered.  Scientists say the new variant has more mutations on the virus’ protein spike than even the highly-transmissible Delta variant, prompting fears it could be better able to evade vaccines and extend the pandemic.  Russia’s main stock market, the dollar-denominated RTS index, slumped by more than 4% in the first hours of trading Friday as investors took stock of the news and potential impact on the global economy. Russia followed other major markets lower, with the main stock indices in London and Frankfurt also down by more than 3%. Traders in the U.S. are also braced for big losses when markets open later Friday.  In Russia, commodities companies were the biggest fallers, heading lower after a 5% fall in the price of oil, as traders fear travel restrictions and new lockdowns could be on the way.  South Africa is on Russia’s list of countries with which air travel has been restored following a complete closure of Russia’s borders at the start of the coronavirus pandemic last year. The Russian Embassy in South Africa said Friday it was following the situation, but was not advising Russians to stop travelling to the country, the state-run TASS news agency reported. The Kremlin has previously shut down travel to virus hot spots and areas where new variants have been discovered, banning flights to Britain following the discovery of the Alpha strain last December, for instance.

The pipeline, which was completed earlier this year after months of delays and setbacks amid U.S. sanctions designed to thwart it, needs approval from German authorities before it can be put into use. The German regulator said it could not proceed with certification of the pipeline because Nord Stream 2 AG, the Gazprom-controlled company which owns the pipeline, is registered in Switzerland, not Germany. “Following a thorough examination of the documentation, the Bundesnetzagentur concluded that it would only be possible to certify an operator of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline if that operator was organised in a legal form under German law,” the regulator said in a statement Tuesday. Gazprom’s share price dropped 2% on the news, which comes as Europe faces a gas supply crunch, with Russia accused of withholding supplies in a bid to force approval for Nord Stream 2. Nord Stream 2 AG has agreed to set up a German subsidiary to govern the German part of the pipeline, the regulator said in its statement. “The certification procedure will remain suspended until the main assets and human resources have been transferred to the subsidiary.” Once that process is completed, the certification period will resume. Under German law, the regulator has four months to review documentation and make a decision on whether to approve the pipeline. It is the latest setback for Nord Stream 2, which has been beset with delays and hold-ups in recent years amid escalating tensions between Russia and the West. The pipeline has been heavily criticized by many European countries, including key German ally France, as well as Poland and the Baltic States, who see it as a Russian geopolitical weapon. Washington’s hostility to the project drove a wedge between the U.S. and Germany under the Donald Trump administration. New U.S. President Joe Biden struck a deal earlier this year with Germany to drop opposition to the project, with Germany pledging to support Ukraine, which stands to lose up to $2 billion a year in lucrative transit fees. The new pipeline, which connects Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea runs alongside the existing Nord Stream gas link. When launched, the two pipelines could account for 60% of Russia’s gas exports to Europe. European spot prices for gas — already elevated amid a supply crunch across the continent — jumped a further 5% on the news.",1,414,98.63,26.92,37.9,14.89,25.88,28.02,74.88,53.14,43.72,4.59,0.24,0,0,0,0,0,4.35,14.73,12.08,3.38,16.67,5.07,1.45,4.35,0.48,9.18,4.11,2.66,6.52,0.48,1.45,4.59,6.04,0,6.04,0.97,0.97,1.21,0.48,0,2.66,0,2.42,0.97,1.45,0.24,0,0.24,0,0.24,0,0,3.86,3.14,0.48,0,1.21,0.24,1.21,0.72,0,0.24,0,0,3.86,1.45,2.42,0,6.04,0,0,4.83,1.45,0,0.24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.24,0,0,0,0.48,0,0.24,0.24,0,1.45,9.18,0,1.93,6.76,0.24,0,0.48,5.31,4.59,2.9,0.48,0,0,0,0,0,13.77,5.31,4.83,0,0,1.21,2.42

Around 2,000 people, mainly from the Middle East, are estimated to be living near the Poland-Belarus border in dire conditions and desperate to cross into the European Union. The EU says Belarus engineered the crisis in retaliation for sanctions on the ex-Soviet country. Minsk and its main ally Russia have rejected the charges and criticized the EU for not taking in the migrants seeking to cross over. ""We call on the regime to cease immediately its aggressive and exploitative campaign,"" the EU and foreign ministers of the G7 global powers said. But Belarus has said it wants to de-escalate the crisis. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's spokeswoman Natalya Eismont said on Thursday that there were currently around 7,000 migrants in the country. She said Belarus will send 5,000 of the migrants home, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel will negotiate with the EU on creating ""a humanitarian corridor to Germany"" for the 2,000 on the border. There was no immediate reaction from Germany. A repatriation flight with between 200 and 300 migrants on board took off from Belarus on Thursday bound for Erbil in Iraqi Kurdistan and Baghdad. The flight traveling to Baghdad is carrying 431 people, Russia's Interfax news agency reported. In the latest border incident, the Polish defense ministry said that Belarusian forces had first carried out reconnaissance and ""most likely"" damaged the barbed wire fence along the border. ""Then the Belarusians forced the migrants to throw stones at Polish soldiers to distract them. The attempt to cross the border took place several hundred meters away,"" it said. ""Belarusian special forces led yesterday's attack,"" it said. The border guard said a total of around 500 migrants took part in the attempted crossing and 200 of them were detained after crossing into Poland successfully. It said a family of five people, including three children aged between seven and nine, had been injured in the incident and were taken to hospital. Video footage released by the defense ministry appeared to show Polish soldiers surrounding a large group of migrants crouched down in a wooded area at night next to barbed wire. The incident could not be independently verified as journalists are banned from the immediate border area on the Polish side. Lukashenko, who has cracked down on political opponents and independent media for nearly three decades, has spoken twice to Merkel about the crisis in recent days. Lukashenko's press service on Wednesday said the Belarus leader and Merkel ""agreed that the problem as a whole will be brought up to the level of Belarus and the EU."" The Polish government has warned against any agreement on the crisis that might be struck ""over our heads."" Poland's state-run TVP network also on Thursday began broadcasting a new English-language channel TVP World, bringing forward the launch to ""show the whole world the truth"" about the migrant crisis on the Poland-Belarus border. Meanwhile British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said he would stand ""shoulder to shoulder"" with Poland during a visit to a military base in northeast Poland that hosts a NATO battlegroup. A squadron of British military engineers is expected in Poland later this month to help with border fencing and repairing roads in the area, Polish Defense Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said. Aid groups say at least 11 migrants have died since the crisis began in the summer. Polish medical workers said they had assisted a Syrian couple in the early hours of Thursday who had been in the forest for one and a half months. ""Their one-year-old child died in the forest,"" the Polish Center for International Aid said on Twitter. In another incident, video footage released by Belarusian border guards showed a Lithuanian border guard dog biting a man lying on the ground in a sleeping bag. Lithuania's boder guard admitted to the incident, saying that they were attempting to push back a group of migrants into Belarus and that the border guard did not see the migrant.

It’s become unhelpful at best and dangerous at worst, both in terms of understanding what Belarus is doing and the wider issue of Russia’s role in the neighborhood and beyond. Since the summer, Belarus has been enabling migrants, mostly from the Middle East, to travel through the country, huddling them up against the Polish border, even as President Alexander Lukashenko threatened to bring a migrant crisis to his neighbour’s doorstep. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki called Vladimir Putin the mastermind of the crisis, with officials and commentators widely describing the standoff as part of Putin’s “hybrid warfare” playbook. But not only does this language hobble our ability to really do anything about this human tragedy, let alone make sense of it. The very rhetoric of war risks bringing war closer. Ultimately, we cannot know what goes on in the conversations between Putin and his client Lukashenko and our feeble attempts to ascribe intent are based on conjecture. This week, Belarus restricted oil through the Druzhba pipeline to Poland and it emerged that Lukashenko, in his phone call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, allegedly demanded recognition and an end to sanctions in exchange for ending the crisis. Are all of these things, the migrants, the threats, the oil restrictions, part of some grand, coordinated onslaught managed from Moscow, or simply a series of retaliations for sanctions by a wavering dictator with no clear plan? The move to restrict oil really put Russian pipeline monopoly Transneft on the spot. In his statement, the company’s representatives called the Belarus repairs “unscheduled,” in effect distancing itself from this decision. The Kremlin, of course, is silent. Which doesn’t mean it’s pleased. That means literally: it may not necessarily mean anything at all. To know means to presume that Lukashenko knows exactly what he’s doing, that he approved this decision with Moscow, and that there’s some kind of reasonable plan. I’m not so certain. After all, Putin has warned against Minsk threatening to cut off oil and gas supplies to Europe as a move that will risk the already shaky relations between Russia and Belarus. More to the point, Lukashenko has a history of threatening Moscow as well. Let’s assume that Lukashenko and Putin are coordinating all these actions and statements, and especially that it’s part of a larger power play against European countries that also, absurdly, includes Russian troop build up on the Ukrainian border — but to achieve what, exactly? End sanctions? That scenario presumes a Kremlin that is either incredibly stupid or exceedingly smart, and that it’s adopted a strategy of three-dimensional chess that would make anyone’s head spin, and that its relations with Lukashenko are seamless and trustworthy. But none of these things are true. In my 20 years of writing about Russian foreign policy, I have yet to witness Putin thinking more than two steps ahead. Chess is probably the worst analogy for Putin’s behavior on the world stage, let alone for Lukashenko, who has a history of angering everyone around him, including Putin, without any clear plan. Perhaps Lukashenko had something of a plan prior to August 2020, when a particularly rigged election sparked mass protests and repressions that ultimately stripped the leader of much of his legitimacy. Until then he had been playing bait and switch with Moscow, oscillating between the Russians and the West in attempts to haggle out some choice energy subsidies from Russia. If it was a strategy, it failed because Moscow itself ultimately got tired of his unreliability and cut back on the subsidies. Since then, supporting Lukashenko has been a chore for the Kremlin, but a chore it can’t seem to let up precisely because when U.S. and EU officials and commentators make irresponsible comments tying up Lukashenko and Putin in some kind of wholesale “hybrid war” against the west it only vindicates Kremlin paranoias. Alas, Mark Galeotti has been one of the few voices to make the obvious point that making Putin responsible for Lukashenko has the effect of pushing them together. But I would also argue that our very fixation on the term “hybrid war” to describe what is happening is making the problem worse, and muddling what is actually going on. Do Lukashenko’s actions theoretically constitute hybrid warfare? Possibly. Maybe. Likely. But here’s the problem. What is even a hybrid war? Simply put, it is being nasty to your neighbor or another country by using non-military means together with military ones. By definition, most wars are hybrid wars in that they involve propaganda, diplomacy or politics. But the non-kinetic, non-conventional components of a hybrid war — disinformation, lawfare, political shenanigans, even political destabilization campaigns — also happen outside of the state which we commonly regard as war. We are in effect describing peacetime behavior as war, implicitly suggesting that kinetic aggression is the next stage in the plan. What could possibly go wrong? The recent hybrid war fad emerged when Russian military officials started talking about it as something that the United States was doing to Russia and other countries. It then deployed hybrid tactics in Ukraine to counter what it believed was a Western hybrid war. In other words, hybrid war emerged as a talking point of Russian propaganda. While it may be useful to look at what Russia did in Ukraine in 2014 through the lens of hybridity, I don’t believe that everything Russia has been doing since then constitutes some kind of wholesale hybrid war against the West. To say so, we are in effect parroting and amplifying Russian propaganda. We have become locked in a vicious and dangerous feedback loop by qualifying every selfish and nasty thing that Russia or its allies do as part of “hybrid war.” Russia is doing the same. The result is political escalation and the increasing fear, if not threat, of real war, as Leonid Ragozin wrote in bne IntelliNews. How about we all stop? As journalists, analysts, and policymakers, isn’t it our job to make sense of facts, and to avert, rather than exacerbate, crises? And not to write screenplays for future Netflix war epics? While it has its uses, the hybrid war concept has already been coming under criticism by scholars. But its damage lies outside the academe. Its (ab)use by officials and pundits who see an all-powerful Putin lurking around every corner, of a grand plan to destroy western values every time a dictator does something nasty, amounts only to epic that deflects from the difficult and often boring work needed to solve serious problems that demagogues everywhere — and yes, that also includes the Polish Prime Minister — love to politically exploit. When it comes to Russia, its role in potentially helping solve this particular crisis is more limited than many tend to assume. Putting pressure on Russia over Lukashenko will only backfire. But drawing it into talks — while offering something in return — may offer a limited benefit. Putin has offered to mediate the crisis and, to an extent, may already be doing so. It may not entirely change Lukashenko’s behavior — the Kremlin’s brokering potential is ever more modest than it sometimes makes it out to be — but it may make it more difficult for him to get away with it. But to work, either Germany, the EU, or whatever body that will be brokering this mediation will need to discard its assumptions about some kind of Russian hybrid war against the West before it approaches Moscow. Contrary to the widely popular idea that Putin can stop Lukashenko whenever he wants, the reality is that forcing someone to do something is always hard, costly work. Moscow will obviously be looking for something in return. Russia may continue to believe whatever it wants about the West waging a hybrid war against it. It doesn’t mean that the EU and the U.S. have to continue believing the same.

The EU has accused the Belarusian government of shipping Middle Eastern migrants toward Poland to force the bloc to drop sanctions imposed after the disputed victory of longtime leader Alexander Lukashenko in presidential elections. Poland, in turn, says Russia, Belarus’s only major ally and key political and economic backer, orchestrated the crisis. But despite ongoing Russian support for Lukashenko, who faced down unprecedented protests against his 27-year rule over Belarus last year, analysts from the two countries cast doubt on the idea that Russia has contrived the migration crisis, saying Moscow’s position on its neighbor is complex and often contradictory. “I don’t think Lukashenko needed any push from Russia to act in this way,” said Artyom Shraibman, a Belarusian political analyst based in Ukraine. “He has been threatening to unleash the flow of migrants for many years before 2021.” “But then, if Moscow had wanted to stop Lukashenko, it could have done so,” added Shraibman. The roots of the present crisis go back to August 2020. When Lukashenko claimed a landslide victory in his bid for a sixth term in office, the opposition cried foul and Belarus was plunged into uproar. As security forces resorted to vicious violence to put down unprecedentedly large protests, the EU — in particular Belarus’s neighbors Poland and Lithuania — threw their weight behind Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, the opposition candidate who said she defeated Lukashenko at the polls. The aftermath of the election, which saw sanctions imposed on Belarus and Lukashenko rendered persona non grata in Europe, spelled the end of Minsk’s decades-long policy of balancing relations between Russia and Europe to extract concessions from both. Instead, Russian President Vladimir Putin, seeing in Lukashenko a guarantee that Belarus would not follow Ukraine in aligning with the West, stepped in offering economic and political support that proved crucial in thwarting the Belarusian protest movement. The result, however, was to leave Lukashenko, who had always jealously guarded his country’s independence, profoundly reliant on Putin, with whom he has reportedly had difficult personal relations. Among Russian experts, there is broad agreement that the migration crisis is Lukashenko’s bid to force Europe to talk to him, and therefore to lessen his dependence on Russia. “Throughout this crisis, Lukashenko has been trying to force the West into dialogue,” said Andrei Kortunov, head of the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC), a Kremlin-aligned think tank. Russia’s contradictory moves throughout the crisis — signaling support for Lukashenko with military drills in Belarus while also coordinating with European leaders to defuse the crisis — point to the Kremlin’s complex position on Belarus, which aims to keep Lukashenko in office while preventing him from resuming his traditional independence. “Lukashenko wants to put some distance between Minsk and Moscow and to increase his freedom for maneuver independent of Russia,” said Kortunov. “It would be strange if Putin supported him in that.” For some experts, Russia’s guarded support for Lukashenko reflects the Belarusian president’s own weakness, and the improbability of his scheme bearing fruit. “Russia doesn’t need to publicly abandon Lukashenko because the chances of him actually managing to force the EU to restore relations were always very minimal,” said Maxim Samorukov, a scholar of post-Communist Eastern Europe at the Moscow Carnegie Center. For Samorukov, Lukashenko’s continued pariah status in Europe means his migration gambit was never likely to achieve his goals. “It’s quite clear that a phone call with Merkel isn’t the same as sanctions relief, or a reset in relations,” he added, referring to Lukashenko’s call with the outgoing German chancellor this week, the first since his disputed re-election. With the EU unanimous in its support for Poland’s actions despite Warsaw’s strained relations with Brussels, and Middle Eastern countries shutting down flights to Minsk under EU pressure, some conclude that Lukashenko’s bid to force his neighbours into dealing with him has failed. “Lukashenko wanted the Europeans to realize what good relations with Belarus had given them in terms of border security,” said political analyst Shraibman. “I don’t think it has worked in the way he intended.” However, regardless of Lukashenko’s isolation, some Russian experts feel that the Belarusian strongman is becoming a liability for Moscow’s interests. “The main goal of Russian policy in Belarus isn’t to annex Belarus, but to make sure Belarus doesn’t move toward the West,” said Carnegie’s Samorukov. “On the one hand, Lukashenko is an iron-cast guarantee that won’t happen. But on the other, Russia also understands that Lukashenko’s behavior is itself becoming a risk factor.” It has not gone unnoticed in Moscow that the migration standoff is Lukashenko’s second self-inflicted crisis in a year. In May, the forced grounding of a Ryanair jet flying over Belarus and the arrest of an opposition journalist onboard provoked international outrage and led to Belarus’s transport links with the outside world being almost entirely severed. In the last week, experts have pointed to Lukashenko’s threat to shut off the Yamal pipeline, which carries Russian gas through Belarus to Europe, as particularly disturbing for Moscow at a time when gas supplies to the EU are a sensitive issue. Putin, in an interview with Russian state TV, publicly rebuked Lukashenko for the pipeline threat, dismissing his Belarusian ally as “overly emotional.” According to Samorukov, Lukashenko’s increasingly erratic conduct has the Kremlin set on a gradual, stage-managed transition of power in Minsk ahead of presidential elections scheduled for 2025. “There’s no need for him to go imminently, but everyone now understands that Lukashenko shouldn’t run for another term,” said Samorukov. “That would be the single biggest risk to Russian interests in Belarus.” With Lukashenko having publicly committed himself — with Russian endorsement — to an as-yet vague program of constitutional reform to be approved by referendum, some see a mechanism by which Belarus’s first and so far only president could formally retire, even while maintaining a degree of control over his country. “Every time you hear a Russian official talk about constitutional reform in Belarus, they’re saying that Lukashenko has to go,” said Samorukov.",1,1015,94.41,43.54,23.76,10.47,26.71,34.78,77.34,55.57,43.94,6.8,3.45,0.2,0,0.1,2.46,0.3,3.35,12.91,7.59,0.99,17.14,5.12,2.76,4.43,1.18,11.92,4.63,2.76,6.7,0.59,1.58,5.22,10.54,0.79,9.66,1.77,1.58,1.28,1.28,0.59,2.96,0,5.02,1.97,2.96,0.59,0.1,0.39,0,0.2,0.1,0,10.84,5.42,1.08,0,1.48,0.3,2.36,4.83,0,0.3,0.1,2.36,6.21,3.05,2.86,0.3,2.46,0.1,0.3,1.87,0.2,0,0.39,0.1,0,0.1,0,0,0,0.1,0,1.48,0.39,0.1,0,0,0,0.3,1.77,0.3,2.46,10.54,0.39,2.17,7.59,0.49,0.1,0.2,3.25,3.65,3.45,0.89,0,0,0,0,0,18.13,3.74,6.6,0,0,3.55,4.24

It did not surprise me to find three almost empty jars of adjika, which, alas, could not be combined, as they were all different. I threw the contents of the spiciest into a plastic bag of marinating pork, smeared the other on a grilled cheese sandwich for lunch, and mixed the third together with kefir and lemon juice to make salad dressing. And as I did so, it reminded me of how versatile and enjoyable adjika can be. But what is adjika exactly? I’ve heard adjika called everything from “Georgian pesto,” to “Russian salsa,” to “Kyrgyz harissa.” Adjika is none of these things, of course, though harissa is the closest analogy. Adjika is a chili paste, tempered with garlic, salt, and a few signature Caucasian spices. Though the Georgians have eagerly claimed this beloved regional condiment as their own, adjika is originally from Abkhazia, the autonomous republic of the South Caucasus, which, come to think of it, the Georgians also claim as their own. Adjika in Abkhaz means “salt,” and the condiment’s story begins with Abkhazian shepherds, who fed salt to their grazing sheep to increase their appetites and thus fatten them up. Because salt was an expensive commodity, the shepherds mixed it with the region’s ubiquitous red peppers, later adding wild herbs and garlic to the mixture. The best adjika is hand ground with stones, though today, most people take the straightforward route and use a food processor or meat grinder. Adjika’s appeal has spread far beyond the pasturelands of Abkhazia. The spicy, salty condiment was adopted (the Abkhazians might use the word “appropriated”) by the republic’s neighbors in the region, where adjika is a popular ingredient for soups, stews, and marinades, and an essential condiment, appearing on the table to liven up everything from a dish of beans to a full lamb roasted on a spit. As adjika traveled north through the vast Russian empire, it was further adapted with ingredients that no Caucasian would ever dream of including. In Ukraine, I have encountered “adjika” made with peppers, carrots, apples, honey, and tomatoes, while Russians add copious amounts of dill to a heavily tomato-based sauce and also call that adjika. Clearly across the years and kilometers, the word “adjika” has taken on a generic meaning for a piquant sauce or condiment. It is just as impossible to pin down a definitive, authoritative recipe for adjika as it is one for Pesto Genovese, but the essential ingredients are red peppers (both bell and chili), salt, garlic, coriander, blue fenugreek, and calendula or dried marigold flowers. The hottest, spiciest adjika, used predominantly in cooking, is heavy on the chili peppers and their seeds: a pepper’s heat comes from its seeds, so you can always gage the relative spiciness of adjika by the number of seeds in it. Milder versions of adjika are served at table as dips or spreads, the fire dampened by the exclusion of the seeds and a generous addition of walnuts. Green adjika is less common, perhaps because its key ingredients — green peppers and fresh herbs — are more perishable and thus more challenging to preserve and transport. But green adjika is no less delicious with its dominant notes of garlic and fresh herbs, making it a superb marinade for lamb, fish, and poultry. This is the adjika I turn to when all about me is cold, dark, and grey and I need a reminder of the bright sun and intoxicating air of the south. As we grapple with faulty supply chains throughout the world, increasingly I am setting myself the challenge of making things from scratch, particularly essentials I used to pick up at retail outlets or buy online. And so it is now with adjika, which I always want to have on hand. There are so many things this versatile sauce/condiment can do, from livening up a bowl of cottage cheese to marinating pork. Pair it with leftover roast turkey or chicken as a marvelous zingy note or slather it on a well-grilled steak instead of garlic butter. I love to serve mild adjika as a dip on its own or swirled around a bowl of hummus or labneh. It is a marvelous addition to a charcuterie board, an omelet, tucked inside a pita sandwich, or on top of a side dish of grains. Stuff jacket potatoes with either one of the adjikas listed below, or dip small meatballs in a shallow bowl of either of these versions of Abkhazia’s incomparable condiment. However you choose to enjoy them, may they bring sunshine and warmth to you! *Note: This milder version or adjika is primarily used as a spread rather than a sauce. Its distinctly orange color comes from the calendula or dried marjoram leaves and the addition of walnuts. Ingredients Preparation Ingredients Preparation Recipe Notes *Removing the seeds from hot peppers will make the condiment less fiery. You may wish to use protective gloves for this step and be very careful of touching your face with your hands when working with spicy peppers. ** Blue fenugreek and calendula are available from online retailers. Both are essential for that authentic aroma of the Caucuses.",1,901,84.62,22.07,22.65,49.04,24.35,22.86,78.47,63.26,50.94,8.44,3.77,1.89,0.11,0.67,0,1,4.66,14.32,9.1,0.44,15.65,5.44,4.44,8.99,0.55,9.77,8.21,3.77,1.55,0.44,0.55,0.55,10.77,1.22,9.32,1.11,1.66,0.89,2,0.78,4,0.22,2.44,2.11,0.22,0.33,0.22,0,0,0,0,0,3.77,1.44,0.11,0,0,0.11,0.55,2.22,0,0,0,0,1,0.22,0.55,0.22,1,0,0.33,0.55,0.33,0,7.33,0.22,0,0,0,0.11,0,6.55,0,0.55,0.22,0.44,0.11,0.22,0,0.11,0.22,0.11,3.66,9.32,0.11,1.22,5.33,1.44,0.11,1.11,1.33,2.11,3.88,0.89,0.11,0,0.11,0,0,15.54,3.88,7.66,0.11,0.11,0.78,3

Warns Russia of  High - Impact  Sanctions If It Invades Ukraine,English,Russia,"U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that Washington had seen ""evidence"" Russia could be planning an invasion of Ukraine, threatening Moscow with painful economic sanctions if it attacks. Blinken accused Moscow of massing ""tens of thousands of additional combat forces"" near Ukraine's border as he geared up for talks with Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Stockholm over the crisis. ""We're deeply concerned by evidence that Russia has made plans for significant aggressive moves against Ukraine, plans include efforts to destabilise Ukraine from within as well as large scale military operations,"" he said after a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Latvia's capital Riga. ""Now, we don't know whether President (Vladimir) Putin has made the decision to invade. We do know that he's putting in place the capacity to do so on short order, should he so decide,"" he said. Blinken insisted ""diplomacy is the only responsible way to resolve this potential crisis"" but warned there would be ""far-reaching and long-lasting consequences"" for Moscow if it pushed ahead with any aggression. ""We made it clear to the Kremlin that we will respond resolutely, including with a range of high-impact economic measures that we've refrained from using in the past,"" Blinken said. Kiev's Western allies have been sounding the alarm since last month over a fresh Russian troop buildup around Ukraine's borders and a possible winter invasion. Russia, which seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and backs separatists fighting Kiev, has strongly denied it is plotting an attack and blames NATO for fuelling tensions. Moscow on Wednesday hit back by accusing Ukraine of massing tens of thousands of troops in the country's east, as worries grow over an escalation. The allegations came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for direct talks with Moscow over the festering conflict with Russian-backed separatists in the east of his country. ""We must tell the truth that we will not be able to end the war without direct talks with Russia,"" Zelensky said during an annual address to lawmakers in Kiev. More than 13,000 people have been killed in a war that began in 2014 between Ukraine and pro-Russian separatists, who have carved out two ""People's Republics"" in eastern Ukraine. In Moscow, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov appeared to pour cold water on the idea, reiterating that the war was a domestic problem in Ukraine. ""We know of attempts to present Russia as a party to this conflict. This is not the case,"" Peskov told reporters. ""The war in Donbass can only be stopped through negotiations between Ukrainians and Ukrainians."" A senior U.S. official on Wednesday urged a ""complete ceasefire"" on the Donbass conflict over Christmas. ""With the Christmas season coming, this is a time for a resumption of complete ceasefire, for prisoner exchange and for re-opening of crossing points so that families can visit,"" Victoria Nuland, the U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs told a security forum in Kiev via a video link. ""We have been encouraging both Moscow and Kiev to work together on a package of those kinds of measures,"" Nuland added. Putin has warned the West and Kiev against crossing the Kremlin's ""red lines"" over staging military exercises and building up weaponry in Ukraine. Blinken insisted in Riga that NATO allies were ""making sure that Ukraine has the means to defend itself."" And he said that the alliance would ""look at what it needs to do in the event of further Russian aggression, to shore up its own defenses"" as NATO eyes bolstering forces along its eastern flank. Blinken said Russia was using the same ""playbook"" it employed when it took control of Crimea, including by intensifying ""disinformation"" to portray Kiev as the ""aggressor"". The foreign minister of Ukraine – which has seen its bid for membership in NATO stall – urged the U.S.-led alliance for a ""deterrence package"" to stop Russia as he attended the meeting in Riga. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell also pledged the bloc ""will be standing firmly and decisively with Ukraine in front of any attempt to undermine its territorial integrity and sovereignty.""

Speaking in his annual address to the Ukrainian parliament on Wednesday, Zelenskiy said the return of Crimea to Ukraine following Moscow’s 2014 annexation of the peninsula should be the country’s main goal — but stopped short of saying it should be retaken by force. “We see this as a direct threat to Russia,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying by Interfax. “Such wording means that the regime in Kiev intends to use all available possibilities, including force, in order to encroach on a Russian region."" In addition to the conflict over the annexation of Crimea, Kiev has been locked in a nearly eight-year war with pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine that has claimed over 13,000 lives. Ukraine and its Western allies accuse Russia of sending arms and funding to the rebels, claims Mosow denies. Tensions have ratcheted up significantly between Ukraine and Russia in recent weeks, with Kiev accusing Moscow of massing forces near their shared border and the United States warning of a possible Russian invasion. Russia, in turn, has accused Ukraine of massing troops near southeastern Ukraine, and NATO of provocations. Zelenskiy on Wednesday called for direct talks with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to end the escalation. “Let’s be honest, the war in Donbass has been going on for eight years. Eight years since Russia annexed Crimea,” Zelenskiy said. “We must talk, knowing that we have a strong and powerful army.” Kiev's Western allies have warned that Russia could use a perceived threat to its security as pretext for an invasion of Ukraine. ""The likelihood of hostilities in Ukraine is still high,"" Peskov said Thursday. ""This remains a matter of particular concern and worry for us. We are seeing an increase in the intensity of provocative actions on the contact line."" Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) said Thursday it had detained three alleged Ukrainian spies who it said were gathering secrets and plotting terrorist attacks. The chief diplomats of the U.S. and Russia are due to meet in Sweden on Thursday, where they are likely to discuss the escalation in tensions with Ukraine.

""According to some reports, the number of Ukrainian troops in the conflict zone has already reached 125,000 personnel,"" she claimed, saying this represented half of Kiev's troops. Those comments followed the Ukrainian foreign ministry saying Tuesday that Russia has massed 115,000 troops around Ukraine, on the Crimean peninsula and in two eastern regions occupied by the breakaway fighters. Putin on Tuesday declined to say whether Moscow planned to move troops across Ukraine's border. ""Look, they spoke about a possible Russian military intervention in Ukraine at the beginning of the year. But as you see this did not happen,"" Putin said.

""According to some reports, the number of Ukrainian troops in the conflict zone has already reached 125,000 personnel,"" she claimed, saying this represented half of Kiev's troops. Those comments followed the Ukrainian foreign ministry saying Tuesday that Russia has massed 115,000 troops around Ukraine, on the Crimean peninsula and in two eastern regions occupied by the breakaway fighters. Putin on Tuesday declined to say whether Moscow planned to move troops across Ukraine's border. ""Look, they spoke about a possible Russian military intervention in Ukraine at the beginning of the year. But as you see this did not happen,"" Putin said. The Russian leader added that the security interests of all parties should be taken into account and called for improved ties. Blinken was in Latvia on Wednesday where a meeting of NATO foreign ministers focused largely on tensions over Russia's military build-up. During the gathering, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called for a ""deterrence package"" to stop Russia. Blinken is scheduled to hold talks with Lavrov on the sidelines of a meeting of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) after meeting Kuleba. The Kremlin has blamed the escalation in tensions on the West supplying Ukraine with modern weaponry, conducting drills in the Black Sea and flying bombers near Russia's borders.",1,631,97.62,65.29,49.61,5.71,21.76,31.7,79.24,56.74,42.16,4.6,1.9,0,0.95,0.16,0.32,0.32,2.69,12.04,8.4,1.43,18.23,5.55,1.9,4.28,0.63,13.79,5.55,2.85,8.72,3.49,0.48,4.75,5.71,0.16,5.39,1.27,0.16,0.63,0.63,0,2.38,0,5.71,1.9,3.65,0.32,0,0.16,0.16,0,0,0,14.1,8.4,0.79,0,1.27,0.63,4.6,6.18,0,0,0.32,0.32,5.86,3.8,2.06,0,2.85,0.32,0,2.54,0.16,0,0.32,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.16,0.32,0,0.48,0,0,0,0,0.63,0.16,3.49,13.31,0.63,1.43,9.98,0.79,0,0.95,3.96,5.07,3.33,0.48,0,0,0,0,0,16.48,4.91,4.44,0,0,2.38,4.75

Western powers have been sounding the alarm in recent weeks about Russia massing troops along the border with Ukraine, further stoking tensions in an area where a long-running conflict has already left 13,000 dead. Moscow, which is accused of backing the separatists fighting Kiev, has denied preparing an attack and accuses NATO of raising the temperature.

Striking a conciliatory note, Blinken said the U.S. was ready to ""facilitate"" the ""full implementation"" of the Minsk peace accords. The Minsk deal was reached after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and aimed at resolving the conflict with pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine but never enforced. ""The best way to avert a crisis is through diplomacy,"" Blinken said. The U.S., Russia and Ukraine were all in Stockholm on Thursday for a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), one of the few international dialogue forums to which both the U.S. and Russia belong. Speaking in the plenary session, Blinken called on Moscow to ""de-escalate, reverse the recent troop build-up (and) return forces to normal peaceful positions."" Lavrov meanwhile warned that the ""nightmare scenario of a military confrontation was returning"" in Europe, accusing NATO of inching its military infrastructure closer to Russia's borders. He reiterated his opposition to any NATO expansion eastward — including Ukraine — but said Russia was open to dialogue. ""We are interested in joint efforts toward a resolution of the Ukraine crisis,"" he said. Despite the cordial tone, the OSCE meeting took place amid spiking tensions. At a NATO meeting in the Latvian capital Riga on Wednesday, Blinken accused Russia of trying to ""destabilize Ukraine from within as well as large scale military operations"". He said it was not known whether Russian President Vladimir Putin had decided to invade, but added: ""We do know that he's putting in place the capacity to do so on short order, should he so decide."" Blinken warned there would be ""far-reaching and long-lasting consequences"" for Moscow if it pushed ahead with any aggression, including ""a range of high-impact economic measures that we've refrained from using in the past."" Blinken also held talks on Thursday with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, who said his country would ""demonstrate restraint."" But he called on Kiev's partners to ""prepare a deterrence package"" that would make Russia think twice before resorting to military force. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had said on Wednesday that Crimea was Ukrainian territory and Kiev's goal was to ""liberate"" it. ""We see this as a direct threat to Russia,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday. Outside the diplomatic forum, tensions continued on the ground on Thursday. A Ukrainian soldier was killed in clashes with pro-Russian separatists, Kiev said, while Moscow announced it had arrested three Ukrainian spies, including one it said had been planning a terrorist attack. The OSCE meeting was planned long in advance but comes at a crucial moment as tensions mount on numerous issues in Europe. In addition to Ukraine, other issues on the meeting's agenda include the migrant crisis on the Belarus-EU border and the resurgence of clashes between OSCE members Armenia and Azerbaijan.

According to the Levada Center, 39% of Russian respondents believe that war with Ukraine is either highly likely or unavoidable. Another 38% said that Russian-Ukrainian war is unlikely. Only 15% rule out the possibility of a Russian-Ukrainian war. Exactly half of those polled blamed the U.S. and other NATO countries for the current tensions in Ukraine. Older respondents were more likely to blame the West than their younger counterparts. The U.S. and its allies have in recent weeks said their intelligence and Russian troop movements near Ukrainian borders pointed to Moscow’s plans to invade Ukraine. Russia has denied planning an invasion, saying its military maneuvers come in response to Ukraine’s troop buildup. Moscow has also recently stepped up accusations of NATO’s eastward expansion and its deployment of weapons that threaten Moscow’s security. According to Levada, 16% of Russian respondents pinned the blame for heightened tensions on Ukraine. That figure saw little change when broken down into age groups. Only 4% blamed Russia and 3% the pro-Moscow breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine for the standoff. These figures also remained unchanged across all age groups. Younger Russians, however, were more likely to say that no one is to blame for the Russian-Ukrainian tensions or not answer the question than their older counterparts.

To encourage Biden to accept this responsibility, Russia has been staging military drills close to Ukraine’s borders, with enough troops massing there to launch an offensive. As Putin seeks a final formula for the configuration of the post-Soviet space, the signal is clear: if the Minsk agreements aren’t being implemented, the alternative is military force. Back in October, Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said that in order to help resolve the conflict, the United States doesn’t necessarily have to be part of the Normandy format for talks (that format consists of Ukraine, Russia, France, and Germany). Another way of interpreting this is that Moscow doesn’t see the need for the Europeans to take part in any serious conversation on Ukraine, since it believes that any such conversation should take place directly between Moscow and Washington. This was also the thinking behind the Russian Foreign Ministry’s controversial publication of confidential correspondence on Ukraine between the ministry’s head, Sergey Lavrov, and his French and German colleagues: Moscow is showing that there is nothing to discuss with Ukraine’s advocates, and that talks should be held directly with its patron Washington. It also explains Lavrov’s complaints that Russia proposed including the United States in the Normandy format, but that Germany and France refused, as well as Putin’s calls for firm guarantees that NATO will not expand further east: something only the United States can promise. Although this may look like an unreasonable negotiating position now, it clearly sets out the strategic horizon of Russia’s demands. If those demands are satisfied, Russia is ready to promise predictability and security. In other words, the issue here is the Minsk agreements in their broadest interpretation: a chain of actions and obligations that should lead to a Ukraine that is friendly and neutral, but not necessarily subordinate to Moscow: something along the lines of Kazakhstan. By massing its troops at Ukraine’s borders, Russia is implying that Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements is a sign it wants to take back the Donbas by force. Ukraine’s Western allies don’t believe for one minute that Kiev would embark on such a reckless undertaking, and instead see it as a sign of impending Russian aggression. The Americans don’t want a war in Europe: it could lead to the defeat of their ally Ukraine, and the need to come back swinging at Russia. The impossibility of responding by force and the insufficiency of further sanctions would make America look weak for the second time in a year, following its withdrawal from Afghanistan. In these circumstances, it’s better to work on the Minsk accords — or other agreements. Judging by the Russian communique on the presidential meeting, as well as by the press conference given by Biden’s national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, the United States is indeed prepared to push for the implementation of the Minsk agreements. Still, Biden can’t just accept responsibility for implementing the agreements simply because the Kremlin is disappointed in Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the Europeans: that would mean he was carrying out Putin’s wishes, and he has promised not to give in to him. In this respect, the buildup of troops and talk of an imminent Russian attack on Ukraine are very timely. For having confirmed to Putin the U.S. commitment to taking part in resolving the Ukraine conflict, Biden needs something in exchange — like showing the world he has managed to stop Putin and prevent a war. That’s no mean feat, and a powerful defense against those who have criticized him for even sitting down with Putin. For this reason, among others, the idea of an impending war began to take on a life of its own even before the summit, and to have as much impact on the behavior of the parties involved as actual events. The source of this talk of a coming war is Western media, politicians, and experts: not the Kremlin, which prefers to use secret special operations to achieve its goals, rather than openly mobilize its troops, which is simply a way of strengthening its negotiating position. Biden has come out of this as the leader who prevented a war, but that’s not to say that the summit will necessarily be followed by deescalation and the return of Russian troops to their barracks, as was the case back in the spring after the agreement to hold the Geneva summit. This time, no dramatic deescalation is likely. Biden will be the leader who prevented a war, but not the threat of war: not until Moscow sees new steps taken by Washington on Ukraine and visible signs of work on engaging with Russian security concerns. The Minsk agreements themselves are not equally acceptable to Ukraine and the United States. Washington has said that the agreements are the most important and, effectively, the only way of resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The United States cannot, without losing face, give public assurances that Ukraine will not join NATO. Its intentions on this issue can only be divined from indirect signs over several months, or even years. For Moscow, progress on implementing the parts of the Minsk agreements that are most unpalatable to Kiev would show that its concerns are being taken seriously, rather than being ignored in the hope they will blow over. The problem is that Kiev is prepared to wait until any fresh insistence on the Minsk agreements being implemented blows over. Just as the West overestimates the absolute influence of Putin, Moscow is mistaken when it sees Ukraine as a mere U.S. satellite. The West may have some levers of influence over Kiev, but nothing can replace the conflict in the Donbas as a source of anti-Russian mobilization within Ukraine, and a way of attracting allies and constantly putting pressure on Moscow in international affairs. Russia would be satisfied with a neutral, friendly, bilingual Ukraine, but that would be seen as a humiliating step backwards by many in Ukraine. For this reason, the danger of renewed hostilities in eastern Ukraine is considerably less virtual than the presidential summit. Handing over responsibility for the Minsk agreements to the United States is Putin’s final attempt to resolve the issue of Ukraine before 2024 — when his current term ends — within the existing legal framework. If that doesn’t work, Putin, who is consolidating his political and historical legacy ahead of 2024, will look for other ways of resolving the Ukraine crisis. It appears that what he manages to achieve in Ukraine will be the deciding factor in whether or not Putin stays on after 2024. From his words and an article on the issue, it’s clear that Putin sees relations with Ukraine as part of his historical mission. That’s not something he wants to leave in less experienced hands, nor to share the credit for in the event of success. And in the event of failure? Well, if victory hasn’t yet been achieved, perhaps it’s not the time to step down.

Putin's comments came as U.S. President Joe Biden was scheduled to speak with Ukraine leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the heads of other countries on Russia's borders concerned over Kremlin military aggression. They came in response to a question during a meeting of the presidential rights council, during which Putin fielded a query on discrimination against Russian speakers beyond Russia's borders. ""I have to say that Russophobia is a first step towards genocide,"" the Russian leader said. ""You and I know what is happening in Donbass,"" referring to the conflict zone in the east of the country, adding that: ""It certainly looks like genocide."" Putin has previously made similar comparisons about the war in eastern Ukraine including in 2015 and 2019. Most people in Ukraine speak both Ukrainian and Russian, though regions in the south and east — and some in the center — are predominantly Russian-speaking and have traditionally been more Russia friendly. A popular uprising in Ukraine forced a Moscow-backed regime out of office in 2014. Since then Moscow has annexed Crimea and Kiev's forces are locked in conflict with separatists supported by Russia in the east of Ukraine. The fighting there has cost some 13,000 lives so far. The United States and its allies have for weeks accused Russia of planning an invasion of Ukraine and massing troops along Kiev's borders.

All three Ukrainian nationals had confessed to being recruited by Ukraine’s military and security services, Interfax quoted the FSB as saying. Ukraine's security service, the SBU, denied the incident, saying the accusation was ""fake"" and part of a ""hybrid war"" effort. The Russian intelligence service said one of those detained had planned to detonate two explosive devices at an undisclosed location. The FSB identified the alleged spy as Oleksandr Tsilyk, who had reportedly confessed to being recruited by the Ukrainian defense ministry's main intelligence directorate. “I was recruited in May 2021,” he was quoted as saying, adding that Ukrainian intelligence had trained him to “work with dead drops and special communications.” A father-and-son pair identified as Zinoviy and Ihor Koval also confessed to being ordered by the Security Service of Ukraine to “photograph road and railway bridges as well as a thermal plant” in exchange for a $10,000 reward, Interfax reported. The FSB’s anti-terrorist unit said it had uncovered “short-barrelled automatic weapons and personal protective equipment” in the pair’s vehicle that were sent for forensic review. The FSB did not disclose where in Russia or when the alleged spies had been detained. Its announcement of arrests comes amid growing warnings from Ukraine and its Western allies that Russia may be gearing up for an early 2022 invasion of Ukraine with a fresh troop buildup. Moscow has in return blamed Kiev for massing tens of thousands of troops near pro-Russia separatist-held territory in southeast Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy this week called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to explicitly deny plans to move Russian troops across the Ukrainian border, which Putin declined to do. Zelenskiy previously disclosed that Ukrainian intelligence services uncovered discussions between Ukrainian and Russian nationals of a Dec. 1-2 coup. The Kremlin denied any involvement.

",English,Russia,"Once again, the world is discussing the possibility of Russia waging war against Ukraine. This time, however, the circumstances are extraordinary. Back in the spring, the buildup of Russian troops for military drills close to Ukraine’s borders ended in a series of communications between the U.S. president and the leaders of Russia and Ukraine, followed by the summit this summer between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Joe Biden. At the time, that flare-up in tensions was explained as being down to the desire to put the Donbass conflict firmly on the agenda of the new U.S. president and to force new talks on the issue. Although the current escalation appears similar to that of the spring, a whole host of new circumstances has been thrown into the mix. The Russian Foreign Ministry has broken a diplomatic taboo by publishing confidential correspondence with Germany and France over Ukraine: something that would have needed to be approved at the very top. Speaking at the Foreign Ministry soon after this, Putin called for “serious, long-term guarantees that ensure Russia’s security in this area [its Western borders], because Russia cannot constantly be thinking about what could happen there tomorrow.” It’s not clear what form such guarantees would take, but it’s likely that ahead of another possible summit between Putin and Biden, Moscow would like to receive assurances similar to those made to Beijing: not to enter into an open conflict with China, and not to try to change the Chinese political system. Instead of such assurances, however, Russia has seen Western military vessels close to Russia’s borders, and a resolution introduced to the U.S. Congress that would automatically declare Putin’s rule illegitimate beyond the next elections in 2024. It seems that Russia does not have the same sway as China to obtain the promises that one superpower has given another. As a recent superpower, Russia considers this particularly unpleasant, and the simmering conflict in eastern Ukraine could be used to give it more clout. The West finds itself, therefore, facing the uncomfortable dilemma of whether to boost Russia’s status, thereby rewarding the dangerous exploitation of a simmering conflict, or to refuse to give Moscow the promises it desires, thus conserving the conflict in its heated state. Russia’s action of releasing the diplomatic correspondence and Putin’s call for guarantees can be interpreted in two ways. Either Moscow has information that Kiev is seriously considering a military solution to the problem of the Donbass separatists, or Russia itself is preparing for a military operation in eastern Ukraine, and these overwrought statements are an attempt to absolve itself of responsibility for its future actions: alas, Moscow had warned of the coming storm, and called for action, but to no avail. The problem is that if implemented, the first scenario of Ukraine taking back Donbass by force would instantly turn into the second: of Russia invading Ukraine. Western journalists and politicians would not have enough time to decide who started it, nor indeed the motivation, since Ukraine would be acting on territory internationally recognized as its own, unlike Russia, which would inevitably be designated the aggressor. Even if Russia were only responding to action taken by Ukraine, it would still be seen as invading: something the West has warned against. Determining how proportionate a response was to the use of force would be a long and difficult process. In Kiev, the tone of Moscow’s statements is seen as a sign that Russia itself is preparing to strike first, and is simply trying to push responsibility for resumed hostilities elsewhere. Russia vividly recalls Georgia’s attempt to regain control over South Ossetia in 2008, which was thwarted by Russia’s intervention. Despite the fact that Georgia’s proactive role in the events of the six-day war is now much clearer (thanks to Wikileaks and the Tagliavini report), that war is still broadly cited as an example of Russian aggression and occupation, since it unfolded on territory internationally accepted as part of Georgia, albeit at the location of a frozen conflict. Georgia’s then president Mikheil Saakashvili’s attack on South Ossetia is still considered to have been prompted by a deliberate provocation by separatists and Moscow. In a situation in which the two sides suspect each other of harboring the worst intentions, and with every hour counting at the start of military action, the South Ossetia scenario could unfold of its own accord. A confrontation on the Donbass demarcation line that goes beyond the regular clashes could prompt a response like that over Ossetia: why wait for the worst to happen? Nor would it be hard to manufacture such an event, should there be any desire to do so. If the West views any events in Donbass in the broader context of a Russian attack on Ukraine’s territorial integrity, and even the restoration of the Russian empire, many in Moscow see those same events as an attack by the Kiev authorities on the integrity of ethnic Russians. In his recent article on Ukrainian history, Putin wrote in startlingly harsh terms about the disappearance of hundreds of thousands of Russians, comparing it to the use of weapons of mass destruction. A man who holds such views is unlikely to simply step down from his post without even trying to stop such an adverse turn of events. What would his successors say? After all, Ukraine was offered the decent option of the Minsk agreements and voluntary federalization, while the West was offered Ukrainian neutrality. The options left are the bad ones. Russia, for its part, is discovering its own worst option. For three decades, the greatest fear of the Russian leadership was that Ukraine (and Belarus) would join NATO and move Western military infrastructure right up to Russia’s borders. Now it turns out that that can happen even without NATO, and in more real and long-term and less predictable ways. An aggrieved country that is building its entire identity on the rejection of everything Russian is far easier to turn into a fortified area on Russia’s border than a country confined by NATO procedures. In the absence of any security guarantees from a bloc, that country will be ready at the drop of a hat to welcome foreign aircraft, ships, and troops, and to equip its own army, leaping into action out of fear. Russia’s military preparations, the publication of the confidential correspondence, and Putin’s call for guarantees on its southwestern flank signal that Moscow has recognized the danger of coexisting with such a fortified area and does not want to accept it, but doesn’t yet know what to do about it. For now, Moscow and Kiev are opting to increase their own significance by showing how — with their restrained and responsible behaviour — they are saving humanity from the danger of a global conflict into which the opposite side would readily drag the world.

Fears that this time, the Kremlin’s actions will culminate in another war have prompted a hastily arranged video call on Ukraine between U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin, due to take place on Dec. 7. So far, all of the Western anxiety and hand-wringing about the crisis seems to be clouding people’s ability to listen to what the Kremlin is actually saying. Until now, there has been surprisingly little Western acknowledgement that Russian President Vladimir Putin is being much blunter about what he wants in Ukraine and the lengths to which he is prepared to go to obtain it. In just a few days, Putin has said that he wants a deal to prevent Ukraine from ever joining NATO. He also wants a Western promise never to deploy NATO military infrastructure in Ukraine. Putin cited U.S. MK-41 missile launchers now in Romania to illustrate what he’s worried about: “I will repeat once again that the issue concerns the possible deployment in the territory of Ukraine of strike systems with the flight time of 7–10 minutes to Moscow, or 5 minutes in the case of hypersonic systems. Just imagine that.” Why is Putin, who sometimes keeps his cards close to the vest, being so specific? Seen from Moscow, it appears that the Kremlin’s key objective in the current crisis is not to inflict a humiliating defeat on Kiev or to take on the unsavory job of occupying Ukraine. Rather it is aimed at persuading the West that Russia is prepared to start a full-scale war over Ukraine unless something is done about the existing and (in Putin’s eyes, at least) completely unacceptable state of affairs. Over the past year, the Kremlin has communicated two simple messages to Biden and his team. First, Russia attaches paramount importance to Ukraine. Second, its patience with the status quo is running thin, and it is ready to take drastic measures to reverse the situation. These messages come in a variety of forms, including harsh public statements, lengthy essays penned by members of the Russian leadership such as Putin himself, and even the publication of confidential correspondence between Moscow and France and Germany on the Donbas conflict. The last step was unprecedented and apparently intended to communicate Russia’s utmost irritation with the stalemate in the implementation of the Minsk agreements aimed at ending the conflict. Moscow’s main concern — preventing Ukraine from joining NATO — is hardly new news. What has changed is that the Kremlin now argues that even if Ukraine never formally accedes to the alliance, it must never be turned into a U.S. military bridgehead on Russia’s border. Other issues are also being identified as must-haves by the Kremlin. It wants to prevent the European Union from linking flows of Russian natural gas to Europe to the Ukrainian conflict. This issue has become more acute in recent months due to the debate over the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was designed to end once and for all the need for export infrastructure passing through Ukrainian territory. Cultural issues are particularly neuralgic. In his extensive article on Russia-Ukraine relations, Putin emphasized the historical affinity and unity of the two nations while harshly accusing the Ukrainian authorities of using coercive assimilation policies to diminish the number of Russians living in Ukraine “by millions.” The use of such strong wording was no coincidence: mass coercive assimilation may constitute a misdeed grave enough to warrant a foreign intervention to stop it. Ever convinced that a kind word and a gun are more efficient than a kind word alone, Russia has accompanied all of these forms of communication with military ones, transforming the security balance on the ground. By moving huge numbers of troops to the Ukrainian border, the Kremlin now has the ability to threaten the country from the south and north, as well as the east. Putin wants Biden to finally face up to an unpleasant dilemma. The message is simple: Washington needs to brace itself for its partner Ukraine to be soundly defeated militarily in what would be an especially humiliating re-run of recent events in Afghanistan. Or it can back down and reach a compromise with Moscow over Ukraine. The Kremlin seems to be under no illusions that the first option would inflict huge costs on Russia’s economy and international standing. But it wants to convince the United States that it is prepared to bear those costs because of the importance of Ukraine for Russian national interests. Putin is also seeking to persuade Washington that unlike Russia, it has little to lose from compromising over Ukraine. The country’s fate is hardly a U.S. vital interest worth going to war over, let alone an important element of the Biden administration’s foreign policy agenda. If Washington doesn’t need Ukraine as an ally in its standoff with China or to fight climate change, why sleepwalk into a possible confrontation with Russia over it? Just a few months ago, Biden showed that he believed U.S. interests in Afghanistan were not sufficient to justify an open-ended troop presence and that he was willing to scale back U.S. commitments in order to adapt his foreign policy to new global realities. In the Kremlin’s view, it is now time for the United States to make a similar rational choice about Ukraine.

Vows to Prevent Any Russian Invasion of Ukraine,English,Russia,"U.S. President Joe Biden said Friday he would make it ""very, very difficult"" for Russia to launch any invasion of Ukraine, which warned that a large-scale attack may be planned for next month. Washington and Kiev say Moscow has massed troops near Ukraine's borders and accuse Russia of planning an invasion. Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin are due to hold a video call in the near future to discuss the rising tensions, both sides confirmed Friday. Biden told reporters in Washington he was putting together ""the most comprehensive and meaningful set of initiatives to make it very, very difficult for Mr Putin to go ahead and do what people are worried he may do."" Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and has since been accused of backing separatists fighting Kiev in the east of the country. The conflict has left more than 13,000 dead. ""The most likely time to reach readiness for escalation will be the end of January,"" Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov told parliament in Kiev on Friday. A report in the Washington Post on Friday citing U.S. officials and an intelligence document said Russia was planning a multi-front offensive involving up to 175,000 troops as soon as next year. Reznikov said a ""winter training period"" had started in Russia and that Moscow had already launched exercises near Ukrainian territory. He estimated that Russia had around 100,000 troops near Ukraine's border. Russia denies any military build-up. On the frontline in eastern Ukraine, government troops said they were ready to repel any Russian assault. ""Our task is simple: not to let the enemy enter our country,"" a soldier named Andriy, 29, told AFP, smoking in a trench near the frontline town of Svitlodarsk. ""All our guys are ready to hold them back. This is our land, we will protect it until the end,"" another soldier, Yevgen, 24, added. Kremlin foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov told reporters a date had been agreed for the Putin-Biden video summit but would not be announced until final details of the talks have also been set. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the call was expected ""in the very near future."" Asked if he had spoken to Putin on Friday morning, Biden shouted ""no"" as he left a press conference in Washington. He gave no further details of his planned ""initiatives"" on Ukraine. Putin has warned the West and Kiev against crossing the Kremlin's ""red lines"" over staging military exercises and building up weaponry in Ukraine. When reporters asked Biden whether he would accept Putin's line, he responded, ""I won't accept anybody's red line."" Despite increased contacts between the two rivals since Putin and Biden met for the first time at a summit in Geneva in June, tensions remain high. As well as the Ukraine conflict, Russia and the United States continue to argue over cyberattacks and the staffing of their embassies, after several waves of diplomatic expulsions. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told AFP on Friday that it rejects any efforts to get it to scrap its plans to join NATO. Moscow wants to see an end to NATO's eastward expansion, after much of Eastern Europe joined the alliance following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Agreeing to abandon its plans to join the alliance ""is not an option,"" Kuleba said on the sidelines of an OSCE meeting in Stockholm. ""I reject this idea that we have to guarantee anything to Russia. I insist that it's Russia who has to guarantee that it will not continue its aggression against any country,"" he said.

He did not accuse Russia of involvement, though he did say it involved Russian citizens. “Absolutely,” Reuters quoted Prime Minister Denys Shmygal as saying when asked if the Russian state was behind the alleged coup plot. “We have secret data which demonstrates the special intentions [to foment a coup],” Shmygal said on a visit to Brussels for talks with top EU officials. The Ukrainian prime minister added that intelligence had picked up activities of “outside powers” trying to influence Ukraine’s political opposition to whip up popular discontent and a government overthrow. “We understand there was influence from outside to enforce protests in Kiev, to make them stronger. Our secret service is making a special investigation,” Shmygal said. The Kremlin denied any involvement Friday. “We don’t engage in that,” Interfax quoted Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov as telling reporters.

The short-notice call came amid high alarm from Washington over Russia’s massing of troops near the Ukrainian border, with reports saying U.S. intelligence has information on a possible Russian invasion as soon as late January. But although the Kremlin described the two-hour discussion as “frank and businesslike,” the path forward for both sides — and Ukraine — remains unclear. Here’s a recap of what the two leaders discussed: Western response if Russia invades Ukraine “President Biden voiced the deep concerns of the United States and our European allies about Russia's escalation of forces surrounding Ukraine,” the White House said in a statement. Biden “made clear that the U.S. and our allies would respond with strong economic and other measures in the event of military escalation.” The U.S. leader also “called for de-escalation and a return to diplomacy,” the statement said. Biden's national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, said there were sanctions that Washington had held back from in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine, but was ""prepared to do now."" According to Bloomberg, these would include fresh restrictions on the Russian ruble, Russian sovereign debt, and on some of the country’s largest financial institutions. Cutting off Russia from the SWIFT international payment system is also on the table if there is an invasion. Nord Stream 2 Following the call, U.S. officials made clear that if the Russian leader does take military action against Ukraine, freezing the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline and its money-earning potential would be a key mode of retaliation. The 10 billion-euro ($12 billion) pipeline, majority-owned by Russian giant Gazprom, was completed in September, just around the time the Russian buildup of some 100,000 troops near the border with Ukraine began. “It is leverage for the West, because if Vladimir Putin wants to see gas flow through that pipeline, he may not want to take the risk of invading Ukraine,” said White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. Putin’s ‘red lines’ The Kremlin said Putin blamed NATO for tensions in Ukraine and insisted on “legal guarantees” against the Western military alliance expanding its forces any closer to Russia. Putin says he sees Ukraine's growing alliance with Western nations as a threat to Russian security — and that any move by Ukraine to join NATO or to host NATO missiles would be unacceptable. “Russia is seriously interested in obtaining reliable legal guarantees that will exclude NATO's eastward expansion and the deployment of offensive strike weapons in countries adjacent to Russia,” the Kremlin said. Restoring diplomatic missions Biden and Putin discussed options for restoring both countries’ diplomatic missions, which have been left hamstrung by several rounds of tit-for-tat diplomat expulsions. The U.S. Embassy in Russia has been forced to suspend nearly all services. “The Russian side proposed to annul all the accumulated restrictions on the functioning of diplomatic missions, which could also serve to normalize other aspects of bilateral relations,” the Kremlin said. What else was discussed? Putin and Biden also discussed bilateral strategic stability plans set in place at their June summit in Geneva, efforts to fight ransomware and cybercrime and joint work on regional issues such as Iran. What wasn’t discussed? The pair did not discuss the poisoning and jailing of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, the banning of his groups as “extremist” or the controversial results of this year’s parliamentary elections. While Washington has criticized Russia over these issues, Moscow views such criticisms as interference in its domestic affairs. Washington’s accusations of Russian meddling in its presidential elections were also absent from the conversation. What are the results? Apart from agreeing to keep dialogue open in the interests of maintaining international security, Biden and Putin appear to have failed to make any significant breakthroughs. The White House did not say how Biden responded to Putin’s request for guarantees to halt NATO’s expansion or block Ukraine’s path to membership. Sullivan told reporters that Biden ""made no such commitments or concessions."" Biden is expected to speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Thursday. Asked if Russia planned to draw down troops after the summit, the Kremlin's top foreign policy adviser Yury Ushakov said: ""Russian troops are on their territory, they are threatening no one, the president has said so."" Ushakov insisted that a possible invasion of Ukraine by Russia had not been discussed.

Troops to Ukraine  Not on the Cards  ",English,Russia,"President Joe Biden said Wednesday he had warned his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin of unprecedented US sanctions if Russia attacks Ukraine. A day after talking for two hours by video link, Biden said he had told Putin the United States would retaliate with sanctions ""like none he's ever seen"" in the event of a Russian assault on Ukraine. ""I made it very clear, if in fact he invades Ukraine, there will be severe consequences, severe consequences -- economic consequences like none he's ever seen or ever have been seen,"" Biden told reporters at the White House. Biden said that in addition to economic measures, a new Russian attack on Ukraine would trigger a bolstered US military presence on the territory of NATO allies in eastern Europe. ""We would probably be required to reinforce our presence in NATO countries to reassure particularly those in the eastern flank. In addition to that, I made it clear that we would provide a defensive capability to the Ukrainians as well,"" he said. However, Biden said that sending US troops to defend Ukraine from Russia is ""not on the cards,"" because the country is not part of NATO. ""The idea the United States is going to unilaterally use force to confront Russia invading Ukraine is not on the cards right now,"" Biden said. ""We have a moral obligation and a legal obligation to our NATO allies under Article Five. It's a sacred obligation. That obligation does not extend to... Ukraine.""

The foreign ministry also demanded that NATO stop conducting military exercises close to Russia's borders and added that this and other security proposals would be unveiled ""in the near future."" Earlier this week Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. leader Joe Biden held two hours of talks, with the Kremlin chief demanding that the West put in writing guarantees that Ukraine would not become a NATO launchpad. In the past few weeks Russia moved around 100,000 troops to Ukraine's border. Putin did not say whether Moscow planned to go on the attack but insisted the country has a right to defend its security. On Friday, the Russian foreign ministry said the United States should formally close the door both to Ukraine and Georgia, which were promised in 2008 they would become members one day. ""In the fundamental interests of European security, it is necessary to officially disavow the decision of the 2008 NATO Bucharest summit that 'Ukraine and Georgia will become NATO members,'"" the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement. By supporting Ukraine and Georgia's aspirations, NATO is violating the basic principle of all OSCE participating states to ""not strengthen their security at the expense of the security"" of other states, Moscow said. The military bloc should also guarantee that weapons threatening Russia's security will not be deployed on the country's western borders — by either NATO members or other countries, the ministry said. Moscow also said it wanted to receive a ""concrete"" reaction from NATO regarding a number of earlier proposals, including a demand to move military exercises away from the ""contact line"" between NATO and Russian forces. It added that ""regular dialogue"" between defence officials of Russia, the United States and NATO should resume. Ukraine is nowhere near entering NATO, but the United States helps train Ukrainian forces and has committed more than $2.5 billion to bolster a military that crumpled in the face of the Russian assault back in 2014.",1,358,93.96,25.06,32.66,27.64,29.83,31.84,83.52,56.42,43.58,5.59,0.56,0,0,0,0,0.56,5.03,16.76,9.78,2.51,13.41,5.31,1.68,5.31,1.4,11.73,7.26,4.19,7.82,1.4,0.84,5.59,10.89,0.56,10.06,0.84,0.84,2.51,0.28,1.12,3.91,0,2.23,1.4,0.84,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.94,6.15,0.28,0.28,0.84,0,3.35,2.51,0,0,0,0,8.66,6.7,1.96,0,0.56,0,0,0.28,0.28,0,0.28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.28,0.56,0.28,0,0,0,0,1.96,0.56,2.51,10.61,0.56,1.68,8.66,0,0,0,3.07,5.03,1.96,1.68,0,0,0,0,0,14.53,4.19,3.63,0,0,2.51,4.19

The behind-closed-doors talks came after weeks of rising tensions between Moscow and Washington, as a buildup of Russian troops on its border with Ukraine has sparked fears of a return to all-out hostilities between the two sides. But although the Kremlin described the two-hour discussion as ""frank and businesslike,"" the two leaders appear to have failed to reach a major compromise. Biden ""voiced the deep concerns"" of the U.S. and its European allies toward ""Russia’s escalation of forces surrounding Ukraine"" and vowed ""strong economic and other measures"" in response to a Russian offensive, the White House said in its readout of the call. ""President Biden reiterated his support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and called for de-escalation and a return to diplomacy,"" the White House added. In response, Putin accused NATO of ""making dangerous attempts to conquer Ukrainian territory"" and ""building up its military potential at our borders"" and reiterated his desire for legal guarantees that NATO will not expand any further eastward. The Kremlin said Putin described the current situation as a result of ""Ukraine's internal crisis"" and ""lack of progress"" in implementing the 2015 Minsk peace agreement. Putin also pointed to Ukraine's so-called ""destructive stance"" and its ""provocative actions"" against the eastern Donbass region, the Kremlin readout added. Apart from Ukraine, both the Kremlin and the White House said the two leaders discussed bilateral strategic stability plans set in place at their June summit in Geneva, efforts to fight ransomware and cybercrime and joint work on regional issues such as Iran. The Kremlin added that the two leaders discussed the problem of their countries' ""curtailed"" diplomatic missions following several rounds of tit-for-tat expulsions. ""The Russian side proposed to annul all the accumulated restrictions on the functioning of diplomatic missions, which could also serve to normalize other aspects of bilateral relations,"" the Kremlin said. Biden and Putin agreed that their representatives will maintain a dialogue on these issues, both sides' readouts said. The White House said Biden called the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Italy after the summit to follow up on coordinations between the leaders that took place Monday ahead of the Putin talks. He will also speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Thursday, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said. Байден выразил сожаление, что не смог увидеться лично с Путиным и заявил, что надеется на это в будущем. А в начале встречи - раскатисто рассмеялся. pic.twitter.com/Y7cRnfvguJ U.S. intelligence reportedly indicated that around 175,000 Russian soldiers have massed on the Ukrainian frontier, with a possible offensive as soon as late January. Russia has denied the accusations of military posturing as ""hysteria"" and maintains it is responding to a Ukrainian buildup and NATO provocations. ""Russia has never planned to attack anyone,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said ahead of Tuesday's talks. ""But we have our own red lines."" Mosow has made clear its desire for the U.S. to guarantee that Ukraine will not join NATO, and that deepening Kiev’s informal cooperation with the Western military alliance will be halted. Washington meanwhile has said that no country can block Ukraine's path to NATO membership. Kiev has been locked in a bitter war with pro-Russian separatists in its eastern Donbass region since 2014, the same year Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine. The conflict has claimed over 13,000 lives. Biden was expected to threaten sanctions that would go far beyond those introduced in response to the annexation of Crimea, as well as boosted military support in Eastern Europe, in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine. According to Bloomberg, the sanctions would include fresh restrictions on the Russian ruble, Russian sovereign debt, and on some of the country’s largest financial institutions. The New York Times has reported that cutting off Russia from the SWIFT international payment system is also under discussion if there is an invasion.

The key question hanging over the talks — and the subject of keen debate among analysts and political leaders — is whether Putin might actually launch a cross-border offensive, or whether he is using the troops to pressure Biden for guarantees ex-Soviet Ukraine will never become a NATO launchpad. The two have a daunting list of other differences to air, from Russia's harsh treatment of dissidents to the presence of ransomware hackers on Russian soil to Moscow's support for the repressive regime in Syria. But the magnitude of the Russian buildup near Ukraine — the Kremlin may be planning an offensive early in 2022 involving up to 175,000 troops, according to U.S. intelligence obtained by The Washington Post and other outlets — has raised red flags in Washington and across Europe. Many analysts doubt that Putin would carry through with an invasion — which would inevitably prompt international condemnation and probably new sanctions — but at least some take a darker view. ""Putin has sharply raised the stakes. He is no longer bluffing,"" said Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of the political consultancy R.Politik Center and a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Moscow Center. ""He's ready to take a desperate step,"" she told AFP on Sunday. The looming crisis could pose the sternest test yet of the foreign policy savvy and clout of the 78-year-old U.S. president. Biden and Putin — who are expected to speak around midday Tuesday, Washington time — have a history together. They first met in person in the Kremlin in 2011. Then-vice president Biden later said he told the Russian leader, ""I don't think you have a soul"" (to which, Biden says, Putin responded, ""We understand one another."") They met again in 2014 in Geneva to deal with the now-familiar issue of Russian military pressure on Ukraine. And they met in Geneva on June 16 of this year — for the first time with Biden as president. Contacts have continued since — as have tensions, with Putin seen as eager to pressure Biden into another in-person summit as a way to project parity on the world stage. On Friday, Biden vowed to make it ""very, very difficult"" for Russia to launch an invasion but did not say how. Putin has warned the West and Kiev against crossing the Kremlin's ""red lines,"" including building up weaponry in Ukraine. Biden later responded, ""I won't accept anybody's red line."" Some analysts said Russia, deeply concerned with Ukraine's warming ties to NATO, is applying pressure to cut that movement short. Following Putin's lead, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday called on U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to provide ""security guarantees"" that NATO would not come closer to Russia's border. Stanovaya said this might be Putin's bottom line: ""Either NATO provides guarantees or Russia invades Ukraine,"" she said. Russia has continued to deny any bellicose intentions, instead accusing the West of provocations in the Black Sea. NATO recognized Kiev in June 2020 as one of a handful of so-called ""enhanced opportunity partners,"" potentially a step toward membership. Heather Conley, a former assistant U.S. secretary of state for European affairs, said she believes Putin is willing to apply ""enormous pressure"" in the Ukraine standoff. He is set on another in-person summit with Biden, said Conley, who is with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. And he wants to loosen Western ties to Ukraine which, she said, some see as ""a sort of NATO aircraft carrier."" Fyodor Lukyanov, a prominent political analyst close to the Kremlin, said he doubts Biden and Putin will agree on anything concrete on Tuesday, but he does not expect hostilities to break out if the talks fail. ""No, this is hysteria whipped up by the West,"" he told AFP on Sunday. ""Wars begin suddenly. If it begins, it will begin differently."" Moscow seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and has since backed the separatist forces fighting Kiev. The conflict has left more than 13,000 dead. What if the virtual meeting between the rival leaders goes poorly on Tuesday? If Russia fails to obtain the accommodations it seeks, and all efforts at diplomacy fail, said Conley, her sense is that ""Mr. Putin would then use military means to achieve his political objective.""",1,735,93.73,42.46,39.11,9.69,21.62,27.21,80.82,60.27,45.03,6.12,3.4,0.27,0.14,0.14,2.04,0.54,2.72,12.24,8.03,2.04,16.33,5.58,2.31,5.58,1.09,13.74,7.35,2.99,5.99,0.82,1.36,4.08,11.56,0.54,10.88,1.5,1.5,0.95,2.72,0.68,4.22,0,4.49,1.63,2.72,1.09,0,0.95,0.14,0.54,0,0,11.97,6.39,0.27,0.14,1.22,0.41,3.54,5.71,0,0,0.68,1.5,5.71,4.63,0.95,0.14,3.4,0,0,3.27,0,0.14,0.14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.14,0.68,0.14,0.82,0,0,0,0.27,0.68,0,2.59,11.02,0.27,1.9,7.48,1.09,0,0.41,4.22,4.08,3.95,2.45,0.27,0.14,0.14,0,0,18.5,5.85,5.31,0.14,0,1.5,5.71

U.S. intelligence and NATO allies believe Russia will be ready to conduct an invasion with 175,000 troops by the beginning of 2022. The magnitude of the Russian mobilization on the border makes it hard for the Kremlin this time round to walk back empty-handed. The virtual meeting between U.S. President Biden and Russian President Putin did not suggest a breakthrough in negotiations. The debates in and among the NATO and EU countries about how to respond to Russia’s saber-rattling have devolved into two antagonistic camps, which seems symptomatic of the Western polarization on most foreign-policy issues nowadays. Public debate is healthy when it balances a variety of concerns, but emotional polarization may fail to unite the Western countries around a calibrated policy. The first camp favors accommodating Moscow’s long-standing security concerns if that is what it takes to prevent war. The most debated proposal advocates Kiev to implement the Minsk Agreement concluded in 2015 to solve the conflict in the Donbass, even though this risks giving Russia a de facto veto over Ukraine’s foreign-policy decisions. Others argue that NATO and the United States should find a modus vivendi with Russia, starting with a willingness to bring into play NATO’s Open-Door policy, which today seems pointless to cling to since Ukraine anyway is unlikely to join the alliance. Their implicit assumption is that Russia acts defensively to prevent the the encroachment of rival alliance on its border. The second camp is vehemently opposed to giving in to Russian demands, some even accusing the former of appeasement or of taking a pro-Putin line. They claim pressuring Kiev to unilaterally implement the Minsk Agreement is both immoral and strategically ill-advised since it will invite more Russian aggression. Their explicit assumption is that Russia has broader expansionist ambitions that only superior force can tame – in the present crisis by threatening exclusion from the SWIFT banking system, sanctioning its debt markets, and ending Nord Stream II. While advocating increased military support of Ukraine, no serious policymaker has proposed combat-ready deployments to deter Russian aggression in Ukraine akin to what NATO membership would require. Either way, the premise of Western policy remains unwillingness to intervene militarily on behalf of Ukraine. It now falls on its diplomacy to test the nature of the Russian threat. Putin earlier this year published an essay essentially making the case that Russia and Ukraine make up one people, which was a pre-warning about the Kremlin’s dissatisfaction with status quo in Ukraine. Contrary to the claims of recent commentary, President Putin in the current escalation has been quite specific about his demands: a deal that prevents Ukraine from joining NATO, accompanied by a Western pledge not to deploy military infrastructure in the country. This is consistent with the findings of a recent Carnegie report asserting that Kremlin is as worried about ‘Ukraine in NATO’ as it is about ‘NATO in Ukraine’. In no circumstance could the Western countries agree to conceding Ukraine to a Russian sphere of influence. Pressuring Kiev to implement the Minsk Agreement may not be the best starting point, since that risks giving Russia a veto not only over Ukraine’s military orientation but also its economic and political affiliation with the EU. Instead, Western diplomacy should confine itself to Putin’s specific demands about NATO. It is a long-standing controversy for the Kremlin that gives reason to explore its significance for Ukraine-Russia and West-Russia stability. Considering the utility of the Open-Door policy is no longer as controversial as it was, say, 13 years ago when NATO agreed that Ukraine and Georgia ‘will become members’. Today, this is all but a distant aspiration for well-known both domestic and geopolitical reasons. Other than the general principle that all sovereign countries in Europe are free to choose their alliance affiliations, it is also unclear which NATO allies really wish to extend collective defense guarantees to Ukraine. The growing tension with Russia and the migrant grey-zone attack from Belarus seem to have changed the mood even in the Baltic States and Poland, whose security so crucially depends on the unambiguity of NATO’s collective defense guarantees. NATO could never agree to a ‘closed door’ policy but, if prompted by U.S. leadership, perhaps to negotiate about language that in exchange would commit Russia not to use military force against Ukraine and to solve the conflict in the Donbass. Such language should signal what is already the reality: that NATO has the intention neither to enlarge, nor to station military infrastructure in Ukraine in the current security environment. Negotiations should be treated strictly as a question of military neutrality, without concessions on NATO’s continued advising, training, and funding of Ukraine’s armed forces. It is necessary to factor in the two understandings of the Russian threat here. Should President Putin change his aggressive westward posture, concession on NATO may prove the right path for a more managed great-power rivalry with Russia (moreover, setting the United States on a firmer course to compete with China). Conversely, should Putin feel emboldened to threaten Ukraine and to further push Western lines, NATO has the option of backtracking its language. Rhetoric that does not hold the West back from more than what it might theoretical do seems to be its cheapest bargaining chip. Meanwhile, the Western debate tends to forget that Ukraine achieved what its Euromaidan Revolution in 2013-14 was essentially about: reaching an Association Agreement with the EU. While Ukraine’s exports to the EU and the rest of the world have grown, Ukraine still has not recovered economically to its pre-2014 level. This testifies to the significant domestic problems Ukraine must overcome to achieve prosperity. The more the West can convince Ukraine to define its destiny as one of fight against economic insecurity rather than of geopolitical choice and NATO membership, the more that process is likely to be surrounded by stability.",1,978,92.41,24.25,33.33,8.7,25.74,32.92,80.16,57.77,46.93,6.34,0.72,0,0,0,0.2,0.41,5.62,15.54,9,1.33,16.16,6.03,4.19,4.91,1.33,10.74,6.24,2.76,7.98,1.84,1.12,5.11,12.68,0.61,11.96,2.86,1.94,1.53,2.04,0.51,3.78,0.1,4.19,1.33,2.56,1.12,0,0.82,0.2,0.51,0,0,7.77,6.03,0.92,0,1.94,0.2,1.53,2.15,0,0,0,0.2,5.42,4.4,0.92,0.1,2.35,0.1,0,1.43,0.92,0,0.31,0.31,0.1,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0.41,0.2,0.2,0,0,0,0,1.43,0.1,2.86,7.87,0,0.61,6.95,0,0,0.31,3.27,1.53,4.19,1.33,0.2,0,0.2,0,0,12.37,4.5,3.48,0,0,1.53,2.86

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the conversation will take place in the evening Russia time and the two leaders will determine the duration, according to Russian news agencies. Biden said Friday he would make it ""very, very difficult"" for Russia to launch any invasion of Ukraine, which warned that a large-scale attack may be planned for next month. Washington and Kiev say Moscow has massed troops near Ukraine's borders and accuse Russia of planning an invasion. Russia has denied any bellicose intentions and accused the West of provocation, particularly with military exercises in the Black Sea, which it sees as part of its sphere of influence. Biden and Putin had been expected since Friday to hold a video call. Biden told reporters in Washington he was putting together ""the most comprehensive and meaningful set of initiatives to make it very, very difficult for Mr Putin to go ahead and do what people are worried he may do"". Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and has since been accused of backing separatists fighting Kiev in the east of the country. The conflict has killed more than 13,000. Moscow, meanwhile, wants to see an end to NATO's eastward expansion, after much of eastern Europe joined the alliance following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday called on his U.S. counterpart Antony Blinken to provide ""security guarantees"" that NATO would not come closer to Russia's borders. Despite increased contacts between the two rivals since Putin and Biden met for the first time at a summit in Geneva in June, tensions remain high.

Deputy Foreign Ministry Sergei Ryabkov’s threat follows Moscow’s complaints over NATO weapons deployment in Eastern Europe and Western warnings of Russia’s imminent invasion of Ukraine. “Our response will be military” if the Western military bloc does not guarantee an end to its eastward expansion, Ryabkov told the state-run RIA Novosti news agency. “There will be confrontation,” he added, warning that Moscow would deploy weapons that were previously banned under the INF Treaty, which expired in 2019. “Currently, [these banned weapons] do not exist; we have a unilateral moratorium. We call on NATO and the United States to join this moratorium,” Ryabkov said, lamenting that “they just don’t respond to our proposals.” “There’s basically no trust in NATO,” the senior diplomat told RIA Novosti. “Therefore, we’re no longer playing this kind of game and don’t believe NATO’s assurances.” Elsewhere in Monday’s interview, Ryabkov derided the United States’ “inexplicable fixation” on the threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine. “This isn’t so and cannot be,” he said. Russian President Vladimir Putin held a videoconference with U.S. President Joe Biden last week, where he did not say whether he planned to go on the attack but insisted that Russia has a right to defend its security. Putin also demanded from Biden that the West guarantee in writing that Ukraine would not be a staging ground for NATO. On Friday, Russia’s Foreign Ministry demanded that the U.S. formally close the door to NATO membership to the ex-Soviet republics of Ukraine and Georgia. The Foreign Ministry also demanded that the Western military bloc guarantee the non-deployment of weapons threatening Russia’s security on its western borders.",1,290,68.11,44.13,31.84,4.28,20.71,34.48,80.69,54.14,44.14,10,3.45,0,1.72,0,1.38,0.34,6.55,14.48,7.59,0.34,11.03,7.24,4.14,4.14,3.45,12.76,4.14,1.03,9.31,2.76,0.34,6.21,9.31,0.69,8.62,1.38,1.03,1.03,1.03,1.38,3.45,0,3.45,0.69,2.76,0.69,0,0.69,0,0.34,0,0,15.17,9.31,0,0,2.41,0,5.86,5.86,0,0,0,1.38,8.62,7.93,0.69,0,2.07,0.69,0,1.38,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.41,0,2.76,10.69,1.03,0.34,9.31,0,0,0,3.45,4.14,3.45,2.07,0,0,0,0,0,24.14,6.21,4.83,0,0,4.83,8.28

The group itself, said by Western capitals to work on behalf of the Kremlin in conflict zones, was targeted with an asset freeze, along with eight individuals and three firms, diplomats said. The sanctions list was drawn up by EU officials and unanimously approved by foreign ministers, who met Monday to discuss various world crises and prepare Thursday's summit of European leaders. ""Wagner is a Russian private military company used to destabilize security in Europe and in its neighborhood, notably in Africa,"" one European diplomat said. Wagner is said to be financed by 60-year-old St. Petersburg businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, reputedly close to President Vladimir Putin, who has already been hit with EU and U.S. sanctions for destabilizing Libya and meddling in U.S. elections. Those sanctioned included: Dmitry Utkin, a 51-year-old former lieutenant colonel in Russian military intelligence — once decorated by Putin — now said to be Wagner's commander and responsible for mercenary operations in Ukraine. Utkin is accused of extrajudicial killings, including allegedly ordering a Syrian deserter to be tortured to death and filmed.

During their summit by secure video link Tuesday, Biden warned Putin of a ""strong"" Western economic response should Moscow attack its neighbor. The talks were seen as a chance to lower tensions on the Russian-Ukrainian border, where Moscow has deployed up to 100,000 troops, sparking fears of a major war. ""Russia has a peaceful foreign policy, but has the right to defend its security,"" Putin said at a news conference with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. He refused to say if Moscow planned to move troops massing on Ukraine's frontier across the border, but said that simply watching NATO move closer to Russia would amount to ""criminal inaction."" ""We cannot but be concerned about the prospect of Ukraine's possible admission to NATO, because this will undoubtedly be followed by the deployment of appropriate military contingents, bases and weapons that threaten us,"" he said. The Russian leader stressed that NATO expanding eastwards is a ""very sensitive"" issue for Russia. ""It is one of the key questions in preserving Russia's security,"" he said, adding that Russia had been ""warning"" NATO against any expansion. Putin told Biden on Tuesday that Moscow seeks legal guarantees from the West that Ukraine would not join NATO. The Russian leader nonetheless hailed the talks with Biden as ""constructive,"" saying the pair agreed to continue dialogue. France on Wednesday said it had sent ""strong messages"" to Russia warning that it would face ""strategic and massive consequences"" if it attacked Ukraine. The French foreign ministry statement came after telephone talks this week between the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, the UK and the U.S. It said that the so-called Quint of the five Western allies had in their talks ""expressed their determination that the sovereignty of Ukraine be respected."" The same day, Russia said sent planes to intercept and ""escort"" three French military plans flying near its borders in the Black Sea, in a rise of tensions. Moscow's defence ministry said its pilots escorted French Mirage-2000 and Rafale planes after stopping them from violating the Russian border. It is the latest sign of tensions in the Black Sea, a sensitive region for Russia which controls the Crimea peninsula after annexing it from Ukraine in 2014. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy — who has said he is ready to negotiate with Putin — said it was ""positive"" that Putin and Biden spoke. ""I think it's positive that the president of the United States spoke with the president of Russia,"" Zelenskiy said. He is due to hold talks with Biden on Thursday. ""I believe that Ukraine's victory lies in the fact that the United States has always supported Ukraine, our sovereignty and independence,"" Zelenskiy said at a press conference with Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic. He said it was ""important"" that Biden had taken a ""personal role in resolving the conflict"" in eastern Ukraine. Ex-Soviet Ukraine has been fighting pro-Russia separatists in its eastern Lugansk and Donetsk regions since 2014, shortly after Moscow seized Crimea. Kiev and its Western allies accuse the Kremlin of supporting the separatists — claims Moscow denies — in a conflict that has claimed over 13,000 lives.",1,545,90.97,56.48,20.49,5.27,24.77,27.89,80.55,58.17,42.57,9.72,3.12,0.37,0.55,0,1.28,0.73,6.61,14.86,8.44,1.65,13.94,5.69,1.28,4.22,0.37,13.94,6.06,1.83,7.52,1.65,0.92,5.14,7.71,0.18,7.52,1.47,1.28,0.92,1.28,0.55,2.57,0,4.95,1.47,3.3,0.55,0,0.37,0.37,0,0,0,15.41,9.91,0.73,0,1.65,0.37,6.42,5.5,0,0,0,1.28,6.42,4.59,1.65,0.18,1.65,0,0.18,1.28,0.18,0,0.55,0.18,0,0.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.18,0,0,0,0,1.65,0,1.1,10.09,0.92,1.1,6.61,0.73,0,0.92,3.67,6.61,4.04,1.1,0,0,0,0,0,18.53,4.77,4.77,0,0,1.28,7.71

The Russian and U.S. foreign ministers came face to face in Sweden to discuss recent allegations raised by Kiev and its Western allies that Russia could invade ex-Soviet Ukraine this winter. Western powers have been sounding the alarm for weeks about Russia massing troops along the border with Ukraine, further stoking tensions in an area where a long-running conflict has already left 13,000 dead. Moscow, which seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and backs separatists fighting Kiev, has strongly denied it is plotting an attack and blames NATO for fueling tensions. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday called for ""long-term security guarantees"" on his country's borders to halt NATO's eastward expansion after meeting U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. As Lavrov warned that the ""nightmare scenario of a military confrontation was returning"" in Europe Blinken said it was ""likely the presidents will speak directly in the near future."" Russia also said that it hopes for ""contact"" between Putin and Biden in the coming days. ""The date has not yet been agreed. There are difficulties in aligning the calendars of the two leaders, but contact is very necessary, our problems are multiplying,"" said Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov. ""There is no movement on bilateral affairs, which are more and more reaching an acute crisis phase. There is no mutual understanding about how to de-escalate the situation in Europe,"" he was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies. ""The situation in Europe is very alarming,"" he added. ""It's clear that this will be one of the main topics of discussion at the presidential level."" Attending a meeting in Stockholm of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Lavrov accused NATO of inching its military infrastructure closer to Russia's borders. Blinken said the U.S. had ""deep concerns about Russia's plans for renewed aggression against Ukraine,"" and warned Moscow of ""serious consequences"" if Russia ""decides to pursue confrontation."" But the top U.S. diplomat also struck a conciliatory note, saying the U.S. was ready to ""facilitate"" the ""full implementation"" of the Minsk peace accords. The Minsk deal was reached after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and aimed at resolving the conflict with pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine but never enforced. ""The best way to avert a crisis is through diplomacy,"" Blinken said. A senior U.S. official said Blinken had proposed a meeting of U.S. and Russian experts to draw up a road map aimed at ensuring that all parties respect the accords. The foreign ministers from Russia, Ukraine and the United States were all present in Stockholm for the gathering of the OSCE, one of the few international dialogue forums to which both Russia and the United States belong. Speaking in the plenary session, Blinken called on Moscow to ""de-escalate"" and pull back the troops the West claims have been massing at the Ukrainian border. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, who also met Blinken, said his country would ""demonstrate restraint."" But he called on Kiev's partners to ""prepare a deterrence package"" that would make Russia think twice before resorting to military force. At a NATO meeting in Riga on Wednesday, Blinken had accused Russia of trying to ""destabilise Ukraine from within as well as large scale military operations."" He said it was not known whether Putin had decided to invade, but added: ""We do know that he's putting in place the capacity to do so on short order, should he so decide.""

The British leader echoed concern from the G7 on Sunday about the build-up of Russian forces on the border, urging a diplomatic solution to the stand-off, his office said. His intervention comes after a two-day meeting of the G7 in which the grouping's top diplomats warned Moscow of ""massive consequences"" if it invades the former Soviet state. Direct contact between London and Moscow has been rare since London expelled dozens of Russian diplomats following a chemical weapon attack in the English city of Salisbury. Britain blamed Russia for the 2018 attempted murder of former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with the Cold War-era nerve agent Novichok. It had already accused the Kremlin of being behind the radiation poisoning death of another former Russian agent, Alexander Litvinenko, in London in 2016. Downing Street said Johnson told Putin of his ""deep concern"" at the Russian troop build-up on the border with Ukraine, which Moscow says is defensive. He ""reiterated the importance of working through diplomatic channels to deescalate tensions and identify durable solutions,"" the government statement said. ""The prime minister emphasized the U.K.'s commitment to Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty, and warned that any destabilizing action would be a strategic mistake that would have significant consequences."" The G7, made up of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, unanimously condemned Russia and warned it of severe repercussions in similar language.

According to Bloomberg, the U.S. would increase its package of economic restrictions against Moscow, including further blocks on Russia’s sovereign debt and trading of the Russian ruble. Sanctions could also be slapped on some of the country’s top financial institutions, including state development bank the Russian Direct Investment Fund, effectively banning western financial institutions from dealing with them, Bloomberg said, citing unnamed U.S. sources. The New York Times reported that cutting off Russia’s access to the SWIFT international financial settlement system in the event of an invasion is also under discussion. The two presidents will speak later on Tuesday in an attempt to defuse a tense situation on the Russia-Ukraine border. Ukraine, the U.S. and its western allies have accused Russia of deploying up to 175,000 troops to the region and say they have evidence Moscow is planning an offensive. Russia has denied military posturing and says it is responding to a Ukrainian troop buildup. The two countries have been locked in conflict since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas broke away from Kiev.

The Russian and U.S. foreign ministers came face to face in Sweden to discuss recent allegations raised by Kiev and its Western allies that Russia could invade ex-Soviet Ukraine this winter. Western powers have been sounding the alarm for weeks about Russia massing troops along the border with Ukraine, further stoking tensions in an area where a long-running conflict has already left 13,000 dead. Moscow, which seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and backs separatists fighting Kiev, has strongly denied it is plotting an attack and blames NATO for fueling tensions. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday called for ""long-term security guarantees"" on his country's borders to halt NATO's eastward expansion after meeting U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. As Lavrov warned that the ""nightmare scenario of a military confrontation was returning"" in Europe Blinken said it was ""likely the presidents will speak directly in the near future."" Russia also said that it hopes for ""contact"" between Putin and Biden in the coming days. ""The date has not yet been agreed. There are difficulties in aligning the calendars of the two leaders, but contact is very necessary, our problems are multiplying,"" said Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov. ""There is no movement on bilateral affairs, which are more and more reaching an acute crisis phase. There is no mutual understanding about how to de-escalate the situation in Europe,"" he was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies. ""The situation in Europe is very alarming,"" he added. ""It's clear that this will be one of the main topics of discussion at the presidential level."" Attending a meeting in Stockholm of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Lavrov accused NATO of inching its military infrastructure closer to Russia's borders. Blinken said the U.S. had ""deep concerns about Russia's plans for renewed aggression against Ukraine,"" and warned Moscow of ""serious consequences"" if Russia ""decides to pursue confrontation."" But the top U.S. diplomat also struck a conciliatory note, saying the U.S. was ready to ""facilitate"" the ""full implementation"" of the Minsk peace accords. The Minsk deal was reached after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and aimed at resolving the conflict with pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine but never enforced. ""The best way to avert a crisis is through diplomacy,"" Blinken said. A senior U.S. official said Blinken had proposed a meeting of U.S. and Russian experts to draw up a road map aimed at ensuring that all parties respect the accords. The foreign ministers from Russia, Ukraine and the United States were all present in Stockholm for the gathering of the OSCE, one of the few international dialogue forums to which both Russia and the United States belong. Speaking in the plenary session, Blinken called on Moscow to ""de-escalate"" and pull back the troops the West claims have been massing at the Ukrainian border. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, who also met Blinken, said his country would ""demonstrate restraint."" But he called on Kiev's partners to ""prepare a deterrence package"" that would make Russia think twice before resorting to military force. At a NATO meeting in Riga on Wednesday, Blinken had accused Russia of trying to ""destabilise Ukraine from within as well as large scale military operations."" He said it was not known whether Putin had decided to invade, but added: ""We do know that he's putting in place the capacity to do so on short order, should he so decide."" Blinken warned there would be ""far-reaching and long-lasting consequences"" for Moscow if it pushed ahead with any aggression, including ""a range of high-impact economic measures that we've refrained from using in the past.""

The US and its allies have for weeks accused Russia of planning an invasion of its neighbour, warning of a massive coordinated sanctions response should Putin launch an attack. Tens of thousands of Russian troops are stationed near the borders of ex-Soviet Ukraine, where the West has accused the Kremlin of backing pro-Moscow separatists since 2014. In a phone call with the Finnish president — whose country has traditionally served as middle ground between Russia and the West — Putin said he wanted security talks to begin without delay. He told President Sauli Niinsto that Moscow wants ""to immediately launch negotiations with the United States and NATO in order to develop international legal guarantees for the security of our country,"" the Kremlin said in a statement. Russia's demands, it said, included stopping NATO from expanding east and the deployment of weapons in neighboring states, including Ukraine. Putin reiterated the same demands in a phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron later on Tuesday. In his call with the Finnish president, Putin also accused the Ukrainian leadership of increasingly using ""heavy weapons and attack drones"" against pro-Russia rebels in its separatist east. The Russian leader denies planning an invasion, blaming the Western security alliance for the rise in tensions and demanding ""legal guarantees"" the alliance won't expand eastwards. U.S. President Joe Biden last week warned Putin of ""sanctions like he's never seen"" should Russian troops massed on the Ukrainian border launch an attack. The EU and the G7 met in recent days to coordinate what they warn would be an unprecedented economic sanctions regime if Russia attacks. Putin's comments come a day after Russia's deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov warned Moscow could act militarily if the talks it demands do not materialize. ""The lack of progress towards a political-diplomatic solution to this problem will lead to the fact that we will respond militarily,"" Ryabkov told the RIA Novosti state news agency. Tensions continued to soar Tuesday, with Russia saying it was monitoring a French warship near its borders in the Black Sea. The Russian army last week said it scrambled three of its jets to escort five French and U.S. military aircraft over the sea. Putin has accused the West of provoking tensions in the Black Sea, decrying U.S.-led military exercises there. The Black Sea is a sensitive region for Russia, which controls the Crimean peninsula after annexing it from Ukraine in 2014. Kiev has been fighting a pro-Russia insurgency in its eastern regions since the annexation. The conflict has claimed more than 13,000 lives. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, meanwhile, accused Kiev's ally Germany of blocking a supply of NATO weapons to the country. ""Germany has recently prevented us from getting anti-drone rifles and anti-sniper systems from NATO, which are exclusively defense tools,"" Zelenskiy said in an interview with Italian newspaper La Repubblica published Tuesday. ""Don't we have the right to have them in the eighth year of the war? Obviously, we do,"" he added. A spokesperson for the German foreign ministry said Monday that it could not comment ""on the confidential decisions at the heart of the (NATO) alliance at this stage."" Zelenskiy's comments come after Ukraine said in November it was seeking more military aid from its Western allies to deter Russia from an attack. The Ukraine leader warned of ""much higher losses"" in the event of an invasion. ""Is Russian society ready to pay with the lives of its sons for the attempt to occupy another part of Ukraine?"" he asked. The West for a long time hesitated to sell arms to Kiev, but Ukraine eventually managed to get some defense systems — including Turkish-made Bayraktar drones. Kiev's use of the drones in October was met with criticism from Russia and some of its Western allies, including France and Germany.",1,660,97.7,63.38,36.45,1.23,22,30.76,81.67,55.45,43.18,6.21,2.27,0,0.76,0,1.06,0.3,3.94,14.55,10.45,1.21,16.36,4.55,1.67,3.79,0.76,10.91,5,3.33,10,2.42,0.76,6.97,7.42,0.15,7.12,0.76,1.52,1.36,0.45,0.61,2.42,0,3.94,0.3,3.64,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.85,9.24,1.52,0,1.97,0.91,4.85,6.36,0.15,0.15,0,1.21,7.73,5.45,1.97,0.3,1.97,0,0.3,1.21,0.45,0,0.61,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.45,0.3,0.15,0,0,0,1.67,0,2.73,12.73,0.91,1.06,9.55,0.61,0,0.91,4.85,4.09,3.03,1.52,0,0,0,0,0,15.3,5.15,3.33,0.3,0,1.52,5

Russia has been accused of preparing to invade Ukraine and is amassing tens of thousands of troops close to the Ukrainian border, according to satellite images and Western intelligence reports. Moscow says it is not planning to attack and is responding to Ukrainian military posturing. Just 12% of Ukrainians said they see Russia as an ally, according to the survey by Ukrainian polling organization Rating Group published Friday. Despite this week’s call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his U.S. counterpart Joe Biden, fears remain high and the rhetoric about a possible confrontation has ramped up. In stark comments issued Thursday, Putin said the ongoing conflict between pro-Russia separatists and forces loyal to Kiev in eastern Ukraine “looks a lot like genocide.” Rating Group conducted its survey between Dec. 6-8 —  as Putin held his high-profile video call with Biden — and had 2,500 respondents from Ukraine, excluding Russia-annexed Crimea as well as the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk republics, which have been under separatist control since 2014. In April, when Russia was similarly accused of mounting a significant troop buildup near the Ukrainian border, 76% of Ukrainians said Russia was “hostile.” Some 14,000 people have died in the seven-year conflict between Ukraine and pro-Russian forces. Despite a ceasefire agreement, violations are rife and dozens of fighters from both sides are killed every year. A majority of Ukrainians want that agreement — named the Minsk accords — to be revised, the survey found. The survey also showed Ukrainians have grown significantly more negative toward Belarus over the past eight months as strongman leader Alexander Lukashenko has aligned himself more closely with Moscow amid international isolation. Almost half — 48% — of the respondents said Belarus was a “hostile state,” up from 22% in the previous survey.",1,312,96.3,47.66,35.18,1,22.29,32.37,75.64,54.49,43.27,2.88,1.28,0,0,0,0.96,0.32,1.6,12.82,7.37,4.49,17.31,6.09,2.56,5.77,0.32,11.22,6.09,5.13,5.77,1.28,0.32,4.17,6.41,0.32,6.09,0.64,1.6,0.32,0.64,0,2.56,0,6.09,1.28,4.81,1.6,0,1.6,0.32,1.28,0,0,11.22,7.37,0.64,0,3.85,0.96,2.88,4.17,0,0.32,0,0.96,3.21,1.28,1.92,0,1.6,0,0,1.6,0,0,0.96,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.96,0,0.32,0.32,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.53,11.86,0,0,10.26,1.28,0,0.32,3.85,6.41,3.85,0.64,0,0,0,0,0,16.03,5.13,4.49,0,0,0.32,6.09

Judges in Berlin sentenced Russian Vadim Krasikov, alias Vadim Sokolov, to life in jail after finding him guilty of gunning down Georgian national Tornike Kavtarashvili, 40, in a Berlin park in broad daylight on Aug. 23, 2019. ""Russian state authorities ordered the accused to liquidate the victim,"" presiding judge Olaf Arnoldi said, agreeing with prosecutors that the murder had been carefully planned. The murder was meant ""as retaliation"" for being a Kremlin opponent, the judge added. Moscow immediately slammed what it called a ""political"" ruling against a backdrop of ""general anti-Russian sentiment."" ""We consider this verdict to be a biased, politically-motivated decision that seriously aggravates already difficult Russian-German relations,"" Russia's ambassador to Germany, Sergei Nechayev, said in a statement. The ruling is the first major stress test for Germany's new government, which has vowed a tougher stance towards Russia, and comes amid growing alarm in the West about Russian troop movements on the border with Ukraine. New Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said she had summoned Moscow's ambassador to inform him that Germany was expelling two Russian diplomats in response to the court's ruling. ""This murder by order of the state as determined by the court today constitutes a serious violation of German law and sovereignty,"" Baerbock told reporters. Shortly after the murder in Berlin's Kleiner Tiergarten Park, Germany under then-chancellor Angela Merkel expelled two Russian diplomats in protest at Moscow's perceived lack of cooperation with the investigation. Russia, denying any connection to the killing, responded with a tit-for-tat move. According to German prosecutors, the suspect shot Kavtarashvili from behind on a bicycle, firing two shots from a Glock 26 pistol equipped with a silencer. After the victim fell to the ground, Krasikov is accused of then shooting him in the head, killing him on the spot, before getting back on his bicycle and fleeing. Police divers later recovered the handgun, a wig and a bicycle from the nearby Spree river. Calling for Krasikov to be jailed for life as they summed up their case last week, prosecutors said they had identified him as a ""commander of a special unit of Russian secret services FSB."" ""He liquidated a political opponent,"" prosecutor Lars Malkies told the court. But in an earlier hearing, the defendant had told the court through his lawyer Robert Unger that he should be identified only as Vadim Sokolov, who is ""Russian, single and a construction engineer."" He denied being known as Krasikov, saying ""I know of no one by this name."" Prosecutors say the defendant traveled as a tourist in the days before the murder, arriving on Aug. 17 in Paris where he visited sights before traveling to Warsaw. Photos of his tourist cover were found on a mobile phone in the Polish hotel where he stayed before heading to Berlin on Aug. 22. The trial has spanned a period of particularly rocky ties between Berlin and Moscow over a series of espionage cases, as well as the poisoning and jailing of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. Russia denies all allegations. The verdict also comes as Russia stands accused by the West of planning an invasion of Ukraine and massing tens of thousands of troops near its neighbor's border. Germany's new government has taken a sharp tone with Moscow, warning that it will not approve the controversial Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia in the event of any new ""escalation"" in Ukraine. Chancellor Olaf Scholz issued a fresh warning on Wednesday, saying Russia would pay ""a high price"" if it invaded its neighbor. Russian President Vladimir Putin has described the Tiergarten victim as a ""fighter, very cruel and bloody"" who had joined separatists against Russian forces in the Caucasus and also been involved in bombing attacks on the Moscow metro. Moscow also said it had been seeking his extradition. According to German media, the victim survived two assassination attempts in Georgia before seeking asylum in Germany, where he had been living for several years.",1,690,97.77,68.03,27.24,1,22.26,30,75.8,54.93,43.62,5.8,3.33,0.14,0.14,0,2.32,0.43,2.46,14.49,10.29,2.32,17.39,4.2,2.17,5.22,0.29,10.58,4.49,2.46,8.41,1.01,0.29,7.1,5.36,0.43,4.93,2.32,0.43,0.43,0.43,0.14,1.16,0,6.67,1.3,5.22,0.72,0,0.58,0.14,0.29,0,0.14,13.48,6.52,0.14,0.14,2.46,1.01,3.04,6.38,0,0,0.14,2.32,5.36,2.75,2.17,0.43,2.17,0,0.29,1.59,0.29,0,1.88,0.29,0.14,0,0,0,0,0,1.3,0,0,0.29,0.14,0,0,0,0.43,0,1.3,10.29,0.72,1.88,7.97,0,0.14,0,4.06,5.8,1.45,0.58,0,0,0,0,0,15.8,4.49,5.51,0,0,1.16,4.64

Dmitry Muratov, editor-in-chief of the independent Novaya Gazeta newspaper, accepted the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo on Friday. He and Philippine journalist Maria Ressa received the honor for their commitments to protecting press freedom. Muratov, whose newsroom has had several of its journalists killed in connection with their reporting, dedicated his award to his slain colleagues and decried growing threats to freedom and human rights in Russia and its neighboring countries. Here are the main highlights from his acceptance speech: — “There is a saying in Russian and English and other languages: ‘When the dogs bark, but the caravan keeps walking.’ One explanation is that nothing can hinder the progress of a caravan. The government sometimes derisively says the same about journalists. They bark, but it does not affect anything. But I was recently told that the saying has an opposite explanation. The caravan drives forward because the dogs bark. They growl and savage the predators in the mountains and the desert. The caravan can move forward only with the dogs around. Yes, we growl and bite. Yes, we have sharp teeth and a strong grip. But we are the prerequisite for progress. We are the antidote against tyranny.” — “​​There are two contradicting trends in Russia today. On the one hand, Russia’s president supports the erection of a monument to Sakharov’s 100th anniversary. On the other hand, Russia’s Prosecutor General demands the elimination of the international organization Memorial. ... But Memorial was established by Sakharov. Memorial is not an ‘enemy of the people.’ Memorial is a friend of the people.” — “We hear more and more often about torture of convicts and detainees. … I am now presenting an initiative of setting up an international tribunal against torture, which will have the task to gather information on torture in different parts of the world and different countries, and to identify the executioners and the authorities involved in such crimes. Of course, I shall rely first and foremost on investigative journalists around the world. Torture must be recognized as the most serious crime against humanity.” — “Hybrid warfare and the tragic, ugly and criminal story of the Boeing MH17 have ruined relations between Russia and Ukraine, and I do not know if the next generations will be able to restore them … Moreover, in the heads of some crazy geopoliticians, a war between Russia and Ukraine is not something impossible any longer. But I know that wars end with identifying soldiers and exchanging prisoners.” — “Journalism in Russia is going through a dark valley. Over a hundred journalists, media outlets, human rights defenders and NGOs have recently been branded as ‘foreign agents.’ In Russia, this means ‘enemies of the people.’ Many of our colleagues have lost their jobs. Some have to leave the country.” — “I can probably — as always — get questions like: why did your colleagues go there? Yes, to witness. To prove. To see it with their own eyes. Because as the great war photographer Robert Capa said: ‘If your picture isn’t good enough, you aren’t close enough.’ — “‘Aren’t you afraid?’ is the most common question my colleagues get. But this is their mission. As governments continually improve the past, journalists try to improve the future.” — “Let us rise and honor my and Maria Ressa's reporter colleagues, who have given their lives for this profession, with a minute of silence, and let us give our support to those who suffer persecution. I want journalists to die old.”",1,576,80.15,47.26,49.53,3.61,13.09,26.91,86.63,64.06,51.74,9.03,6.6,1.56,1.56,0.69,0.69,1.56,2.43,17.19,9.72,1.22,12.85,6.94,3.13,7.47,1.39,13.54,6.94,2.95,7.99,2.6,1.91,3.47,11.98,1.22,10.76,2.43,0.69,1.22,1.74,0.87,5.03,0,7.29,2.43,4.69,1.56,0.17,1.22,0.17,0,0.17,0,12.85,5.73,0.35,0,1.91,1.22,1.56,6.94,0,0,0,0.69,1.56,1.39,0.17,0,4.69,0,0.17,4.51,0,0,2.43,0,0,0,0,0,0.17,0,1.22,0.35,0.17,1.04,0,0.52,0,0.35,0.35,0,4.86,9.38,0,1.22,6.42,1.04,0.69,0.17,3.3,2.43,5.21,1.22,0.52,0,0.52,0,0,19.97,8.16,4.51,0.35,0,2.26,4.69

Now that thaw is definitively over. The political crisis that broke out following the contested presidential election of 2020, the European ban on EU aircraft flying over Belarus following the forced landing of a Ryanair plane in May, and Lukashenko’s pro-Russian lurch mean Minsk is no longer an acceptable stage for negotiations. The achievements of five years of an actively multi-vectoral foreign policy by Minsk from 2014 to 2019 have lost value. The bonuses that Belarus earned by distancing itself from Russia have vanished and will not return any time soon, given the extent of the West’s dismay over human rights abuses in Belarus. And if Minsk had continued to pretend to be neutral in the current situation, it would have risked eliciting the ire of Moscow too. Today, Lukashenko is dependent on the Kremlin’s goodwill and deep pockets for two key issues: how peaceful and smooth the rest of his time in power will be, and the future power transition. Minsk’s priority, therefore, is to win Moscow’s benevolence while giving up as little sovereignty as possible in exchange. Lukashenko has decided to go about this using two methods: making strong symbolic gestures on the one hand, such as recognizing Crimea as part of Russia, and dragging Russia even further into its geopolitical standoff with the West on the other. After all, Moscow will be far more willing to open its coffers for a proud bastion standing in the way of Moscow’s enemies than for an ally that is constantly performing a balancing act and which simply wants to live well without bothering to reform its economy. For Lukashenko, therefore, it’s important that his own standoff with the West should be perceived in Moscow not simply as the petty squabbles of a minor Eastern European state, but as part of a major NATO crusade against Russia and its friends. This is why Lukashenko has started resorting to the verbal rattling of Russian sabers, trying to involve Moscow in his own disputes with Belarus’s neighbors amid a series of belligerent, anti-Western statements, such as raising the possibility of returning Russian nuclear weapons to Belarusian territory, twenty-five years after they were removed. There are two possible explanations as to why Lukashenko has spoken out now on Crimea and launched his latest crusade against the West. The first explanation is that negotiations are under way on a new $3 billion loan for Minsk from the Eurasian Development Bank, which is controlled by Moscow. The second is that in a recent speech to senior Foreign Ministry officials, Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly said that Moscow is in favor of a dialogue between the authorities and the opposition in Belarus. Like many analysts, the Belarusian authorities likely interpreted Putin’s advice as a sign of displeasure, which could have been incurred by Minsk’s attempts to turn the drawn-out process of constitutional reform promised to Moscow into a mechanism for extending Lukashenko’s rule under a new title. In any case, it’s not a good idea to upset Russia over anything right now, while loans are being discussed and the West is introducing new sanctions against Belarus, which will require joint efforts by Minsk and Moscow to circumvent. Belarus’s neighbors — Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine — have long viewed the Belarusian authorities as a puppet regime controlled by Russia. Accordingly, the reaction to Lukashenko’s comments on Crimea was fairly muted. The EU and United States paid no heed, occupied instead with passing new sanctions against Minsk for instigating the migrant crisis on Belarus’s borders. There will be consequences for the relationship between Belarus and Ukraine, of course, but a complete breaking off of relations is unlikely. Most probably, Kiev will scale down its representation in Minsk by sending home the Belarusian ambassador and recalling its own. If Lukashenko visits Crimea in violation of Ukrainian law, as he has promised to, new personal sanctions are a possibility, along with trade wars, but Kiev is not prepared to go without its main Belarusian import: petrochemicals. Belarusian refineries send about 40 percent of their petrochemicals (gasoline, diesel, and bitumen) to neighboring Ukraine, which has no potential replacement for them in the foreseeable future. Nor is it likely that the West will impose additional sanctions specifically over Belarus’s recognition of Crimea. Restrictions are imposed over threats to regional stability, such as the forced landing of the Ryanair plane or the situation with the migrants on the Belarusian-Polish border. Against this backdrop, Lukashenko’s rhetoric about Russian territorial disputes with its neighbors pales in comparison. Given that Lukashenko had nothing left to lose in relations with the West and Ukraine, his recognition of Crimea is unlikely to herald a breakthrough in relations with the Kremlin. Support for Russia’s position on Crimea would have been appreciated back when it would have incurred a cost for Minsk. But a friendly gesture made out of despair, when Belarus’s multi-vectoral foreign policy has stopped yielding fruit, smacks of insincerity. In any case, the recognition of Crimea as Russian territory could easily be reversed by a future government eager to distance itself from the previous regime, whose very legitimacy is in doubt. For Moscow, of course, any crisis in the relationship between Minsk and Kiev is a bonus. It reduces the chance of any kind of coordinated action by these two neighbors — both transit countries for Russian gas supplies to Europe — in the future, as well as leaving Minsk with less room to maneuver and decreasing its chances of returning to any kind of multi-vectoral foreign policy. Only time will tell whether this move by Minsk will impact on Moscow’s financial generosity. The Belarusian state is due to pay off $3.4 billion in debts next year, and more than $4 billion in 2023. Taking into account the effect of Western sanctions and the state of Minsk’s foreign currency reserves, new Russian loans are absolutely essential. In September, Putin promised $630 million by the end of 2022. Clearly that won’t be enough, so Lukashenko’s Crimea diplomacy and, more importantly, the Kremlin’s reluctance to drive its ally to default and chaos mean Minsk can likely count on a larger sum. The problem is that Lukashenko will have to provide Moscow with constant reminders of his loyalty, and following his recognition of Crimea, he is running out of options for further rhetorical and symbolic concessions. Going forward, he will either have to sacrifice something sacred like state property or aspects of sovereignty, or escalate affairs with Belarus’s neighbors to such an extent that the Kremlin won’t be able to remain on the sidelines. For now, it looks like Lukashenko is leaning toward the second option, making that the biggest source of risk to the region today.

""The hysteria unrolled in the West on this topic shows, first of all, the jealousy of some European cities and states towards Africa and the Middle East, whose sovereignty and independence they were once forced to recognise,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. It added that Moscow may respond to the ""unfriendly"" move. On Monday, European foreign ministers agreed to slap sanctions on targets linked to Wagner — a secretive company accused of acting to destabilise Ukraine and parts of Africa. They approved a list of eight names and three companies associated with Wagner to be added immediately to existing sanctions regimes. The West says the group works on behalf of the Kremlin in conflict zones. In its statement, the ministry said ""private military companies are not under the control of official Russian authorities."" It added that independent countries — ""assessing their own security capabilities"" — have the right to work with such companies. ""The European Union casts doubt on the sovereign right of these UN member states to build an independent and domestic foreign policy,"" the ministry said. ""Russia reserves the right to respond to the unfriendly actions of the EU,"" it added. Wagner is said to be financed by Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, who has already been hit with EU and U.S. sanctions for destabilising Libya and meddling in US elections. In addition to the Wagner firm and three linked companies, the sanctions list targeted eight individuals, including the group's alleged commander.

",English,Russia,"Did anyone really think a two-hour video conversation between Presidents Putin and Biden was really going to bring a breakthrough? Of course, it didn’t. Nonetheless, it is worth considering just what such a personal connection can and can’t do. Of course, all we know about the conversation, beyond the first few seconds, is from the respective sides’ statements, so it’s simply a question of whose spin you want to believe. Washington’s brief readout struck a minatory tone, saying that Biden “reiterated his support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and called for de-escalation and a return to diplomacy,” and warning that “the U.S. and our Allies would respond with strong economic and other measures in the event of military escalation.” While Putin said the conversation was “very open, substantive, and constructive,” Moscow’s own rather lengthier summary offered — unsurprisingly — a rather different interpretation. It said that while “Biden, in turn, focused on what he described as “threatening” movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border… Putin warned against shifting the responsibility on Russia, since it was NATO that was undertaking dangerous attempts to gain a foothold on Ukrainian territory, and building up its military capabilities along the Russian border.” In particular, it emphasized Moscow’s new big-picture demand: that this crisis be resolved not simply with Kiev’s return to the Minsk process in the ways understood by Russia, but also with steps towards the creation of a new European security architecture, starting with “reliable, legally binding guarantees ruling out the eventuality of NATO’s eastward expansion and the deployment of offensive weapons systems in the countries neighboring Russia.” To some hawks in the West, President Biden’s willingness even to talk to his Russian counterpart was a concession. This is a deeply dangerous contention, as dialogue and diplomacy are precisely at their most valuable with those with whom one disagrees and in times of the greatest tension. A more reasonable criticism is that nothing new came of the conversation. The various sanctions Biden presumably outlined are unlikely to be different from the options already openly discussed, from extending controls on Russian banks’ access to credit markets to finally blocking Nord Stream 2. Likewise, Putin does not seem to have offered any new concessions or potential diplomatic solutions. The Kremlin and its usual mouthpieces have been floating the need for some more comprehensive security deal for some time now, and Russian forces are still building up around Ukraine’s borders. It’s good to talk However, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan affirmed after the event that “there is no substitute for direct dialogue between leaders, and that is true in spades when it comes to the U.S.-Russia relationship” and he is right. It would be a mistake to consider the conversation futile and fruitless. First of all, whatever was said, the simple fact that there was such a conversation matters. The Kremlin has internalized — and not without reason — that it is only really heard by the Americans when it makes a fuss and creates a problem. Putin’s people had been pushing for this contact and had it continued to be denied, there would have been a temptation for them to escalate in some way — though certainly not to the level of major military action — simply to make their case more compelling. Secondly, there is scope for some kind of human rapport. Foreign policy is at once dominated by intractable global processes and also deeply personal. Although there is no prospect of any kind of odd couple affinity as blossomed between Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan, for example, perhaps one of Biden’s only particular strengths appears to be his affability. To the best of my knowledge, no scholar has written specifically on the role of geniality in geopolitics (watch me be proven wrong). However, if he was able to convey not just toughness but also a genuine desire for dialogue — rather than, as the Kremlin sees it, the usual American assumption of automatic righteousness — then this may, in some admittedly very small way, offset the hawkish chorus Putin has installed around himself. Finally, as during the Geneva face-to-face summit, the conversation between presidents unlocks further, quieter, more technical discussions by their specialists. Sullivan noted that the U.S. and its “European allies would engage in a discussion that covers larger strategic issues, including our strategic concerns with Russia and Russia’s strategic concerns” — so long as Russia did not escalate. Putin clearly has some strange and unhealthy notions about Ukraine and the Ukrainian people that preclude them true agency and sovereignty. He is also by no means alone in believing that the West duped Moscow over NATO expansion, hence his likely unachievable desire for cast iron guarantees about what would, in effect, be the enforced ‘Finlandisation’ of Ukraine. At the same time, the nature of haggling is that both parties start with extreme bids, expecting to be negotiated towards the middle. It may well be that the gap is unbridgeable, and in any case this is not simply a deal to be struck between Moscow and Washington — it is not for either of them to dispose of Ukraine’s fate.

Russian respondents’ approval of the president’s job performance dropped to 63% in November from 67% in October, according to the Levada Center pollster. Putin ordered a nationwide partial lockdown from Oct. 30-Nov. 7 in a bid to slow the virus’ spread after placing most Covid-19 response decisions in the hands of regional leaders for much of the pandemic. According to Levada, 57% of its respondents approved of their regional leaders in November, while 38% did not. Putin’s approval has yet to return to the highs it enjoyed following Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, as unpopular pension reforms and lagging living standards have fueled public discontent. While he has repeatedly urged Russians to get vaccinated with one of the country's Covid-19 vaccines amid widespread vaccine hesitancy, Putin still opposes the idea of mandatory vaccination. Key Putin allies who typically maintain relative popularity also saw their approval ratings drop from October to November, with Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin’s indicators both falling by 2%. Nearly half of respondents, 46%, said Russia is moving in the right direction. A slightly smaller share, 44%, expressed the opposite opinion, Levada said.

Spy Plane Nearly Caused Mid - Air  Catastrophe  ",English,Russia,"Moscow has said that a U.S. plane threatened civilian aircraft but ""catastrophe"" was avoided when a Russian passenger plane dived to avoid the NATO reconnaissance aircraft that crossed its path above the Black Sea. On Friday morning a NATO CL600 reconnaissance aircraft descended rapidly across the planned route for a Tel Aviv to Moscow Aeroflot service with 142 people on board, Russia's Federal Air Transport Agency said in a statement. The Aeroflot flight reportedly had to drop 500 meters (1,600 feet) to keep its distance from the reconnaissance aircraft, which the pilots saw from the cockpit with the naked eye. A second plane, a smaller CL650 aircraft, flying from the Black Sea resort Sochi to Skopje, the capital of Northern Macedonia, also had to divert to avoid the spy plane, the Russian air transport authority said Saturday. ""The direction and altitude of the commercial flights were immediately altered"" to avoid a collision, the agency said, adding that the unknown plane did not respond to radio hails from air traffic control. While the Federal Air Transport Agency did not say which nation had operated the spy plane, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova indicated on Sunday that the reconnaissance aircraft belonged to the United States. ""The actions of the U.S. Air Force have created a threat to civil aviation,"" Zakharova said on messaging app Telegram. ""If now a catastrophe in the airspace over the open waters of the Black Sea has been averted, this does not mean that the United States and NATO can continue to risk people's lives with impunity."" The Federal Air Transport Agency said it would lodge a diplomatic protest. ""Increased activity by NATO aircraft near Russia's borders, including above the Black Sea, creates a risk of dangerous accidents involving civilian aircraft,"" the agency said. The incident came as tensions rise between Russia and Western nations, which accuse Moscow of massing troops on its border with Ukraine in preparation for a possible invasion.

S . as Ukraine Tensions Soar,English,Russia,"President Vladimir Putin said Russia has sent the United States its proposals on mutual security guarantees amid high tensions between the countries over Ukraine, Interfax reported Wednesday. Russia’s Foreign Ministry passed the offer to U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Karen Donfried, who is in Moscow after visiting Kiev amid fears of Russia invading Ukraine. Putin reiterated his request to “immediately launch negotiations” with the U.S. and NATO on international legal guarantees for Russia’s security. Putin previously informed his Finnish counterpart of the offer. “The president expressed hope that the Americans and NATO members will respond positively to this,” Interfax quoted Putin’s senior foreign policy aide Yury Ushakov as saying. Putin’s demands include stopping NATO from expanding east, including closing Ukraine's door to membership, and halting its deployment of weapons in neighboring states. Ushakov said Putin informed Chinese President Xi Jinping of the U.S. and NATO security guarantee proposal during virtual talks Wednesday. “The Chinese president stressed that he […] fully supports our initiative to develop appropriate security guarantees for Russia,” Interfax quoted him as saying. Putin’s aide added that the Russian leader agreed to keep Xi informed “about how negotiations develop on this matter with American and NATO partners.” Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov has previously warned that Moscow could act militarily if the talks it demands do not materialize. U.S. President Joe Biden last week warned Putin of ""sanctions like he's never seen"" should the Russian troops massed on the Ukrainian border launch an attack.

Putin is sensitive to the perceived expansion of Western military ambitions into ex-Soviet countries and Russia this week demanded that NATO formally scrap a 2008 decision to open its door to Georgia and Ukraine. The end of the Union brought with it a period of intense economic instability that plunged many into poverty, as newly independent Russia transitioned from communism to capitalism. RIA Novosti, reporting from excerpts of the documentary, said Putin had revealed that he worked occasionally as a taxi driver to boost his income. ""Sometimes I had to earn extra money,"" Putin said. ""I mean, earn extra money by car, as a private driver. It's unpleasant to talk about to be honest but, unfortunately, that was the case.""

The Dec. 1-3 drills along the Strait of Malacca on the northeastern coast of Sumatra involve all 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Russia dispatched the large anti-submarine ship Admiral Panteleev for the marine phase of the two-part virtual and marine exercises. Agence France Presse reported that these were the first ever joint Russian-ASEAN naval exercises. According to the state-run TASS news agency, Rear Adm. Abdul Rasyid, the Indonesian Navy’s commander of the first fleet, said the maneuvers will “strengthen friendship” and “interaction and mutual understanding” between Russia and ASEAN. “These exercises are about peace, stability and prosperity in the region,” said Russia’s ambassador to ASEAN Alexander Ivanov. “We’re opening a new page in our strategic partnership,” added Ivanov, who attended the opening ceremony with Russia’s Ambassador to Indonesia Lyudmila Vorobyova. The Russian-ASEAN exercises are taking place against the backdrop of the Southeast Asian states’ growing tensions with China around its claim of the entire South China Sea. Russia has been forging closer ties with China since its relations with Western nations soured after it annexed Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula and is being accused of backing pro-Moscow rebels in the country’s southeast.

S . ",English,Russia,"The United States on Saturday urged Russia to pull back from the brink over Ukraine, warning that the G7 and its allies will impose tough measures if it abandons diplomacy. A senior State Department official told reporters at a meeting of the grouping's top diplomats in Liverpool, northwest England, that Moscow still had time to change course. ""But if they choose not to pursue that path, there will be massive consequences and severe costs in response, and the G7 is absolutely united in that,"" the official said. ""A large number of democratic countries will join us in imposing costs,"" they added. The warning came as Russian sabre-rattling against Ukraine and how to counter an increasingly assertive China dominated the first day of a two-day meeting of G7 foreign ministers in the British city. The meeting — at which ministers want to present a united front against authoritarianism — is the last in-person gathering of Britain's year-long G7 presidency, before it hands the baton to Germany. Opening the talks, Britain's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told delegates: ""We need to come together strongly to stand up to aggressors who are seeking to limit the bounds of freedom and democracy. ""To do this, we need to have a fully united voice. We need to expand our economic and security posture around the world."" Truss, in the job since September, set out her foreign policy vision in a major address on Wednesday, echoing U.S. threats of unprecedented sanctions if Russia invades Ukraine. Western concerns are growing over a Russian troop build-up on the border that the Kremlin says is defensive against any move by the former Soviet state eastwards towards NATO. G7 ministers want to show the grouping can move beyond condemnation to robustly defend its values as a deterrent to future threats. The meeting comes after U.S. President Joe Biden this week held a virtual summit with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to try to end the stand-off diplomatically.

Germany imports around 40% of its gas from Russia and is set to receive even more via Nord Stream 2, a project that has raised U.S. concerns, divided Europe and angered EU ally Ukraine.",1,307,94.79,76.72,13.54,55.75,25.58,32.57,76.87,57.33,42.02,5.86,4.89,0.33,0.98,0.65,1.63,0.98,0.98,12.05,7.82,1.63,16.29,3.58,3.26,6.51,0,9.77,6.84,2.28,6.51,2.93,0.33,3.26,7.82,0,7.17,0.33,0.65,0.98,0.33,0.98,1.63,0,6.84,4.56,2.28,1.95,0.65,0.98,0,0.65,0,0,14.98,9.12,3.91,1.63,0.33,0,3.91,6.84,0,0.33,0.98,0.65,5.21,2.93,2.28,0,2.61,0,0,1.95,0.98,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.33,0.65,0,0,0,0,0.33,1.3,1.63,8.47,0.65,1.3,6.84,0.33,0,0,4.23,4.23,1.63,0.65,0.33,0.33,0,0,0,17.92,4.56,4.89,0,0,1.3,7.17
392,themoscowtimes.com,1639555200,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/12/15/russias-third-cold-war-a75822,Russia Third Cold War - The Moscow Times,English,Russia,"While discussions abound on the internet concerning the results of the recent talks between President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Joe Biden — and with most suggesting that the Kremlin once again “outmaneuvered” his opponent by forcing the White House to assure the world of its adherence to the so-called Minsk Agreements and agree to freeze military aid to Ukraine — I would like to note that Russia has already effectively entered into a new Cold War with the West: a conflict that resembles not only the major Cold War of 1947-1986, but also the minor one of 1830-1856. A number of parallels exist between today’s events and those of the past. In each instance, Russia acted from a position of imagined moral superiority. Almost 200 years ago, it stood for “preserving the foundation” and conserving monarchical orders in Europe, defending that system from all manner of “nihilists.” After World War II, it spoke of the triumph of communism as the most progressive social system. Now, the Kremlin is repeating the idea that Russia stands in opposition to the pernicious and immoral West, that it is once again the defender of traditional values which the West is liable to desecrate. And each time, the confrontation began when Russia “bullied” Western proxies. In the first Cold War, this involved Russia’s suppression of the uprising in Poland in 1830, the revolution in Hungary in 1848 and the ultimatum in 1853 that Turkey grant a protectorate over its dominions inhabited primarily by Russian Orthodox. The second, larger Cold War began with the Soviet satellite states refusing to participate in the Marshall Plan and blockading West Berlin in 1947. Most recently, tensions escalated when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and undermined Ukraine’s territorial integrity through military intervention in Donbass in 2014-2015. And each time, events did not escalate into a “hot” or direct shooting war. Instead, the conflicts were limited to a peripheral theater of operations — such as the Crimean campaign of the 1850s; played out wherever in the world the interests of the warring parties clashed — as happened in the second half of the 20th century; or, as is happening now, boil down to the activities of quasi-military formations over which one side claims it has no control — and various types of terrorist actions. We shouldn’t forget that each time, Russia or the Soviet Union lacked the economic and technological might that would have given it the upper hand in the ensuing confrontation. Although Moscow has had the capability to wipe its enemy off the face of the earth ever since it developed nuclear weapons in the mid-20th century, it would have also been blown to smithereens in the process, with the result that it was unable to win any of these “cold wars,” and each of its defeats ended in a serious crisis of the entire social model of both the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union. However obvious these parallels might appear, Russia has made the same mistakes every time. First, it has earned a reputation in Europe and the West as an “evil empire” — if not through openly hostile actions, then through domestic policies and ideological aspirations — with which cooperation was, by definition, considered impossible. Second, in each of these “cold wars,” Russia found itself either alone or supported by only strategically insignificant satellite states, while it was opposed by an alliance of powerful and influential countries, thus foreordaining a pitiable outcome to the struggle. Third, this country reacted to each “cold war” by tightening the screws on its domestic policy, reducing freedoms and leading society into a kind of stupor that only ended when the federal authorities lost power during a subsequent episode of the confrontation with the West. Fourth — and this partly follows from the third point — as the conflict deepened, the Russian authorities increasingly lost touch with reality, leading them to make the mistakes that “broke the camel’s back” — the occupation of Moldova and Wallachia in 1853 and Afghanistan in 1979. In my opinion, we cannot separate what is happening now from the previous “cold wars” or the obvious lessons to be learned from them. Russia has repeatedly behaved impatiently and aggressively, while the West — that many Russian liberals now accuse of defeatism and conciliation — initially perceived those confrontations with St. Petersburg and Moscow as a long process in which their developing societies would inevitably prevail over the stagnant Russian or Soviet ones.

Held at Gostiny Dvor Dec. 2-6, it offers fiction, non-fiction, and pop science literature from 18 countries (including Israel, China, U.K., U.S, Ukraine, France and Japan); from 300 major publishing houses; with more than 500 special events and talks by authors and publishers from around the world; for upwards of 40,000 visitors every year, some of whom are also budding authors who sign contracts right on the spot. If you love books, you must go to this book fair. This year the special guest country is Germany, which means lots of books, authors, films, talks and other events in German and from Germany. There is a big section of kid’s books, one for comics and graphic novels, and a growing section of cookbooks.  Buy your ticket(s) ahead of time, dust off your book bags, take a look at the program of talks, demonstrations, and seminars, and plan your weekend. There are plenty of foreign language books and lots of foreign authors despite the coronavirus and other travel restrictions. More information in Russian and English and ticket purchases on the site here. The holiday season might be subdued this year in Moscow — like last year, there will be no fairs or activities in the city center — but that doesn’t mean you’ll have to sit home watching “It’s a Wonderful Life” on Netflix. On Dec. 24 you might want to experience the brilliance and triumph of Dmitry Shostakovich’s “Seventh Symphony,” also called the “Leningrad Symphony.” It will be performed on the main stage of the Zaryadye Concert Hall by the Russian State Orchestra, directed by Vasily Petrenko.  And on Dec. 25 at 1 p.m. the Cantus Boy’s Choir is performing a Christmas concert on the small stage. The choir is one of the finest in Russia, dedicated to the long tradition of church choral music in Russia. The program will be Russian and European Christmas music, although it ends of the very festive and light notes of “Jingle Bells” and “Jingle Bell Rock.” For more information and tickets, see the concert hall site. In many parts of the world, there is nothing that says “holidays” more than teddy bears. In some families children get new bears every year. In others, the parents do, too. Whether or not this is a tradition in your family, the Hello, Teddy exhibition will put you and your children in a bearish good mood. At Tishinka mall you can see 50,000 teddy bears, from some so small you can only see them under a microscope, to some so big you couldn’t pick them up. The stuffed bears have their friends on display, too: rabbits, badgers, foxes,  mice and other forest creatures. For more information and tickets, see the site here. This year on the first day of Hanukah, the Jewish Museum and Tolerance Center opened a very hands-on exhibition called Becoming Jewish. With artifacts — some quite rare — from private and public collections in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other parts of Russia, children are introduced to the traditions, holidays and games that once were part of most Jewish children’s lives in this part of the world. The curators worked on the exhibition for two years, designing it as one grand board game that will grab children’s interest and teach them while letting them be entertained. The show will run for four months until Purim. While you’re there, be sure to see the show “Snow on Grass” of works by the great animator Yuri Norshtein and the artist Francesca Norbusova. For more information about the show, see the site here. Maybe to compensate for the pandemic cancellations of holiday fairs and activities, maybe to make up for the cold slush and snow, or maybe just because Muscovites love jazz, there is something of a world-wide jazz festival this month. Tonight, Dec. 3 at 8 p.m., the Italian jazz band Conosci mia cugina has flown in from Rome to perform at Artnovi Space. Think swing. Tickets are 2,000 rubles and available here. If Italy isn’t hot enough for you, how about Brazil? On Sunday evening at 7:30 p.m. the rooftop restaurant-club Krym is hosting a Russian jazz group that has made the Bosa Nova their own. Tickets ranging from 1,500-1,700 rubles are available here.",1,732,86.89,61.96,27.07,65.45,17.43,20.9,81.15,59.29,48.22,6.15,3.42,0,0,2.32,0,0.82,2.73,14.62,7.79,3.42,14.62,5.87,4.37,6.97,0.82,11.07,6.28,6.15,1.91,0.96,0.55,0.55,7.65,0.68,6.69,1.23,0.55,0.68,1.64,0,3.14,0,3.83,3.28,0.41,0.96,0.68,0.14,0,0,0.14,0,7.51,1.78,0.14,0.14,0,0,0.96,5.33,0.27,0.27,0,0.14,1.37,0,1.37,0,8.61,3.96,0.27,2.87,0.55,0.96,0.82,0.27,0.27,0,0,0,0,0.27,0,0.41,0.14,0.68,0,0.27,0,0.14,0,0.14,6.42,11.2,0.27,0.96,7.24,1.91,0.82,0.41,2.87,1.23,4.23,1.78,0.68,0.68,0.14,0,0,20.08,6.56,8.06,0.14,0,1.5,3.83

The unlikely artist is Viktor Bout, also known as the “merchant of death,” a former Russian arms dealer serving a 25-year sentence in a U.S. jail who was the inspiration for the 2005 Hollywood movie ""Lord of War"" starring Nicolas Cage. “We held the exhibition to show that Viktor still has the will to go on, despite his difficult situation,” said Bout’s wife Alla, who runs the Road to Home foundation which lobbies for her husband’s release. Alla also said she hoped the exhibition would keep her husband in the news. “It is also important to remind people that he is still in jail, a lot of time has passed since he was first arrested,” she added. Bout, a former army lieutenant, has so far spent 11 years in an American prison after his 2008 arrest in Thailand in an elaborate sting operation, during which U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents posed as Colombian Marxist rebels seeking to buy an arsenal of modern weapons. Throughout his incarceration, Bout has been linked repeatedly with prisoner swaps involving Americans jailed in Russia. Most recently, reports have emerged that Bout could be exchanged for Paul Whelan, a former security official at an auto parts company who was arrested in December 2018 on charges of espionage, or Trevor Reed, who was arrested in 2019 for a brawl in which he punched two Russian police officers. However, as the threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine has become a global talking point over the last month, it’s unlikely the topic of prisoner exchange will be raised during Tuesday’s high-stakes virtual summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his U.S. counterpart Joe Biden. U.S. prosecutors have alleged that Bout's weapons fueled armed conflicts in some of the world's bloodiest hot spots, including Rwanda, Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Bout has always insisted he was a legitimate businessman. The Moscow exhibition includes 24 of Bout’s portraits, landscapes and still lives — including a number of self portraits behind bars featuring his signature mustache. The works are in pencil, ballpoint pen, pastels, wax crayons and oil paints provided by the United States Penitentiary in Marion. Alla Bout said each drawing “had a very difficult path to Russia,” having been flown into the country by Russian diplomatic staff. “Viktor would send the drawings to the Russian embassy in Washington and our diplomats would take one of the pieces every time they flew home on holiday,” she said. The exhibition opened on Monday, with a number of government-linked guests in attendance, including Maria Butina, the high-profile gun rights activist who spent 15 months in U.S. prison after admitting to working as an unregistered Russian agent. Butina, who returned to Russia in October 2019 and now has a seat in Russia’s parliament, has been one of Bout’s most vocal supporters. “When I saw the painting I felt the pain Bout is going through. Pain that made me feel I am still behind bars too,” Butina, who runs a foundation supporting Russians jailed abroad, told The Moscow Times by phone. Moscow has regularly slammed Bout’s case as political, pointing to statements made by U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin — who presided over Bout’s case in Manhattan — in an interview with The New York Times in which she said she believed the sentence was “excessive and inappropriate.” “I really hope America will agree to exchange prisoners, including Bout, so that he and others can spend time with his family during Christmas. That would help restore relations that are currently at a low point,” Butina said, adding that she wasn’t expecting the topic to be raised today. Bout’s lawyer Alexei Tarasov said on Monday there has been no progress on the issue of his exchange. “I don’t see any indications that my clients will be discussed at the talks,” the lawyer told the Russian state news agency TASS. And while the exhibition’s main aim is to bring renewed attention to Bout’s case, Alla said Viktor’s hobby has also helped keep him sane during his time behind bars. ""For Viktor himself, this is a kind of meditation, when he can be distracted from the conditions facing him in jail, from the gray walls. Through art he can be transported to some other world, the world of freedom.""",1,738,90.77,63.32,16.43,11.86,27.33,23.58,79.54,57.32,46.34,8.4,5.96,0.95,0.27,0,3.52,0.14,2.44,13.96,8.67,2.03,15.31,7.45,2.85,3.93,0.41,13.69,4.34,3.25,5.42,1.08,0.54,3.79,7.05,0.41,6.37,0.95,0.41,1.36,0.68,0.14,2.03,0.14,3.79,1.49,2.3,0.68,0.41,0.27,0,0,0,0,12.06,4.61,0.27,0.14,0.27,0.41,2.44,7.05,0.41,0.14,1.22,2.71,4.34,2.57,1.49,0.27,5.15,1.08,0.27,2.57,0.68,0.81,1.22,0.68,0.27,0.14,0.14,0,0,0,0.14,0,0.27,0.14,0,0.14,0,0,0.54,0.14,3.52,10.7,0.54,1.76,7.32,0.54,0,0.81,4.61,6.1,4.47,1.08,0.14,0,0.14,0,0,17.48,5.28,6.23,0,0,2.44,3.52

Kennedy who first popularized the saying, “Victory has 100 fathers, but defeat is an orphan”, they like repeating it so much that one might say it has now become part of the Russian culture. However, this adage doesn’t seem to apply to the mass protests for fair elections in 2011-2012 because, although everyone admits that those demonstrations ended in defeat, many people are still vying to be considered the father of that defeat. For the first time in modern Russian history, tens of thousands of indignant citizens took to the streets of Moscow and other large Russian cities and, over many months, peacefully but persistently demanded respect for their rights. One year later, that wave of civic enthusiasm gave way to despondency as the authorities responded with criminal cases and police violence, a crackdown on freedoms, media owners who had indirectly supported the protests replaced with Kremlin loyalists, and public figures who had delivered speeches at the rallies subjected to coordinated harassment. Several non-conformist deputies of the State Duma — the same Duma that had been elected with the help of falsified results — were even forced to leave the country. For all of the next 10 years, we have witnessed the Kremlin’s reaction to the sudden humiliation it suffered back then. The increasingly repressive measures, the spate of criminal cases, the new laws against “foreign agents”, proxy wars and state television’s ever more toxic propaganda — all this is a consequence of those peaceful rallies. And if Russian leaders consider the rally on Bolotnaya Square on Dec. 10, 2011 as “ground zero” in this battle, then they see the country’s intelligentsia as the masterminds behind the attack on their authority and have pushed to alienate it from the state ever since. The Kremlin propaganda machine has waged a war against the intelligentsia, portraying it as the driving force behind the protests, as funded by the West, as pro-gay and pro-Ukraine — in short, as pro-everything that ordinary working Russians oppose. That is why, when the anniversary of those events rolls around every December, all the numerous “fathers” of that defeat among the Russian intelligentsia (yours truly included) engage in painful reflection on the question of what we did wrong. Setting aside the somewhat hackneyed remark that painful reflection has been a hereditary trait of the Russian intelligentsia since the time of Chekhov’s plays, let us ask a better question instead: Is there an error in this logic? When we ask, “Why did the Russian opposition lose in 2011?” we ipso facto assume that it could have won had it made different decisions. Among the alternate scenarios must often cited are if protesters had held an unsanctioned rally outside the Kremlin walls in place of the sanctioned gathering it did hold on Bolotnaya Square — on a strategically inconvenient island in the middle of the Moscow River — and if opposition leaders had not left town over the long New Year’s holiday. But just for a change, maybe we should ask whether protesters ever had any chance at all of winning. It now increasingly appears that they did not. That possibility simply didn’t exist because Russian society was completely different 10 years ago. In 2009-2010, the largest rallies in Russia had brought together only 100-200 people — not counting a riot by violent nationalist football fans. What’s more, the great majority of people had no experience  whatever of political action — with the possible exception of older citizens who had attended rallies during the collapse of the Soviet Union — and protest organizers had no experience providing legal assistance to detainees and financial assistance to individuals and organizations subjected to repression. For today’s 20-year-olds in Russia, sending a donation of even a few dollars a month to help keep persecuted media outlets stay afloat and attending an unsanctioned rally is as natural as brushing your teeth. Ten years ago, this was all new. At that time, civil society was just emerging in Russia. It was in its infancy, naive and overly optimistic. Don’t let your eyes fool you, though. To a casual observer, it seems that little has changed between the Russia of 2011 and that of today. After all, opposition leader Alexei Navalny is behind bars, his organization has been disbanded, all independent media outlets have been branded with the onerous label of foreign agent and, once again, it seems that no one is stirring and all is quiet on the protest front. This is not the case, however. There is a huge difference in today’s society. Ten years ago, politics was not even on the agenda. Yes, many thousands of people took to the streets, but they did so with an underlying complacency. Now, politics is front and center. The fact that citizens’ political demands have been strangled and shoved under the carpet so as not to be an eyesore has only made people angrier. Just imagine: in every major Russian city, there are now thousands of people with experience in direct political action, solidarity, donating to a cause and signing petitions. And if to include their friends, relatives and co-workers in the ranks of these “reserves”, the number is even larger. But most importantly, Russia has accumulated a great deal of emotional baggage, a sort of collective grievance with the authorities. Yes, the Bolotnaya rallies failed. But they couldn’t have succeeded anyway because they were only the starting point. They served as the trigger for two things: the Kremlin’s aggressively repressive policy, but also as a kind of “civil society university”, an impulse to instruct countless members of the intelligentsia and middle class in the ways of political action. It’s like the “thesis and antithesis” of Hegel’s philosophy. And no one knows what the ultimate “synthesis” will be.",1,964,80.78,44.98,42.76,17.81,22.95,27.28,87.24,65.56,52.49,7.88,2.59,0,0.62,0.41,0.1,1.04,5.29,17.22,9.44,2.39,14.11,7.37,4.88,7.05,1.45,12.03,7.99,5.91,7.99,1.76,1.04,5.29,12.45,2.28,9.96,2.07,1.97,0.41,2.28,0.41,3.94,0,6.33,3.01,3.22,1.35,0.21,1.04,0,0.41,0.1,0,10.48,4.88,0.93,0,1.87,0.41,1.87,5.19,0.41,0.1,0,0.41,3.22,1.76,1.24,0.21,2.9,0.62,0.1,1.45,0.62,0.1,0.73,0.41,0.21,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0.1,0,0.52,0,0,0,0.52,0.41,0.21,4.46,7.78,0,1.14,5.6,0.73,0.1,0.21,4.88,5.81,3.73,0.21,0.21,0,0.21,0,0,15.46,4.36,5.81,0.21,0,1.66,3.42

Putin skipped both the G20 and COP26 and an expected trip to China was rescheduled due to Covid, yet the Russian leader has decided to travel to New Delhi. This step is hopefully more than mere symbolism in the traditionally warm Russo-Indian relations and not simply a signal that at a time of increasingly tense relations with the West, Russia has important friends elsewhere in the world. Still, even if Russia’s relations with India are good, in order for them to become great, a major effort is needed. The July 2021 edition of Russia’s National Security Strategy describes relations with New Delhi as a “special privileged strategic partnership,” and discusses them in the same paragraph as Russo-Chinese ties. The personal chemistry between Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is excellent. Recently, Modi has demonstrated India’s interest in economic projects in Russia’s Far East, thus extending New Delhi’s Look East policy all the way to Vladivostok. Over Washington’s objections, India has gone ahead with the purchase of Russian-made S-400 air defense systems, due to be delivered before the end of the year. Modi is also one of only four foreign leaders to have been awarded Russia’s top decoration, the Order of St. Andrew. Ordinary Russians see India as a reliably friendly country with which their own nation has a virtually problem-free relationship. For their part, most Indians regard Russia as a proven friend that in the course of India’s seventy-five years of independence has never caused their country strategic harm. Yet issues are piling up on many fronts, requiring both the Indian and Russian leaderships to rethink, adjust, and upgrade the relationship to make it fit for the twenty-first century environment. In global geopolitical terms, the main issue is that Moscow and New Delhi, traditional friends and longtime allies, now find themselves ever more closely linked to two rival superpowers, China and the United States. Moreover, India’s relations with China following the 2020 border clashes in the Himalayas, and Russia’s with the United States since the 2014 Ukraine crisis, can be described as confrontation. Thus, in a situation when their best friends are bonding with their worst enemies, the main task for both New Delhi and Moscow is to shield the Indo-Russian strategic partnership from the wider and increasingly adverse global context, and uphold mutual trust. In geoeconomic terms, despite ongoing cooperation in areas ranging from nuclear energy to outer space to the Arctic, not to mention armaments development and production, the obvious weakness of the Indo-Russian relationship is its small and stagnant trade volumes. With America and China — despite the bad political relationship with the latter — India, a fast-rising economy, trades to the tune of $100 billion each, while commerce with Russia still languishes around a mere $10 billion. The reason is again plain to see: While 85% of India’s economy is now in private hands, Indo-Russian economic ties still rest on government-to-government agreements. After the old model of Soviet-Indian economic relations collapsed in 1991, trade volumes plummeted. The U.S.S.R. used to be among India’s top three economic partners; the Russian Federation’s current rank is in the twentieth to twenty-fifth range. Still, Russia remains strong in some important niches, above all military-technical cooperation. Since India’s first purchase of Mig-21 fighters back in 1962, arms trade has been the cornerstone of bilateral relations. Yet India’s growing desire to diversify its arms imports and, recently, its clear intention to develop and produce weapons systems itself, have led to a slump in Russia’s share of the Indian arms market. As a result, Russia’s share of that market has shrunk to just under 50%. There is ever stronger competition from Europe and even more so from the United States. For all their professed pivot to Asia, the current Russian elites remain Eurocentric to the core, and have little time for India. Russia’s government-owned corporations and private business actors find it much easier and more profitable to do business with China than with India. Russian media outlets have little presence in India and do a mediocre job of explaining Indian politics and policies to their audiences. The Russian public has very limited knowledge and understanding of what is going on in India. Tourism and cultural contacts have been picking up in recent years, but the pandemic has severely limited them. An effort to revive the practice of inviting Indian students to study at Russian universities, after an initially promising start, has also suffered from Covid-related restrictions. Ironically, India’s elites are also Western-centric, but unlike Russia’s, they are also Western-leaning, and particularly focused on the United States. Their ambition is to become part of the global elite. To them, Russia is not a priority, and interest in it is scant. The Indian media has virtually no correspondents based in Russia. To cover Russia-related issues, Indian media editors usually rely on Western — mostly American and British — reporting and analysis, which is highly critical of Russian policies. Tellingly, India’s vibrant technology sector has very few contacts with Russia and Russians. All these problems are too big to be resolved in a single and short presidential visit. However, they must not be ignored if the Indo-Russian strategic partnership is to live up to its name in the decade ahead. The Russians need to step back and decide what it is they want from the Indian connection, what the opportunities for and obstacles to this desired state of relations are, and what must be done in order to achieve their objectives. From this perspective, three actions are of central importance for Russia as it proceeds along this path: to rethink, to adjust, and to upgrade. Rethink means, above all, seeing India for what it is and where it is headed. Far too many in Russian elite circles still regard India as the third world country that it was during the heyday of Soviet-Indian friendship in the 1960s–1980s. Those people have clearly missed India’s stunning economic and technological success of the past three decades. As a result, Russia should not expect its large neighbor in Eurasia to act as a non-aligned inward-looking nation, keeping a low profile in international relations and behaving like a middle power. Instead, Russians should acknowledge India’s new status and self-image as a great power, its focus on rapid economic development, and its ambition to become a global economic powerhouse and a leader in modern technologies. They need to understand the fundamental reasons behind India’s growing closeness with the United States, and its increasing hostility with China. Thus, a rethink requires a much closer study of modern India, and a deeper understanding of that vast and highly complex nation, which is rising to the level of a world power. This can be achieved by supporting Indian and South Asian studies in Russia; expanding media coverage of Indian political, economic, and diplomatic developments; and promoting scientific, educational, and cultural ties, as well as tourism and other people-to-people connections. Adjust means factoring in all these realities in developing Russia’s own strategy toward India: something that does not currently exist. It is clear that cultivating and developing the strategic partnership should remain the overall objective of this yet-to-be-devised strategy. However, the partnership should be structured and styled as one of equals, with Moscow dropping all residual vestiges of its previously sometimes patronizing attitudes to its Indian counterparts. On the conceptual level, Russia needs to take a second look at New Delhi’s Indo-Pacific strategy. An in-depth strategic dialogue with New Delhi on that subject could dispel Moscow’s presently negative and suspicious attitude to the strategy. The Russians need to accept that New Delhi’s ideas have different sources and objectives than Washington’s similarly titled strategy. Essentially, India’s new strategy is a logical continuation of its Look East policy. By the same token, Moscow could increase mutual trust with New Delhi by working through and patiently dispelling Indian concerns regarding Russia’s strategic ties with China and its situational cooperation with Pakistan. These clarifying discussions could pave the way to engaging New Delhi in a strategic dialogue on Greater Eurasia, which is the strategic framework for Moscow’s approach. One might consider amplifying Russia’s traditionally continental geopolitical concept by adding a maritime element covering the seas and oceans washing Eurasia. For the purposes of a geopolitical dialogue with India, the relevant areas could include the Arctic, the Pacific, and the Indian Ocean — all the way from Murmansk to Mumbai. By the same token, India’s strategy, which so far has been couched predominantly in maritime terms, might get a continental dimension, starting with Afghanistan, Central Asia, and Iran. Creating synergies between Moscow and New Delhi’s strategies in both domains could be a tantalizing proposition. On this basis, Moscow needs to engage more closely with New Delhi as it further fleshes out the idea of a Greater Eurasian partnership. Maintaining strategic partnerships with both India and China at bilateral and trilateral (RIC) levels is crucial for general geopolitical stability in Eurasia. Russia, which has neither the ambition nor the resources to dominate Greater Eurasia, could play a key role in maintaining Eurasian equilibrium, which requires Russo-Indo-Chinese understanding. While being realistic about its partners and their complicated relations, Russia needs to proactively facilitate efforts at better understanding between New Delhi and Beijing, and promote positive interaction among the three great powers. Such interaction is also needed for engagement with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), a key aspect of the Greater Eurasian Partnership. It is even more necessary for building up the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) as a continent-wide dialogue platform. Moreover, close relations with New Delhi would help Moscow in engaging pragmatically on Eurasian/Indo-Pacific issues with Washington and Tokyo, which are linked with New Delhi through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue. Much as India finds Russia’s partnership with China useful for managing its own relations with Beijing, Moscow could use its close relations with New Delhi to weigh in diplomatically on the Indo-Pacific agenda. India, which is genuinely interested in an improved relationship between Russia and the United States, might be useful here. At the global level, Russia would benefit from closer interaction with India not only within the BRICS, but also at the United Nations. On a number of regional issues, from Afghanistan to the Persian Gulf and the broader Middle East, India needs to be treated as Russia’s privileged interlocutor and partner. Sidelining New Delhi, as has occasionally happened in discussions on Afghanistan, should never happen again. New global issues, from the spread of pandemics to climate change and energy transition, open up broad new areas for Russia-India cooperation, even as they require the careful management of differences. Engaging early with each other would favor cooperative elements over competitive ones and make it possible to chart a coordinated approach to what have become vital issues for the world community. Upgrade means elevating Russia’s relations with India to the level of its other strategic partnership: with China. This does not mean that Moscow-New Delhi ties must resemble Moscow-Beijing ones. The two relationships are very different, as is the wider context in which they operate. The idea is above all to explore and exploit economic opportunities, without which relations with India will always lag behind those with China. There have been many attempts to expand Indo-Russian economic ties, but progress in that direction has been painfully slow. Most of these efforts have followed the well-trodden path of government-to-government contracts, which is not to be abandoned. One opportunity at hand that is truly unique is deepening military-technical cooperation. For decades, Russia has been the leading provider of weapons systems for the Indian military. For its part, India is serious in pressing ahead with the Make in India model. It also has much more to offer in terms of advanced technology, particularly in the information sphere. There have been several examples of successful Russo-Indian weapons development and production, like the BrahMos missile. Compared to other weapons producers, Russia is more flexible in engaging collaboratively with others. This is probably the way to go. One has to be realistic. The Indian and Russian economies remain far less complementary than those of China and Russia. The Russian and Indian business communities are largely disinterested in each other’s countries, where they see few opportunities for themselves. This can only be changed by a joint effort in creative thinking. At their upcoming meeting, President Putin and Prime Minister Modi need to stimulate such an effort by ordering an in-depth study of potential areas of cooperation to be conducted in time for their next annual get-together.

Kiev has been battling a pro-Moscow insurgency in two breakaway regions bordering Russia since 2014, when the Kremlin annexed Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula. Russia has massed troops near Ukraine's borders and the West has for weeks accused it of planning an invasion, warning Moscow of massive sanctions should it launch an attack. The Ukrainian army said separatists had targeted its positions with grenade launchers and mortars. ""One serviceman was fatally wounded,"" and another soldier was injured, it said on Facebook. Kiev and its allies accuse Russia of supporting the rebels militarily — claims which Moscow denies. The latest death brings Ukraine's toll in the simmering conflict to 65 since the start of the year, according to an AFP tally based on official figures, compared to a total of 50 in all of 2020. Russia has massed around 100,000 troops on its side of the border. U.S. President Joe Biden warned his Russian counterpart President Vladimir Putin of ""sanctions like he's never seen"" should the troops attack Ukraine.

Apparently Not,English,Russia,"At dinner at the American ambassador’s residence in Moscow some years ago, I asked a former senior foreign policy official if anyone in the Kremlin understood Ukraine.  He replied that someone there understood Ukraine very well.  He then added “but nobody listens to him.” The abject failure of Russian policy toward Ukraine over the past seven years suggests the Kremlin and Vladimir Putin have a flawed understanding of the country. On Dec. 17, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, “Have we [Russia] lost Ukraine as a partner, ally and so on?  At this point, yes, completely.” The Russian leadership presumably did not intend this.  Thus, the question of whether the Kremlin and Putin understand Ukraine.  Many signs suggest that they do not. Putin’s last visit to Kiev occurred in 2013, when he traveled to mark the 1025th anniversary of Kievan Rus’s acceptance of Christianity. In a speech Putin said, “We are all spiritual heirs of what happened here 1025 years ago.  And in this sense we [Ukrainians and Russians] are, without a doubt, one people.” What an utterly tone-deaf statement to make in Ukraine.  Millions of ethnic Ukrainians heard it as a denial of their culture, history and language.  Putin has since often repeated that point. Russia’s use of military force to seize Crimea following the Maidan Revolution could hardly be expected to win over Ukrainian sympathies.  Nor would sparking and sustaining a conflict in Donbas that has now claimed more than 13,000 lives. Shortly after the Russia-Ukraine conflict began in 2014, Putin and other Russians started speaking of “Novorossiya” — the idea that much of eastern and southern Ukraine would rise in revolt against Kiev.  The allure of Novorossiya held sway in Moscow long after it became clear that there was little enthusiasm among Ukrainians for breaking away. Volodymyr Zelenskiy won the Ukrainian presidency in 2019.  He came to office a political novice who comfortably spoke Russian and promised a different approach from that of his predecessor, whom Moscow despised.  Zelensky endorsed the Minsk agreements as the basis for resolving the Donbas conflict and spoke approvingly of the “Steinmeier formula” for moving forward—politically risky steps for the new president given growing frustration and anger in Ukraine about the failure of the Minsk agreements to deliver peace in Donbas. What did that get Zelensky?  Putin agreed to a meeting in December 2019 with the Ukrainian leader, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron.  The meeting produced agreement on a prisoner exchange, a full ceasefire in Donbass and a follow-up meeting in spring 2020.  Only the prisoner exchange occurred. Rather than seek compromise, the Kremlin leaders seemed to calculate that they could force the newcomer to make humiliating concessions. Moscow increasingly took the position that it was not a party to the conflict — despite a Russian signature to the Minsk II agreement — and sought to force Kiev to deal directly with the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk “people’s republics.”  The Kremlin now swats away any request by Zelensky to meet Putin. The unsurprising result:  Zelenskiy’s attitude toward Moscow has hardened.  While he brought to office an ambivalent view of the Ukraine-NATO relationship, he now publicly calls for an early membership path for Ukraine. Kremlin policy has driven Ukraine away.  More than anything else, it has persuaded the Ukrainian government and an increasingly large segment of the Ukrainian population that they can find security and stability only if their country is anchored in institutions such as the European Union and NATO.  The Kremlin appears intent on continuing this course.  Putin released an essay in July in which he all but denied Ukraine’s right to exist as a sovereign nation.  In October, former President Dmitry Medvedev termed talking to Kiev “pointless.” The Russian military has massed tens of thousands of troops and tanks, artillery and other combat vehicles in staging areas near Ukraine, suggesting that Russia is preparing a major military assault. That would not bring Ukraine back to Russia.  It would instead generate more sanctions on Russia, an increased flow of Western arms to Ukraine, a bolstering of NATO military presence near Russia’s borders — and dead Russian soldiers. The Russian military is undoubtedly stronger, but the Ukrainian military would exact a price.  Moreover, Kiev is preparing for partisan warfare, and an early December poll showed that one-third of those asked, including one-fourth in the country’s east, would take up arms if the Russians invade. It is time for the Russian leadership to reexamine the premises on which it has based its approach.  Bad understanding leads to bad policy, and the Kremlin appears poised to make another in a line of mistakes in its approach toward Ukraine.  This one would prove a tragedy for Ukraine … but also for Russia.",1,786,92.88,46.07,38.7,9.28,17.47,31.17,81.17,58.27,46.95,7.51,2.54,0.13,0.38,0,1.15,0.64,4.96,14.89,9.41,1.78,15.52,4.07,3.56,6.23,0.76,10.43,4.71,3.94,7.25,1.27,0.64,5.47,11.96,0.51,11.2,2.04,2.04,1.4,1.91,0.64,3.69,0,4.45,1.65,2.8,1.4,0.25,0.89,0,0.38,0.13,0,10.94,5.6,0.64,0.13,1.15,0,2.42,5.22,0.13,0.13,0,1.15,6.49,3.69,2.8,0,2.29,0.13,0.13,1.65,0.13,0.25,0.76,0.13,0,0.13,0,0,0,0.13,0.13,0,0,0.64,0,0.13,0,0.38,0.25,0,2.93,10.18,0.25,1.65,7.25,0.51,0.25,0.13,4.33,4.83,2.8,0.38,0.13,0,0.13,0,0,14.25,5.6,3.94,0.25,0,1.15,3.31

S .- NATO Talks,English,Russia,"President Vladimir Putin on Thursday accused the West of lying to Russia on NATO's expansion but noted “positive” developments with Washington over Moscow's demands for security guarantees, with direct talks expected in Geneva next year. The West has for weeks accused Russia of massing troops near its border with Ukraine and planning an invasion against Kiev. Asked about whether a war against Ukraine was a realistic possibility, Putin replied that Russia was responding to threats from Kiev and that its actions regarding Ukraine “depend on our security,” not on how talks with the U.S. proceed. “We have to keep an eye on what is happening in Ukraine, and on when they might attack,” he told journalists at his annual end-of-year press conference. “One gets the impression that [Ukraine] is preparing a third military campaign and we’re being warned not to interfere and not defend [Russian-speaking residents in eastern Ukraine] or face new sanctions,” Putin said. “We must react and do something about it.” At the same time, Putin said that ongoing negotiations with the United States on Russia’s proposed security guarantees were “positive” and hinted at fresh direct talks in the new year. “U.S. partners told us that they are ready to begin this discussion, these talks, at the very start of next year in Geneva,” Putin said. Putin repeated his demand that “there must not be any eastward NATO expansion,” one of several points in a draft list of security guarantees that Russia is seeking from the U.S.-led military bloc. “We were fooled by five waves of NATO’s eastward expansion. We’re not threatening anyone, they came to us. You’re asking us for guarantees, but it’s you who needs to give us guarantees immediately.” Putin then slammed Ukraine's development in recent years, saying there is “complete poverty"" in the country. He called the 2014 Maidan Revolution a “bloody coup d’etat” and accused Ukrainian “extremists” of planning operations to retake Crimea and the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine. Putin also defended Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and support of pro-Moscow rebels in the Donbass, saying that inhabitants of both regions had always thought of themselves as Russians. He stressed that Donbass residents alone should determine the region's future, adding that Russia was ready to act as a mediator to ""create a better future for the people living there.”",1,388,83.21,68.64,34.87,6.73,24.25,26.8,85.31,61.86,47.42,10.57,5.67,0,2.58,0.52,1.29,1.03,4.9,12.37,6.19,1.55,15.98,6.19,3.09,4.9,1.29,14.95,5.15,2.58,9.54,3.09,1.03,5.41,9.54,0.26,9.28,1.55,1.29,1.03,1.8,1.29,3.09,0,4.64,1.55,3.09,0.26,0,0.26,0.26,0,0,0.26,15.98,8.76,0.77,0.26,1.55,0.77,4.9,6.44,0,0,0,1.29,4.9,4.12,0.77,0,1.8,0,0.52,1.03,0.26,0,0.77,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.29,0,0.26,0.26,0.26,0,0,1.8,0.26,2.84,9.28,0.52,0.77,7.73,0.26,0,0,5.15,4.12,4.64,3.61,0,0,0,0,0,21.91,5.67,4.12,0,0,3.09,9.02

S ., Russia to Hold Security , Ukraine Talks Early January in Geneva",English,Russia,"The United States and Russia will hold much-anticipated talks in early January on European security and the Ukraine conflict after Moscow demanded NATO halt its eastward expansion. A spokesperson for the U.S. National Security Council told AFP late Monday that the talks with Russia will take place on Jan. 10. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov on Tuesday confirmed the date and said that the talks will take place in Geneva, where U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian leader Vladimir Putin met for their first summit in June. The Kremlin has grown increasingly insistent that the West and NATO are encroaching dangerously close to Russia's borders. Moscow earlier this month presented the West with sweeping security demands, saying NATO must not admit new members and seeking to bar the United States from establishing new bases in former Soviet republics. ""The United States looks forward to engaging with Russia,"" the National Security Council spokesperson said. ""When we sit down to talk, Russia can put its concerns on the table and we will put our concerns on the table with Russia's activities as well."" The Biden administration has insisted on taking action in lockstep with European allies. A US official said Tuesday that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered the USS Harry Truman carrier strike group to stay in the Mediterranean and hold off on sailing on to the Middle East. The purpose of the order was ""to reassure our allies and partners of our commitment to collective defence,"" the official said. Moscow and NATO representatives are also expected to meet on Jan. 12, while the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), which includes Russia and the United States, will address the tensions the following day. Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau of Poland, which takes the helm of the OSCE in the new year, will address the meeting, said a spokesperson for the organization founded during the Cold War as a forum involving Moscow and the West. The talks come after weeks of heightening tensions, with Washington accusing Russia of massing tens of thousands of troops around ex-Soviet Ukraine and plotting a winter invasion. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Moscow in the talks would take a ""hard line"" aimed at defending its interests and avoiding ""concessions."" At the United Nations, Russia's deputy envoy, Dmitry Polyanskiy, said the talks should be ""serious"" but also that Russia's draft agreements were not an ""ultimatum"" to the United States. ""I don't think that our colleagues will get away with some blah blah blah thing,"" he told reporters. ""It's a constructive proposal, but it's the proposal that works for everybody and that is in the interest of everybody,"" he said. Ukraine has been seeking to break from Moscow's sphere of influence and eventually join the NATO alliance. Russia already occupies a swath of its neighbor in the Crimean peninsula and is accused of fomenting a separatist pro-Moscow rebellion in the industrial east of the country. Deployment by Russia of tens of thousands of troops to the border sparked fears in Kiev and among its Western allies of a wider war, possibly including further seizures of Ukrainian territory. Putin denies planning to attack the neighboring country, saying the troop movements are to defend Russia against an encroaching Western military. The United States and its European partners have threatened to impose harsh economic sanctions if Russia invades Ukraine, while also offering to hold negotiations. The National Security Council spokesperson said Ukraine's interests would not be ignored in cutting any deal with Russia. Negotiations will include ""nothing about our allies and partners without our allies and partners, including Ukraine,"" the spokesperson said. ""President Biden's approach on Ukraine has been clear and consistent: unite the alliance behind two tracks — deterrence and diplomacy. We are unified as an alliance on the consequences Russia would face if it moves on Ukraine."" There was no immediate word on who would represent the two sides on Jan. 10. The meeting is part of the Strategic Security Dialogue initiative launched by Biden and Putin, which initially has focused on resuscitating post-Cold War nuclear arms control treaties.",1,682,94.13,69.91,23.15,11.31,22,30.06,82.4,57.48,43.7,5.87,2.2,0.15,1.47,0,0.29,0.15,3.67,14.37,9.82,1.17,14.66,5.57,2.2,5.87,0.88,12.76,5.28,1.91,9.97,4.84,1.03,4.25,5.57,0.59,4.99,0.44,0.73,1.03,0.59,0,2.2,0,3.81,1.47,2.35,0.59,0,0.59,0.15,0,0,0,14.81,9.09,1.76,0,0.88,0.29,4.99,6.89,0,0,0,0.29,6.6,5.28,1.17,0.15,3.37,0,0.44,2.79,0.15,0,0.59,0.29,0.29,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.15,0,0.88,0,0,0.44,0,1.61,0.29,3.08,10.26,0.88,1.32,7.33,0.29,0,0.59,3.96,3.96,3.96,1.91,0,0,0,0,0,14.52,5.13,3.52,0,0,1.47,4.4

European Union leaders, meeting in Brussels, insisted on ""the urgent need for Russia to de-escalate tensions caused by the military build-up along its border with Ukraine and aggressive rhetoric"". They reiterated a threat to impose ""massive consequences and severe cost"" on Moscow through sanctions, coordinated with the EU's partners in London and Washington. The U.S. has used similar language of ""massive"" retaliation in the event of a Russian invasion while attempting to reach out to Moscow to defuse the situation. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg branded Russia the ""aggressor"". Russian President Vladimir Putin wants direct dialogue with U.S. counterpart Joe Biden to resolve the stand-off, and is seeking security guarantees to stand down his troops. But the European leaders in their summit pushed for a return to the ""Normandy format"", a four-way dialogue between Paris, Berlin, Kiev and Moscow. On Wednesday, Russia handed a list of security demands to US Assistant Secretary of State Karen Donfried, who then came to NATO headquarters in Brussels to discuss them with Stoltenberg. The NATO chief also met Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and gave a joint news conference to insist that any decision on membership was a matter for Kiev and the alliance's 30 member states. ""We will not compromise on the right of Ukraine to choose its own path. We will not compromise on the right for NATO to protect and defend all NATO allies,"" Stoltenberg said. He said there would also be no compromising on NATO's partnership with Ukraine, describing it as important for both sides and ""not in any way a threat to Russia"". On Wednesday, Zelenskiy attended a prior summit with EU leaders — most of whose countries are also NATO members — and said that most of them supported Ukraine's position in the conflict. But he is frustrated that European powers in particular have refused to take preventive action against Russia, preferring to threaten a response in the event of Russian action. ""Since 2014, since the start of the war, I believe that basically Russia pushed Ukraine into NATO,"" he said. ""Basically I believe that today Russia itself is paving the difficult path of Ukraine to NATO."" He complained that, in his view, some EU members did not seem to have understood the extent of Ukraine's peril and urged them to act swiftly. On Wednesday, Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told Donfried that NATO should halt its eastward expansion and withdraw a promise that Ukraine could become a candidate for membership. A U.S. statement said Donfied would stress ""we can make diplomatic progress on ending the conflict in the Donbas through implementation of the Minsk agreements in support of the Normandy Format"". Ukraine and its closest supporters in the West want to cancel the opening of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will carry Russian gas supplies to Germany, by-passing Ukraine. Germany's new leader, Chancellor Olaf Scholz, has been cautious on this point, and some of the leaders meeting in Brussels fear pre-emptive sanctions will provoke rather than deter Russia. Getting Russia back to the negotiating table will not be easy. ""Moscow does not want to return to the Normandy format and wants to negotiate with the United States,"" a senior European diplomat told AFP. The diplomatic track was established at a summit in Minsk in 2015 where Putin accepted that France and Germany should play the role of moderators in the talks between the two belligerents. ""The Americans support a return to this format, and talks are underway with Moscow, but nothing has been agreed yet,"" the European envoy said.",1,623,96.12,61.05,14.12,5.6,24.92,28.57,78.81,54.9,44.78,6.1,3.05,0.32,0.64,0,0.96,0.8,3.05,13.32,8.51,0.96,17.01,4.65,1.61,5.14,1.28,10.75,3.69,1.77,7.87,2.57,0.32,4.98,9.15,0.48,8.67,1.28,1.77,2.09,0.64,0.32,2.25,0,4.33,1.28,3.05,1.12,0,1.12,0.32,0.64,0,0,15.25,8.83,1.93,0.32,1.77,0,4.17,6.74,0,0,0,0.96,6.26,4.98,1.28,0,3.05,0.16,0,2.73,0.16,0,0.16,0.16,0,0.16,0,0,0,0,0,0.32,0.64,0.48,0,0,0,0,1.61,0,2.41,8.67,0.32,1.77,7.06,0.16,0,0.16,2.57,4.33,2.41,1.12,0,0,0,0,0,16.37,4.98,4.65,0,0,1.77,4.98

Moscow is striving to complete what it began in 2014 in Crimea: to alter in its favor the terms on which the Cold War ended. The campaign began on Nov. 18, when President Vladimir Putin, speaking at a meeting of senior Foreign Ministry officials, called for “serious long-term guarantees that ensure Russia’s security.” On Dec. 1, at a ceremony for newly arrived foreign ambassadors, Putin was more specific. “While engaging in dialogue with the United States and its allies, we will insist on the elaboration of concrete agreements that would rule out any further eastward expansion of NATO and the deployment of weapons systems posing a threat to us in close proximity to Russia’s territory. We suggest that substantive talks on this topic should be started. I would like to note in particular that we need precisely legal, juridical guarantees, because our Western colleagues have failed to deliver on verbal commitments they made.” It would appear that Moscow began to review its “strategic patience” in relations with the West and Ukraine after NATO decided to grant Ukraine the status of Enhanced Opportunities Partner in June 2020. There was talk in Kiev of attaining the status of Major Non-NATO Ally, which would remove virtually all restrictions on military cooperation with the Americans. This, combined with Western sanctions against Russia, a lack of progress on implementing the Minsk agreements aimed at ending the conflict in eastern Ukraine, and the immobilization of Russian tools for influencing Ukrainian politics, was seen in Moscow as an alarming sign of Ukraine’s move into the Western security orbit. Even if the Minsk agreements are implemented in the way that Moscow would like, that still won’t enable Russia to achieve its strategic goals of keeping Ukraine in its own orbit of influence. Reintegrating the pro-Russian breakaway Donbass region into Ukraine’s political system won’t give Russia a veto right on Ukrainian foreign or defense policy. Kiev will still be able to marginalize the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk republics, just as President Volodymyr Zelenskiy managed to do with the pro-Russian oligarch Viktor Medvedchuk, his political party, and TV channels. Implementing the Minsk agreements may destabilize Ukraine in the short term, but Kiev will adapt rapidly, and then, NATO’s route into Ukraine — if not Ukraine’s into NATO — will be open. Moscow’s fixation on the Minsk agreements has prevented it from solving other problems in its relationship with Ukraine, and left Russia’s relationship with the West hostage to Kiev’s maneuvering. Now Moscow is seeking a way out of the impasse by trying to reach an agreement directly with the West that NATO will conclusively cease its expansion, which would force Ukraine to hammer out its relationship with Russia on Russia’s terms. To do this, Moscow needed to create a lever of influence on Western leaders that would prevent them from dismissing Russian concerns. That lever was provided by Russia’s increased military presence around Ukraine this year. The West believes the Russian leadership is now capable of conducting a limited military campaign against Ukraine that would force Kiev to accept terms once and for all for ending the conflict that has been simmering in the country’s east for nearly eight years now. Moscow used this demonstration of military strength to enter into direct discussion with the United States on its agenda. Along with promises that Ukraine won’t join NATO, Russia also wants guarantees that no NATO military infrastructure or facilities will appear on Ukrainian territory, even if it does not formally join the alliance. Moscow has made its demands public and is insisting that talks should begin as soon as possible. Putin’s call for legally binding agreements that NATO will not expand any further east has reduced its maneuvering room. It’s hard to imagine the alliance’s partners agreeing to any such thing, especially in a legally binding form, which would, in the United States, need to be ratified by the Senate. In any case, Moscow’s unrealistic demands — and their public announcement, when such sensitive issues are better discussed in private — have prompted suspicion in the West that they are simply a cover operation, and that the tight deadline issued by Moscow for starting talks indicates an imminent decision on a military operation. Nor has Moscow proposed any concessions of its own in exchange for the military and political limitations it would like to impose on NATO countries and Ukraine — other than repeating an old initiative for a moratorium on deploying short- and medium-range missiles in Europe. Still, we can assume that the military threat on Ukraine’s borders will prompt discussion within NATO of ceasing its expansion, especially if U.S. President Joe Biden (and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron) personally bring up the issue. In the United States, the possibility has been discussed at the level of experts. The question is how to formulate such a decision in a way that would suit both sides and would not require the North Atlantic Treaty to be amended. So is there a realistic format for a political undertaking not to expand NATO to Russia’s borders? There are two possible options. The first is to include a corresponding point in the 2022 NATO summit declaration in Madrid stating that the alliance will not expand any further to the east, and that this political declaration annuls all previous statements. That would allow NATO to disavow the declaration from the Bucharest summit in 2008, which promised that Ukraine and Georgia “will become members of NATO,” while preserving the open door policy enshrined in its founding treaty. Russia itself has already suggested something along these lines. The second option is an analogous point in NATO’s new strategic concept, which is planned to be adopted at the Madrid summit, or a combination of both of these formats. This would not provide legally binding guarantees: NATO’s strategic concept and its summit declarations are political documents and may be reviewed. But such a declaration at the top level would allow Russia to be reasonably confident that the bloc’s expansion would come to a halt. The political pledge made to Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990 that NATO would not expand its military infrastructure onto the territory of the former East Germany has never been broken. That is better than an unspoken promise not to accept Ukraine into NATO for another ten years. Diplomacy is the art of the possible, and this scenario, unlike others, is possible. The reaction of the NATO leadership has so far been sharply negative, but Biden has not yet spoken on the issue. It’s true that in any case, he doesn’t have a big enough majority in the Senate right now to get any legal guarantees of non-expansion ratified there. This is why the Iran nuclear deal was formatted as a political commitment, rather than a treaty obligation. Not to mention that within NATO, all thirty member states would have to ratify treaty obligations. Still, this should be the focus. An agreement to stop expanding NATO up to Russia’s border, regardless of its format, would be pivotal. It would open up the prospect of a different kind of relationship for Russia with the West and with Ukraine (as well as Georgia), while costing the NATO countries nothing but a change in rhetoric. Stopping NATO’s expansion would make it possible for Moscow and Kiev to hold direct talks on a conclusive resolution to the conflict based on the real state of affairs. If the two sides manage to reach an understanding on stopping NATO’s expansion to the east, then it should be possible to reach agreements fairly quickly on other “red lines” regarding Ukraine and also arms control. As in the late 1960s, direct interaction between Moscow and Washington could give a political framework to a future détente, within which agreements would become possible on European security. Still, escalation remains likely, due to unrealistic requirements being made under artificially short deadlines, as well as not enough emphasis on diplomacy — and too much on the military aspect.

The Baltic Sea pipeline is set to double supplies of cheap natural gas from Russia to Germany, which the European Union's top economy says is needed to help it transition from coal and nuclear energy. But the 10-billion-euro ($12 billion) project has for years been dogged by delays and drawn fierce criticism from Germany's eastern EU allies like Poland and from the United States. Critics say the project will increase Europe's dependence on Russian gas and Ukraine has described it as a ""geopolitical weapon."" ""Any new military action cannot remain without severe consequences,"" the Green minister told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, a Sunday weekly, referring to a Russian troop deployment on the Ukraine border. He warned that ""nothing can be excluded"" if ""there is a new violation of the territorial integrity"" of Ukraine. The new German government threatened to block the pipeline from operating if Russia invades Ukraine. ""In the event of further escalation this gas pipeline could not come into service,"" Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said. Habeck said: ""From a geopolitical point of view, the pipeline is a mistake,"" adding: ""All the countries were against it except Germany and Austria."" He added: ""The pipeline has however been built. And the question of it being put into service remains open and must be decided according to European and German law."" German authorities are waiting for the pipeline's Swiss-based ""Nord Stream 2 AG"" operating company to submit documents to restart the certification process. The pipeline would then also have to be approved by the European Commission — a process not likely to be completed in the first half of next year.

After a 50 minute phone call — their second in just over three weeks — both presidents indicated support for further diplomacy on the tense standoff between Russia and Western-backed Ukraine. Putin was ""pleased"" overall with the talks, foreign policy adviser Yury Ushakov told reporters. A senior US official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the tone ""was serious and substantive."" But there was no disguising the depth of disagreement — or the dangerously high stakes on the fringes of eastern Europe — ahead of in-person negotiations between high-ranking Russian and U.S. officials on Jan. 10. Biden ""made clear that the United States and its allies and partners will respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine,"" Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement. Ushakov, referring to Washington's repeated threats of economic sanctions as a response to a Ukraine attack, said this would be ""a colossal mistake. We hope this will not happen."" Ushakov also said that Russia is looking for a concrete ""result"" in the January talks in Geneva, while the White House said it, too, wanted action — de-escalation by Russia's massive military presence on the Ukrainian border. ""President Biden reiterated that substantive progress in these dialogues can occur only in an environment of de-escalation rather than escalation,"" Psaki said. Washington and its European allies accuse Russia of threatening former Soviet territory Ukraine with a new invasion. Some 100,000 Russian troops are massed near the border of the country, where Putin already seized the Crimea region in 2014 and is accused of fomenting a pro-Russian separatist war which erupted that same year in the east. Moscow describes the troop presence as protection against expansion of NATO, although Ukraine has not been offered membership in the military alliance. Earlier this month, the Russians issued a sweeping set of demands, including guarantees that NATO not expand and a bar on new U.S. military bases in former territories of the Soviet Union. The United States rejects what it calls a bid by the Moscow to dictate independent countries' futures. In a readout after the call, the Kremlin stressed that Biden told Putin that U.S. offensive weapons would not be deployed in Ukraine. The White House, however, said Biden merely reaffirmed existing policy. ""President Biden made clear that the U.S. is continuing to provide defensive security assistance to Ukraine and is not introducing offensive strike weapons. This was not a new commitment,"" a U.S. official told AFP. And U.S. officials repeated warnings of blistering economic sanctions backed both by Washington and EU capitals if Russia does attack Ukraine further. Biden ""laid out two paths,"" a senior administration official said. ""One is a path of diplomacy... and the other path is more focused on deterrence, including serious costs."" The January talks will see Russian officials sitting down separately with negotiators representing the United States, NATO and the regional OSCE security forum, which also includes the United States. Russia's delegation will be led by Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, and the U.S. delegation by Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman. Ukraine, which wants to join NATO but has been told it is far from being ready to win acceptance, is eager not to be cut out of any wider deal. US officials have been at pains to insist that no decision will be taken behind the Ukrainians' backs and that while US troops would not be sent to defend the country against Russia, ongoing deliveries of weapons and other military assistance are set to expand if Moscow attacks.",1,613,91.02,30.96,39.4,7.18,21.89,30.83,82.06,56.28,43.23,5.22,1.31,0,0.82,0,0.16,0.16,3.92,14.03,8.65,1.31,13.21,6.36,1.96,5.55,1.63,12.4,6.69,2.45,9.79,2.61,0.49,6.85,9.79,0.33,9.46,0.33,1.14,1.63,1.14,0.33,4.89,0,5.06,1.79,3.26,0.98,0.33,0.65,0.16,0.33,0,0,12.72,8.81,1.31,0,1.96,0.65,5.06,4.08,0,0,0,0.16,8.65,7.01,1.47,0.16,3.43,0,0.49,2.45,0.49,0,0.33,0.33,0.33,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.49,0.49,0,0,0,0.33,1.47,0.33,2.12,11.09,0.98,0.65,8.65,0.82,0,0.33,3.92,5.87,3.43,1.79,0,0,0,0,0,16.97,7.18,4.57,0,0,0.82,4.4

Stoltenberg also stressed during a joint press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that NATO would not yield to Russia’s demands to prevent Ukraine’s efforts to join NATO and the bloc’s right to defend its allies. The U.S. and the European Union threatened “massive” sanctions against Moscow in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.

President Vladimir Putin said earlier Thursday that Russia “must react” to what he alleged are Ukrainian plans to attack the pro-Moscow territories in eastern Ukraine known as the Donbass. Putin’s claims follow weeks of Western warnings that Russia could invade Ukraine as early as January. The independent Meduza news website reported earlier this week that recruiters in Russia had started gathering groups of mercenaries for a ""combat mission"" in Donbass, but that the scope of their work was unknown. According to Reuters, recruited Russian mercenaries are undergoing special training for defensive and sabotage purposes in the Donbass. “They are gathering everybody with combat experience,” the news agency quoted one of the recruited mercenaries as saying. The fighters said they were unaware of Russian attack plans or preparations, Reuters reported. One of the unnamed mercenaries reportedly said he was planning to join fellow fighters on the Russian side of the border with Ukraine’s separatist-controlled Luhansk region. Separatist leaders said they were either unaware of or not involved in the latest recruitment drive, Reuters reported. The Kremlin, which maintains that any Russian nationals on the ground are there voluntarily, denied official links with Russian private military contractors in eastern Ukraine. “It's the first we've heard of this and we don't know how reliable these assertions are,” Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying. The reports follow Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu’s claims that U.S. private military companies have stationed troops in eastern Ukraine for “provocations with unidentified chemical components.” At the same time, Russia and the United States have signaled readiness to launch talks over Moscow’s sweeping security demands as soon as early January. Faced with accusations of massing tens of thousands troops near Ukraine's border, Russia last week sent a draft list of its demands to the U.S., which among others includes a call to block Ukraine from future NATO membership.

Although any new Russian invasion could be devastating, they must prepare for the possibility. The Brezhnev-era Kremlin underestimated the West. In the late 1970s, the USSR began deploying SS-20 theater-range ballistic missiles aimed at Europe and Japan. Despite Moscow’s fierce campaign of propaganda, disinformation, and intimidation, NATO responded by deploying in Europe missiles of comparable range. Having failed to scare NATO into submission, hidebound Soviet leaders lost face. Then a liberalizing leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, came to power and agreed with President Ronald Reagan to ban both sides’ missiles. Soviet leaders in the “era of stagnation” may have believed their own false propaganda that the West was weak and disunited.  Today’s Kremlin may be making the same mistake. On December 17, Moscow publicized proposed demands which would in effect require the U.S. to withdraw from Europe and NATO to collapse. Only a day later, the Kremlin said it might “up the ante.” Nonetheless, on December 21 U.S. national security advisor Jake Sullivan said the U.S. was ready for talks in “full coordination with our European allies and partners.” In his December 23 press conference, Putin said he had “so far seen a positive reaction” to Moscow's proposals, but satellite photos show that in mid-December Russia was still deploying more tanks, short-range ballistic missiles, and other arms near Ukraine. Russia’s demands would force the U.S. to remove its nuclear weapons from Europe and forego deployment of theater-range missiles, even though such weapons could be deployed in European Russia. Proposed accords would ban NATO from admitting any “former Soviet republic” even though NATO has rejected such a ban. They would require that NATO withdraw infrastructure in its eastern members, but the heightened Russian threat to Ukraine may spur NATO to do the opposite. Evidently anxious about popular uprisings against its rule, the Kremlin also demands a ban on “actions aimed at changing the political or social order.” ""The Kremlin knows how to negotiate constructively, as it did successfully when it achieved the New START Treaty and the Iran nuclear agreement. On December 21, President Vladimir Putin hinted that the purpose of the new unrealistic demands was to help create a justification for war: “If our Western counterparts continue a clearly aggressive line, we will undertake proportionate military-technical countermeasures.” Thus, NATO might be wise to consider that Russia could launch a wider invasion of Ukraine. Wars always bring uncertainties, but several considerations could be relevant. First, any attempt to seize a large area east of the Dnipro River, including such cities as Karkhiv, Dnipro, and Odessa, and possibly Kyiv, would pose a major military operational challenge and take time. Looking at a notional scenario of an invasion by 130,000 Russian troops, RAND found that the operation would take “weeks, if not months, to fully develop and execute.” And an invasion could meet resistance and incur heavy casualties. Second, in 2014 Russian invaders faced a disorganized but determined Ukrainian opposition, but this time they would confront a better trained, armed, and motivated fighting force. Even a Russian “shock and awe” assault – mass cyber and electronic attacks, and a multi-front combined arms operation – might not easily carry the day. Ukraine’s defenses could be stressed but still slow invaders. Many Ukrainian commanders and soldiers are battle-hardened from the seven-year war in the Donbas. To reduce risks from drone attacks, some Ukrainian forces could disperse in small squads on ATVs or other mobile platforms. Equipped with precision-guided mortars, guided anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, and loitering munitions, mobile forces could frustrate some Russian battle plans. Third, if Ukraine were at risk of being overrun or if adjacent NATO allies were threatened, NATO might intervene. As in the 1973 Yom Kippur War when Israel was threatened with potential defeat, the U.S. could airlift military aid. Washington has not provided Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, which could down Russian helicopters and low-flying fixed wing aircraft, but in an extreme scenario it might do so. Although Biden says that providing U.S. troops is “not on the table,” in compelling circumstances NATO could unleash formidable air and naval power. Fourth, the Kremlin might be tempted think that fears of a widened war or of attacks by cyber weapons, long-range precision guided missiles, or even limited use of non-strategic nuclear forces would deter NATO from intervening militarily. These concerns might be a factor, but the Alliance has prepared to respond to aggression with its own tools of coercion. For example, it could mount cyber assaults that disrupt Russia’s economy and financial system and military logistics for its fighters in Ukraine. Fifth, Ukraine could mount a longer-term insurgency against Russian occupiers, which might be stretched thin or rely partly on ill-trained conscripts.  On December 19, The Washington Post said the Biden administration was exploring ways to aid guerillas. An insurgency might be sustainable if Ukraine west of the Dnipro River or if an adjacent NATO member state were to be a sanctuary and source of resupply. At the same time, Russian reactions to armed resistance could be “swift, direct, and brutal.” The Kremlin may err if it thinks Ukraine or NATO would easily submit to aggression. The hour is late, but Kremlin leaders might consider instead seeking a stable European security architecture that protects Russia’s interests while also allowing for a vibrant and sovereign Ukraine.

Mercenaries Preparing Donbass  Provocation  Russian Defense Chief,English,Russia,"Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu claimed on Tuesday that U.S. private military companies have stationed troops in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine and are preparing a “provocation using unknown chemical components.” Shoigu’s statements came during a Defense Ministry meeting in Moscow amid growing fears that Russia could launch an invasion of Ukraine. “We have identified the presence of over 120 members of U.S. mercenary groups in the cities of Avdiivka and Krasny Liman to commit provocations…Tanks filled with unidentified chemical components were delivered to the cities of Avdeevka and Krasny Liman to commit provocations,” the state-run TASS news agency quoted Shoigu as saying. Shoigu, considered a trusted ally of Vladimir Putin, also slammed the U.S. for increased tensions near Russia’s border. “The United States is building up its military presence at Russian borders. In the countries of Eastern Europe, American units with a total number of about 8,000 servicemen are deployed on a rotational basis,” he said. Shoigu further boasted of Russia’s improved military, saying that the country’s army was a “world leader” in terms of its modernity. Around 100,000 Russian troops are currently believed to be stationed on the border with Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied plotting an invasion into Ukraine, saying it is in its right to move troops within its borders. Speaking at the same meeting Tuesday, Putin warned of a “military-technical” response to what Russia perceives as threatening moves from the West.",1,238,98.93,64.86,55.68,8.48,23.8,33.61,77.31,50.42,39.5,4.62,0.84,0,0.42,0,0.42,0,3.78,11.76,8.82,1.26,18.91,5.04,1.68,2.52,0,11.76,4.2,1.26,8.82,2.94,0.42,5.46,4.62,0,4.62,2.1,1.26,0.42,0.42,0,0.42,0,2.94,0.84,2.1,0.42,0,0.42,0.42,0,0,0,10.5,5.88,0.42,0,0.42,0,4.2,4.2,0,0.42,0,0.42,5.88,4.2,1.68,0,2.52,0,0,2.52,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.42,0,0.42,0,0,0.84,0,1.26,15.97,0.42,2.52,12.18,0,0,0.42,2.52,3.78,2.94,0.42,0,0,0,0,0,18.07,7.14,4.2,0,0,1.68,5.04

The call comes after Moscow earlier this month presented Western capitals with sweeping security demands, saying NATO must not admit new members and seeking to bar the United States from opening new bases in ex-Soviet countries. The call, which will begin at 20:30 GMT, also comes ahead of talks between representatives of the two rivals in Geneva in January, with Washington saying it expects to discuss the Ukraine conflict and Moscow insisting its security demands be contended with. Biden, who is at his home in Delaware for the New Year's holiday, will stress in his call with Putin that Washington is looking for a ""diplomatic path"" out of the crisis, a senior administration official told reporters. ""But we are also prepared to respond if Russia advances with a further invasion of Ukraine,"" Biden will tell Putin, the official said, adding that Washington remained ""gravely concerned"" about the military build-up and wanted to see the Russian forces return ""to their regular training areas."" In a holiday message to Biden hours before the call, Putin said he is ""convinced"" that ""we can move forward and establish an effective Russian-American dialogue based on mutual respect and consideration of each other's national interests."" His spokesman Dmitry Peskov then told reporters that Moscow is ""in the mood for a conversation."" ""We believe that only through talks is it possible to solve all the immediate problems that we have in abundance between us,"" Peskov said, adding that the call was Putin's initiative. The call will be the second in less than a month between the two leaders, with Biden in early December warning Putin of ""severe consequences"" if Russian troops invaded Ukraine. Washington has led the charge in raising the alarm over Russian troop movements near its ex-Soviet neighbor Ukraine, where the West says Moscow has massed around 100,000 forces ahead of a possible winter invasion. Putin has denied the allegation and accused the West of stoking tensions, saying that NATO's eastward expansion is a threat to Russian security. Ukraine, which has since 2014 fought a pro-Russia insurgency in its east that has claimed over 13,000 lives, has repeatedly said it wants to join the U.S.-led security alliance. But Russia considers ex-Soviet states to be within its sphere of influence, and has grown increasingly insistent that the only way out of the crisis is the West accepting its demands that would redraw Europe's security architecture. At the talks in Geneva next month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has vowed that Moscow will take a ""hard line"" aimed at avoiding concessions. His ministry on Thursday said that delegations for the talks will be led by Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman. The United States has called some of the Russian positions non-starters, but said it is willing to talk and will also bring up its own concerns. Ahead of the U.S.-Russia talks, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke by telephone on Wednesday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. ""I was assured of full U.S. support for Ukraine in countering Russian aggression,"" Zelenskiy tweeted afterward. Blinken also spoke separately to his counterparts from Britain, France and Germany on ""coordination to deter any further Russian aggression against Ukraine"", State Department spokesman Ned Price said. The Biden administration has vowed to take all actions in lockstep with its European allies. Following the Geneva talks, Russian delegates will meet with delegates of the NATO alliance ahead of a meeting of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, a key Cold War forum that brings together Moscow and the West. ""We will determine further steps depending on the readiness of the United States and NATO for substantive talks regarding our concerns,"" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters on Thursday.",1,661,95,66.71,35.25,15.18,30.05,30.56,83.06,58.7,42.51,6.96,2.72,0.15,1.06,0,1.06,0.3,4.24,14.07,8.02,1.21,15.89,5.75,1.66,4.24,0.15,15.13,5.9,2.72,8.02,2.42,1.06,4.69,7.56,0.61,6.96,1.51,1.66,0.91,0.91,0.15,1.66,0,4.39,1.82,2.27,0.76,0,0.45,0.15,0.3,0,0,15.58,11.04,0.76,0.45,1.36,0.15,7.26,5.45,0,0,0.15,1.36,6.96,4.54,2.12,0.3,3.93,0.3,0.45,3.03,0.15,0,0.15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.61,0.3,0.45,0,0.3,0,0,1.82,0.45,2.72,11.2,0.91,1.21,8.62,0.61,0,0.61,4.84,4.08,5.14,2.72,0.15,0.15,0,0,0,16.04,5.14,4.54,0,0,0.76,5.6

",English,Russia,"One of the most asked questions in recent weeks has been whether Russia will attack Ukraine, despite a slight lessening of tensions in the wake of last week’s video call between the Russian and U.S. presidents. But how would ordinary Russians respond to a war with neighboring Ukraine? Our 2015 research — “Do Russians Want War?” — showed that there is little enthusiasm for a “real,” large-scale war among members of Russia’s modern, urban society (the country’s military operations in Syria and eastern Ukraine in recent years were not seen as real wars). The military action in Donbas in 2014, which took place against the backdrop of the triumphal seizure of Crimea, was viewed very positively by the Russian public. As soon as it became clear that Donbas was a different form of operation to Crimea, however (far bloodier and more destructive), public opinion went on the defensive: “Russia has nothing to do with it, the United States and Ukraine are to blame for all the loss of life, and there’s no real war under way in any case.” A very similar sentiment dominates today: a recent survey showed that 50 percent of respondents blame the United States and NATO for the worsening situation in Ukraine (16 percent blame Ukraine itself). Only 4 percent consider Russia to be responsible for escalating tensions. For a few years, the unprecedented patriotic surge of 2014 served as symbolic compensation for the socioeconomic problems that had already begun. Russians lapped up the real and imaginary threats that were fed to them, and generally assessed military action as justified, defensive, and/or preventative. These wars took place in the background: TV reports did not dwell on the brutal and bloody reality of armed conflict. At the same time, the militarization of official rhetoric and the growing authority of the army — which overtook the presidency in a list of most trusted institutions in 2020 — strengthened the so-called “Crimea consensus.” The sociological parameters began to change in 2018, however, with the dissipation of the rallying-around-the-flag effect. If in 2014 26 percent of respondents said that “Russia was surrounded by enemies on all sides,” then that opinion was shared by just 16 percent in 2020. The number of Russians who believed it was futile to look for enemies because “the root of the evil was Russia’s own mistakes” rose from 17 percent to 25 percent in the same period. The Crimea consensus and the symbolic might of state institutions remained, but they lost their power to mobilize. War started to frighten people. The average Russian is tired of self-deception and of persuading themselves that if a war does happen, it will not impact their lives or those of family members. Russian conformists are, of course, traditionally bellicose people, but theirs is the bellicosity of propaganda television talk shows, or the language of online hate. No conformists want a large-scale war: conscription is not part of the social contract, particularly at a time of accelerating inflation and economic stagnation. State propaganda has overused its powers of mobilization. Instead of mobilization, it has created a fear of world war. At the end of 2018, 56 percent of respondents to a Levada Center survey said there was a significant military threat from other countries. This year, the fear of a world war has increased dramatically, reaching a solid second place in a Levada Center list of the top issues causing Russians to worry. The other fears that have risen in parallel with that of war are those of an increasingly harsh political regime, mass repression, and arbitrary rule: the authoritarianization of the Russian political regime has not gone unnoticed. It’s symptomatic that the worsening of the public mood has gone hand in hand with a fall or stagnation in the approval ratings of the president and the authorities overall. The year 2018 was a pivotal moment in this process. To a large extent, it was the move to raise the retirement age that destroyed the classic Putin-era social contract: “you provide for us and leave our Soviet-style social handouts alone, and we’ll vote for you and take no interest in your stealing and bribe-taking.” A high level of support for Putin in the 2018 presidential elections was mistakenly interpreted by the authorities as real political credit, rather than indifference and mostly symbolic trust. The pandemic has only confirmed this bifurcation in attitudes toward the authorities: we support the symbols — the flag, the national anthem, and Putin as a representation of our geopolitical might — but we don’t trust specific initiatives and the actions of government at various political levels. This sort of mute dissatisfaction was visible during the 2021 parliamentary elections, when people voted for the Communist Party as an abstract alternative to the current authorities. There is one final aspect to this problem. When people talk about a war, they mostly mean a conflict with Ukraine (even if it would involve NATO, the United States, and the West). Of course, if war breaks out, state propaganda will convince most Russians that it’s necessary, and that we are, in fact, “liberating” our Ukrainian brethren from an alien government (even if Ukrainians chose that government themselves in free elections). This will all take place despite the fact that in 2021, 23 percent of Russians believed Russia and Ukraine should be friendly neighbors but still have their own borders: only 17 percent of respondents supported a unification of the two states. War is the business of young people and conscripts. But 66 percent of Russians aged between 18 and 24 have a positive or very positive attitude toward Ukraine. That’s despite a backdrop of unceasing vitriol directed toward Ukraine on state television, and the persistent, oft-repeated idea that it is external attacks that require Russia to take defensive measures. To put it simply, before launching an offensive, it’s worth thinking about who will fight in that offensive and how willingly, and to what extent an active conflict will prompt people to rally around Putin. The evidence suggests that even in the best-case scenario, the mobilization effect will be nonexistent.

A district court in Russia’s Rostov region located on the Ukrainian border disclosed that a convicted senior manager was in charge of buying, stocking and selling food to Russian troops stationed in eastern Ukraine. “This food was intended to be sent to military units of the Russian Armed Forces stationed on the territory of the DNR and LNR,” the court said in its verdict. The ruling was no longer visible on the court's website as of Thursday afternoon. Moscow denies the presence of Russian Armed Forces soldiers in the Donbass, the rebel-held region which has been locked in a protracted war with Ukrainian forces since 2014. It has maintained that any Russian nationals fighting in the conflict-torn region were there on a voluntary basis and not in any official capacity. Western countries accuse Russia of providing troops, equipment and funding to the separatists and have sanctioned Moscow over its role in the conflict. The Kremlin on Thursday called the November verdict's information on Russian troops a “mistake,” reiterating the official line that Russian troops are not stationed in eastern Ukraine. DNR and LNR refer to the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk “people’s republics” in eastern Ukraine. The U.S. RFE/RL news organization estimated that the bi-weekly supplies of 1,300 tons of products mentioned in the court documents would feed around 26,000 Russian troops. The defendant, identified as V.N. Zabaluev, deputy regional manager for military nutrition of the local company “Tekhnologiya,” admitted to have bribed officials up to four times in 2019. RFE/RL’s Russian bureau Svoboda reported, citing the verdict, that there may be other companies engaged in supplying Russian troops in eastern Ukraine with food. The court sentenced Zabaluev to five years in prison on charges of transferring 990,000 rubles ($13,500) from his boss to a military epidemiological official to gain favor with the authorities and avoid disruptions in the supply chain.",1,331,99,49.04,43.51,5.38,23.64,34.14,78.25,48.94,41.09,3.32,0.3,0,0,0,0.3,0,3.02,14.8,10.27,2.42,17.22,4.83,0.91,3.32,0.91,7.25,4.23,1.81,9.67,2.11,0.3,7.25,7.25,0.3,6.95,1.51,1.21,0.6,1.51,0,1.81,0,2.42,0.3,2.11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.46,3.93,0.3,0,0.91,0.6,1.51,4.23,0,0,0,0.3,7.25,3.02,3.93,0.3,5.44,0,0,3.93,1.51,0,1.51,0.3,0,0.3,0,0,0,1.51,0,0,0,0.6,0,0,0,0.3,0.3,0,1.21,13.29,0,0,12.69,0.6,0,0,2.11,2.72,1.21,0.6,0,0,0,0,0,16.62,5.14,4.23,0,0,1.81,5.44

Weeks of Russian military buildup near the Ukrainian border have raised alarm in the West that Russia might invade Ukraine as early as January. Moscow, meanwhile, blames NATO for provocations and threatening its security. Russia has repeatedly said it wants a legally binding guarantee that Ukraine will never join NATO and that the alliance will halt its expansion toward Russian borders. In the list of demands published on the Russian Foreign Ministry website on Friday, Moscow asks NATO to abandon all military activities not just in Ukraine, but also Eastern Europe, the Caucasus region and Central Asia. Russia also asks the U.S. not to establish any new military bases on the territory of former Soviet states and for NATO to guarantee that it will block future membership for any former Soviet republic. Russia demands that NATO pledge not to deploy troops to Eastern Europe without Russian consent, with the alliance prohibited from increasing troop numbers past those of 1997, before NATO expanded into Eastern Europe. The proposal would de facto ban NATO from deploying forces in former-communist member states including Poland, the Czech Republic and the Baltics. Another point seeks to reaffirm that Moscow and the U.S.-led alliance “do not consider each other adversaries” and that the two will “resolve all disputes peacefully and refrain from the use of force.” Russia’s Foreign Ministry handed the list to visiting U.S. diplomat Karen Donfried this week and President Vladimir Putin reiterated his demand that talks between the U.S.and NATO on international legal guarantees for Russia’s security begin “immediately.” Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told journalists in Moscow on Friday that Russia was ""ready"" as early as Saturday to begin security talks with the U.S. He also said Moscow was “extremely disappointed” by signals coming from the West regarding Russia’s proposals on security guarantees. Meanwhile, the U.S. said it wouldn’t negotiate without input from Europe. ""We've managed to engage Russia over strategic concerns for decades,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said. ""There's no reason we can't do that moving forward to reduce instability, but we're going to do that in partnership and coordination with our European allies and partners.” A senior official on Friday told reporters that the United States was willing to discuss security proposals put forward by Russia but disagreed with parts of them. ""We are prepared to discuss them. That said, there are some things in this document that the Russians know will be unacceptable,"" the official told reporters on condition of anonymity. The EU on Thursday rejected Russia’s bid to block Kiev’s NATO ambitions and repeated that it will impose ""massive consequences and severe costs"" on Russia if the country decides to invade Ukraine. Earlier this week, Ryabkov warned that Russia will respond “militarily”  if the Western military bloc does not guarantee an end to its eastward expansion. The sweeping demands will have great consequences for the balance of power on the European continent and experts said the West was unlikely to accept the terms presented by Russia. “The demands from Moscow appear to make any negotiation much more difficult. Seeking limits on NATO deployments and exercises on the territory of NATO member states is likely to be a non-starter in Washington,” Matthew Rojansky, director of the Wilson Center's Kennan Institute in Washington, told The Moscow Times. “The Kremlin cannot have a realistic expectation it will get legally binding commitments of this nature from NATO, but that may not be the point — rather it may be to shape negotiations in the shadow of a looming military threat to Ukraine and, by extension, to Europe,” Rojansky added. Rojansky pointed out that the message from the West to Russia has also been clear, that any further “aggression against Ukraine or any other state will not be tolerated, and will be met with an unprecedented response.” “In sum, these will be difficult but still vitally important negotiations.” Russia-based experts also doubted the West was likely to accept the latest demands. “Publication of Russian proposed agreements with U.S. and NATO on [European security] may suggest that Moscow (rightly) considers their acceptance by the West unlikely,” Dmitry Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, tweeted shortly after Russia published the demands. Trenin added that Russia “will have to assure its security single-handedly, most probably by military-technical means.” Andrei Kortunov, head of the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC), a Kremlin-aligned think tank, said that the Kremlin likely doesn't expect the West to accept its demands. “This is a bargaining position — [the Kremlin] is trying to get some degree of partial acceptance. Of course, there is a real risk to making these sorts of demands, especially if the West takes a harsh position, but clearly, the Kremlin thinks that the risk is justified in the circumstances,” Kortunov told The Moscow Times.

European gas prices rocketed Tuesday to all-time highs on strong winter demand and simmering geopolitical tensions between key supplier Russia and consumer nations. Europe's reference Dutch TTF gas price jumped nearly 20 percent from Monday to hit 175.00 euros per megawatt hour in early afternoon trading. ""Gazprom's actions are anti-competitive and have significant negative consequences for all European consumers,"" Yuriy Vitrenko, head of Ukraine's state energy company Naftogaz, said in a statement. ""Gazprom sharply reduced its delivery of natural gas to the European spot market, despite growing market demand,"" Vitrenko added. He also accused Gazprom of preventing other companies from supplying additional gas to Europe. Naftogaz said that Gazprom seeks to ""create an artificial deficit of gas to pressure the European Union into securing the rapid commissioning of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline."" The Ukrainian company said it filed a complaint with the European Commission against Gazprom ""abusing its dominant position on the European gas market."" The Nord Stream 2 pipeline via the Baltic Sea is set to double supplies of cheap natural gas from Russia to Germany, which the European Union's top economy says is needed to help it transition from coal and nuclear energy. But critics say Nord Stream 2 will increase Europe's dependence on Russian gas and Ukraine has described the pipeline, which bypasses its territory and deprives it of transit fees, as a ""geopolitical weapon"".

Shipments through the Yamal pipeline — which runs through Belarus and Poland to Germany — were at their lowest for at least a month over the weekend, Interfax reported, citing market data. Daily shipments fell from 27 million cubic meters (mcm) Friday to 5.2 mcm and 4.7 mcm on Saturday and Sunday, respectively. Gazprom also booked only minimal additional capacity on the transit route Monday — 3.8 mcm — worrying markets as gas prices rose across Europe once more. Gas prices climbed above $1,700 per thousand cubic meters on Monday — 70% higher than the levels seen in September when politicians across the continent first started worrying about a possible Russian squeeze on supplies ahead of the winter. The Yamal pipeline operates at a full capacity of 89 mcm per day, meaning flows were operating at only 4% of capacity Monday. Russia and Gazprom have previously been accused of trying to squeeze the European gas market to advance its Nord Stream 2 project and push European countries to sign long-term gas deals with Gazprom that guarantee supplies at fixed prices. The company increased supplies to Europe in the second half of November and early December, though prices have remained elevated given low storage levels in Europe, fears of conflict in Ukraine and new delays to Nord Stream 2’s certification. The Yamal pipeline is one of Gazprom’s major supply routes into the continent, in addition to the first Nord Stream pipeline and transit through Ukraine. Nord Stream is operating at full capacity and Russia has been reluctant to book additional capacity on the Ukrainian route in recent months. In auctions held Monday for January transit supply, Gazprom rejected an option to book extra supplies through Ukraine for a fourth consecutive month and booked only 22% of proposed extra supplies on the Yamal route, the state-run TASS news agency reported.",1,329,99,33.19,78.63,6.88,29.91,30.4,76.6,53.8,38.6,1.52,0.3,0,0,0,0,0.3,1.22,11.55,7.29,5.78,18.84,2.74,2.74,4.86,0,7.6,7.9,10.33,1.82,0,0.91,0.91,4.26,0,4.26,0.3,0,0.3,0.61,0.3,1.52,0,2.13,0.3,1.82,0.91,0,0.91,0.91,0,0,0,2.13,1.52,0,0,0.91,0.3,0.3,0.3,0,0,0,0,1.52,0.3,1.22,0,9.42,0.61,0,6.08,2.74,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.22,0,0,0.3,0,1.22,12.16,0,1.52,10.33,0.3,0,0.61,9.12,3.34,1.52,0.91,0,0,0,0,0,11.55,4.26,3.34,0,0,0.91,3.04

The defense ministry said in a statement that the drills for Southern Military District forces had taken place in a host of southern regions including Rostov, Krasnodar and Crimea, which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014. But the drills also took place further afield, including in Stavropol, Astrakhan, North Caucasus republics and even in Russia's Caucasus ally Armenia. The defense ministry said the troops were returning to their permanent bases and that stand-by units would be readied for the New Year's holidays. Western countries have accused Russia of massing upwards of 100,000 troops near Ukraine ahead of a possible winter invasion. According to Kiev's estimates, the number of Russian troops along Ukraine's borders has increased from around 93,000 troops in October to 104,000 now. Russia says it is free to move its forces on its territory how it sees fit and denies that it is planning a large-scale attack. It has presented the West with sweeping security demands, saying NATO must not admit new members and seeking to bar the United States from establishing new bases in former Soviet republics. Tensions reached a boiling point on Wednesday when President Vladimir Putin said Russia would take ""appropriate retaliatory"" military steps in response to what he called the West's ""aggressive stance"". But he lowered the volume the next day, saying he had seen a ""positive"" reaction from the United States to Russia's security proposals and said talks would take place next month.

The West has for weeks raised alarm over Russian military buildup near Ukraine and fears of a Russian invasion of its ally. Moscow denies planning an invasion into Ukraine and accuses U.S.-led NATO of threatening its security by expanding its presence near Russian borders. “If our Western colleagues continue the obviously aggressive stance, we will take appropriate retaliatory military-technical measures and react harshly to unfriendly steps,” Putin said at a Defense Ministry board meeting, according to the state-run TASS news agency. He did not specify which “military-technical” measures would be taken. The Russian president stressed that Moscow “doesn't want armed conflicts or bloodshed” and that it “has every right” to take what he views as steps that ensure the country’s security and sovereignty. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, meanwhile, said the U.S. has “expressed readiness” to launch dialogue with Russia on its proposed security guarantees that seek to limit NATO's eastward expansion. But Putin stressed that Moscow will only accept “long-term, legally binding guarantees” with Washington, accusing the U.S. of withdrawing from international treaties “that for one reason or another become uninteresting to them.” Russia last week sent the U.S. a list of sweeping demands that seek guarantees for NATO to abandon its military activities in Eastern Europe and Central Asia; to block future NATO membership for any post-Soviet country; and for the U.S. not to establish any new military bases on the territory of former Soviet states. The U.S. and European Union have issued repeated warnings to Russia that any military action in Ukraine would be met with sanctions far worse than those it levied in 2014, when Moscow annexed Crimea from Kiev and conflict broke out between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. Following Putin's comments, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance will “not compromise” on Ukraine's right to “choose its own path” and seek NATO membership. Also at Tuesday's Defense Ministry meeting, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu claimed that U.S. private military companies have stationed troops in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine and are preparing a “provocation using unknown chemical components.”",1,381,90.23,41.62,46.12,1,31.75,36.22,80.31,50.13,38.58,7.09,1.31,0,0.52,0,0.52,0.26,5.77,11.55,5.51,0.52,14.17,3.94,1.57,5.51,1.05,8.14,7.09,1.57,9.71,2.1,0.26,7.35,9.19,0.26,8.92,1.31,1.57,0.79,1.84,1.05,3.15,0,5.77,1.05,4.72,1.31,0,1.31,0.79,0.26,0,0,9.97,6.3,0.79,0,2.1,0.52,2.36,3.94,0,0.26,0,0.52,9.71,7.87,1.84,0,1.57,0,0.26,1.31,0,0,0.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.26,0,0.26,1.05,0,0,0.26,0,1.84,0,2.36,13.12,1.84,1.84,8.66,0.26,0,0.26,3.94,2.62,1.84,1.84,0.26,0.26,0,0,0,19.95,6.82,2.89,0,0,1.84,8.4

Four suspects are being tried in absentia for launching a BUK missile that hit flight MH17 over war-torn eastern Ukraine in 2014, killing all 298 people on board. Prosecutors launched closing arguments in the trial Monday, saying the four suspects played pivotal roles in securing the BUK system, which was most likely intended to strike a Ukrainian war plane. ""If this was the intention, that doesn't change the accusation of making it a criminal act,"" public prosecutor Thijs Berger told the judges. ""A mistake in target also makes no difference to the evidence that such a crime has been committed."" The suspects ""used a BUK missile as a tool to serve their own military interest and hit MH17 with it,"" he added. International investigators say the BUK missile was originally brought from a Russian military base, ostensibly to be used in the fight against Ukrainian forces. Berger said the men on trial ""did not press the button themselves, but... used it for their armed struggle with the aim of destroying an aircraft."" The four suspects on trial are Russian nationals Igor Girkin, Sergei Dubinsky and Oleg Pulatov, and Ukrainian citizen Leonid Kharchenko. All four have refused to appear in court in the Netherlands and are being tried in absentia. In three days of hearings this week, the prosecution are formally charging the four suspects and will set out their sentencing demands. A verdict at the high-security court, near Amsterdam's Schiphol airport where MH17 took off on its doomed flight to Kuala Lumpur, is not expected until late 2022 at the earliest. ""The maximum penalty is life imprisonment,"" a court spokesperson told AFP. The hearings come as fresh tensions soar over Ukraine, with the West accusing Moscow of planning an invasion. Girkin, 49, also known by his pseudonym ""Strelkov,"" is the most high-profile suspect — a former Russian spy and historical re-enactment fan who helped kickstart the war in Ukraine. Dubinsky, 57, who has also been linked with Russian intelligence, allegedly served as the separatists' military intelligence chief. Pulatov, 53, was an ex-Russian special forces soldier and one of Dubinsky's deputies. Kharchenko, 48, allegedly led a separatist unit in eastern Ukraine. Pulatov is the only suspect to be represented by lawyers. Prosecutors will spend Monday and Tuesday explaining evidence including telephone and electronic eavesdropping, the circumstances surrounding the missile, and the defendants themselves. The sentencing demand is expected to follow on Wednesday and will include an ""extensive justification of the requested penalty,"" the spokesperson said. Prosecutors said during the opening of the trial in March 2020 that if the court passed a sentence ""we will do everything in our power to ensure that it is enforced, whether in the Netherlands or elsewhere."" The trial heard harrowing testimony from relatives earlier this year, who spoke of the heartbreak of the loss of children, parents and siblings, and called on ""corrupt"" Russia to provide justice. Kiev has been battling a pro-Moscow insurgency in two breakaway regions bordering Russia since 2014, when the Kremlin annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula. Western nations imposed tough sanctions on Russia amid international outrage over the shooting down of flight MH17. Russia has recently massed troops near Ukraine's borders and the West has for weeks accused it of planning an invasion, warning Moscow of massive sanctions should it launch an attack.

Talks , Warning of  Military Response  to NATO Activity",English,Russia,"Russia demands immediate talks with the United States on security guarantees from NATO, a senior diplomat said Monday, while President Vladimir Putin’s chief arms control negotiator warned of a “military response” if the alliance continues to step on Moscow’s “sore spots.” Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov spoke days after Moscow made public a list of demands that seek to limit the U.S.-led Western military bloc’s role in Ukraine and the former Soviet space. “We need [answers] urgently since the situation is very serious and may get more complicated,” the state-run RIA Novosti news agency quoted Ryabkov as saying. Konstantin Gavrilov, who heads Russia’s delegation on military security and arms control talks in Vienna, echoed Ryabkov’s earlier warning of military action from Moscow in response to what it views as NATO’s threatening activities. “Everyone in NATO understands well that, despite all [its] strength and power, it needs to take concrete political actions,” Gavrilov said in a state television broadcast. “Otherwise the alternative is a military-technical and military response from Russia,” Gavrilov added without elaborating. Ryabkov, meanwhile, said he believes the West will “attempt to turn” Russia’s demands for negotiations “into a sluggish process.” The United States has responded to Russia’s demands for urgent talks by maintaining that it would not negotiate without input from Europe. The EU has rejected Russia’s bid to block Ukraine’s NATO ambitions. European officials have in recent days signaled a willingness to negotiate with Moscow, however. “We need to solve the current tensions on the diplomatic level,” the Financial Times quoted Germany’s new defense minister Christine Lambrecht as saying. “We will discuss Russia’s proposals . . . But it cannot be that Russia dictates to Nato partners their posture, and that is something that we will make very clear,” she said on a Sunday visit to German troops stationed in Lithuania — troops that Russia would like to see removed. “We will discuss these proposals that are currently on the table ... with all our partners in the EU and in NATO,” FT quoted German foreign ministry spokeswoman Andrea Sasse as saying. “It is important that in our dialogue that we have [with Russia] at the moment, we remain true to our own principles. And one of them is the indivisibility of the security of all NATO member states. And that has consequences for what we can and can’t accept.” In its list of demands published Friday, Russia demanded that the U.S. not establish any new military bases in ex-Soviet countries and that NATO guarantee to block these states' future memberships. Russia also wants NATO to abandon all military activities in Ukraine, Eastern Europe, the Caucasus region and Central Asia. Additionally, Russia wants NATO to pledge not to deploy troops in former-communist member states Poland, the Czech Republic and the Baltics without Moscow’s consent. Following Ryabkov's comments, the Kremlin announced that Putin will on Tuesday host an expanded Defense Ministry board meeting where it said the president will set out priorities for Russia’s Army and Navy. With the West watching Putin’s every move over fears of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, the military gathering will include the heads of each military branch, regional military districts, fleets and flotillas, as well as formations and military units. The top brass gathering will “evaluate the Russian Armed Forces’ activities in 2021 and set tasks and priorities for their further development next year,” the Kremlin said.",1,561,89.52,67.23,16.06,22.45,24.39,31.37,79.32,54.37,42.07,8.02,3.03,0,1.96,0,0.36,0.53,4.99,12.83,7.13,0.36,14.44,4.63,2.32,5.7,0.89,10.7,5.35,1.96,11.94,3.74,0.36,7.84,9.8,1.07,8.73,1.25,1.96,1.96,0.71,0.36,2.67,0,3.03,1.6,1.43,0.71,0.36,0.36,0.18,0,0,0,13.37,7.49,0.53,0.18,0.36,0,5.7,6.24,0,0,0.36,0.36,8.2,6.77,1.25,0.18,2.14,0.18,0,1.78,0.18,0,0.89,0.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.89,0.36,0.89,0,0,0.18,0,1.25,0,2.14,8.2,0.71,0.71,5.88,0.53,0.18,0.36,4.46,2.5,4.1,2.5,0,0,0,0,0,20.32,5.7,4.99,0,0,3.39,6.24

Barely a week after Annalena Baerbock was sworn in as Germany’s new foreign minister, she had to expel two Russian diplomats after a Berlin court found a Russian FSB agent guilty of a 2019 “murder by state contract” in the city’s central Tiergarten park. Meanwhile, many of new chancellor Olaf Scholz’s meetings in his first week in office were at least partly dedicated to Russia’s unprecedented amassing of troops at Ukraine’s borders, and to Europe’s reaction. It’s no surprise that Moscow is testing the mettle of the longtime German chancellor Angela Merkel’s successor — and the EU’s readiness to stand firm in its Eastern Neighborhood. The timing is perfect for the Russian leadership to relegate the EU to the back seat of talks on European security: a new coalition has just been formed in Berlin, French President Emmanuel Macron is up for reelection in the spring, and a direct bilateral U.S.-Russian channel was recently established for strategic stability talks. The Normandy format (France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine) suffered a serious blow last month when the Russian Foreign Ministry published confidential letters it had exchanged with German and French diplomats. Moscow is taking advantage of the situation and demanding to discuss European security directly with the United States as the only actor the Russian leadership takes seriously and feels equivalent to — knowing full well that Washington’s priority is China. The publication of a proposed U.S.-Russian treaty drafted by Moscow, including a number of unrealistic demands regarding European security, casts doubt on Russia’s seriousness about parleying, especially given the backdrop of the open military threat to Ukraine. Under these circumstances, Germany’s traditional approach of engagement with Moscow is becoming increasingly difficult to pursue, especially in a three-party coalition with diverging approaches to Russia. Despite Russia’s violations of the European security order, Germany has always been a supporter of continuous engagement with Moscow. Although then Russian president Dmitry Medvedev’s proposals for a new European security order from 2009 were met with skepticism, Merkel and her foreign policy advisor Christoph Heusgen devised the “Meseberg initiative” in response. When deterrence measures became necessary, Germany advocated for respecting existing agreements, such as the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act, and preferred to station rotating troops rather than permanent ones in eastern NATO member states. This approach often caused frustration among the Eastern Neighbors, whose warnings ahead of the 2008 war in Georgia, the annexation of Crimea in 2014, and the war in Donbas were perceived as unfounded prophecies of doom in Berlin—until the nightmarish wake-up call of 2014. Underestimating Russia’s willingness to act militarily is not a mistake Germany will make twice. But it now lacks the counterpart for the diplomatic engagement it had in the past, as Moscow is showing no willingness to engage in talks with Berlin on European security. At the same time, the new-old Russia policy of the so-called “traffic light coalition” of the Social Democratic Party, the Free Democratic Party, and the Green Party is still in the making and reflects the different approaches of the three parties. After intense discussions on the best approach to Russia (between the normative approach backed by the Greens and to some extent the Free Democrats, and the engagement-oriented approach backed by the Social Democrats), a language was found that is deemed satisfactory to all. While it is still sharper than the language of previous coalition agreements, some differences remain. The focus on human rights and the rejection of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline by the Green Party is difficult to square with the Social Democrats’ legacy of Willy Brandt’s Ostpolitik and support for the pipeline. Furthermore, the question of a credible security policy toward Russia remains on the table: Green Party leader Robert Habeck has been fiercely criticized for his support of defensive weapon deliveries to Ukraine. Although the Greens have moved toward the center in terms of security policy, skepticism of the traditional concept of deterrence remains, just as it does in the left wing of the Social Democrats. How to deal with the Nord Stream 2 pipeline in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine will be the litmus test for the new coalition to prove that its Russia policy is more than the sum of its parts. In the last two years, Moscow has managed to strengthen its position in the neighborhood, particularly in Belarus and in the South Caucasus, and to put the European gas market under significant pressure. Now, on the 30th anniversary of the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Russian leadership is trying to underpin and substantiate its claim for influence in Ukraine. Germany and its new coalition government will have to adapt Berlin’s traditional approach of engagement to provide a credible response to Russia’s military threats.

The tough sanctions would “halt Russia’s ability to import smartphones, key aircraft and automobile components, and materials from many other sectors,” according to Reuters. “They could have a major impact on Russian consumers, industrial operations, and employment,” the news agency cited the Biden administration official as saying. The reported export controls would mark a step beyond possible economic sanctions which the U.S. has already warned of.

""It comes as temperatures have continued to decline heading into the European winter, and we also got the news that [Russian energy giant] Gazprom had not booked any extra capacity in January for gas flowing through Ukraine."" ""That's an important story heading through the winter with implications for European growth, and one that will have investors closely following the weather forecasts to work out what might happen."" Europe's gas stocks had already been depleted by a prolonged winter last year. Added to the picture, calmer prevailing weather conditions have this year sharply reduced the supply of wind power. Some analysts blame the market spike on ongoing controversy surrounding Russia's planned Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. German Economic Affairs Minister Robert Habeck warned Saturday of ""severe consequences"" for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany if Moscow attacked Ukraine. The Baltic Sea pipeline is set to double supplies of cheap natural gas from Russia to Germany, which the European Union's top economy says is needed to help it transition from coal and nuclear energy. But the 10-billion-euro ($12 billion) project has for years been dogged by delays and drawn fierce criticism from both Germany's eastern EU allies like Poland and the United States. Critics say Nord Stream 2 will increase Europe's dependence on Russian gas and Ukraine has described it as a ""geopolitical weapon."" One third of Europe's total gas supplies come from Russia.",1,362,94.16,41.7,35.16,7.7,20.11,31.49,73.48,50.83,36.46,3.87,0.83,0,0.28,0.28,0,0.28,3.04,9.94,4.97,3.87,14.92,4.7,1.93,4.97,0.28,9.12,7.18,6.91,3.87,0.83,0.28,2.76,4.97,0,4.7,0.55,0.83,0.28,0.83,0,2.21,0,3.59,1.1,2.49,0.83,0.28,0.55,0.28,0.28,0,0,5.52,3.59,0.55,0,0.55,0.28,1.93,2.21,0,0,0,0,3.87,1.38,2.21,0.28,6.91,0,0,3.87,4.14,0,0.55,0.55,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.28,0,0.28,0.28,0.28,0,0,0.55,0,3.04,6.35,0.28,1.93,4.7,0.28,0,0.28,6.91,3.59,3.04,1.66,0.55,0.55,0.28,0,0,16.3,6.35,2.76,0,0,2.21,4.97

More than 1,200 Russian airborne and artillery troops, as well as chemical and biological forces and 250 pieces of military hardware, will conduct combat firing exercises at the Opuk training ground in Crimea, according to the state-run TASS news agency. “The servicemen will perform firing tasks and hit targets at various ranges,” the Defense Ministry was quoted as saying. The soldiers will also practice clearing mines and covering from air and drone attacks, it added. Russia’s military will also deploy Mi-35 helicopters for amphibious assault and to provide air cover for attacking troops. On Friday, paratroopers will perform close combat drills and artillery reconnaissance and attack maneuvers at the Raevsky training ground near the southern Russian city of Novorossiysk. The military classified the two-day exercises as part of an “operational assembly of the forces’ command personnel.” Russia announced the drills one day after the United States and Germany accused it of continuing to build up troops on the border with Ukraine. The West accuses Russia of massing tens of thousands of soldiers on the Ukrainian border to prepare for a possible invasion. The U.S. and its allies have warned of unprecedented sanctions if Russia follows through with the alleged plans.

The ill-fated flight heading for Kuala Lumpur took off from Amsterdam's Schipol airport in July 2014, and prosecutors this week launched closing arguments in the closely-watched trial. A verdict is not expected until late 2022 at the earliest. The four suspects on trial are Russian nationals Igor Girkin, Sergei Dubinsky and Oleg Pulatov, and Ukrainian citizen Leonid Kharchenko, accused of launching the BUK missile that hit the plane over war-torn eastern Ukraine. ""We are asking that the suspects Girkin, Dubinsky, Pulatov and Kharchenko, each for their responsibility of crashing a plane leading to the death and murder of 298 people, be sentenced to life in prison,"" prosecutor Manon Ridderbeks told the court Wednesday. All four have refused to appear in court in the Netherlands and are being tried in absentia. Prosecutors have argued this week that the four suspects played pivotal roles in securing the BUK system, which was most likely intended to strike a Ukrainian warplane. International investigators say the BUK missile was originally brought from a Russian military base, ostensibly to be used in the fight against Ukrainian forces. ""If we consider how much time the defendants put into planning and organising the deployment of the BUK, it is all the more poignant how little attention they appear to gave given to the risk of inadvertently shooting down a passenger aircraft,"" prosecutors argued, according to trial documents Wednesday. ""In legal terms, the defendants were civilians and were therefore not allowed to shoot at any aircraft, whether civilian or military."" The hearings come as fresh tensions soar over Ukraine, with the West accusing Moscow of planning an invasion. Kiev has been battling a pro-Moscow insurgency in two breakaway regions bordering Russia since 2014, when the Kremlin annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula. Russia has recently massed troops near Ukraine's borders and the West has for weeks accused it of planning an invasion, warning Moscow of massive sanctions should it launch an attack. Moscow denies the claims, with President Vladimir Putin seeking talks with U.S. counterpart Joe Biden and security guarantees to stand down his troops. Western nations imposed tough sanctions on Russia amid international outrage over the shooting down of flight MH17. The best known of the suspects, 49-year-old Girkin — nicknamed ""gunner"" — was one of the main separatist commanders at the start of the conflict with the Ukrainian army five years ago. He said Wednesday he was not surprised by the prosecutors' request, and denied the rebels shot down the plane. ""If they could have sentenced me to death, they would have done it, no doubt about it,"" he was quoted as saying by Russia's Interfax news agency. Dubinsky, 57, is said to be linked to Russian military intelligence, while Poulatov, 53, is a former member of the Russian special forces and Dubinsky's deputy. Khartchenko, 48, is believed to have led a separatist unit in eastern Ukraine. Prosecutors said during the opening of the trial in March 2020 that if the court passed a sentence ""we will do everything in our power to ensure that it is enforced, whether in the Netherlands or elsewhere."" The trial heard harrowing testimony from relatives earlier this year who spoke of the heartbreak of the loss of children, parents and siblings, and called on ""corrupt"" Russia to provide justice.",1,576,96.64,51.44,50.79,1,26.18,30.9,80.21,55.03,45.14,5.21,2.43,0.17,0.69,0,0.69,0.69,2.78,14.24,9.72,3.3,15.97,6.08,1.39,4.69,0.69,11.63,4.17,3.13,9.38,1.74,1.04,6.77,8.68,0.52,8.16,2.43,1.91,0.52,1.22,0.52,2.6,0,6.25,0.87,5.21,1.04,0,0.87,0,0.69,0.17,0,11.28,6.25,0,0.17,2.43,1.04,2.95,4.69,0.52,0,0,0.69,3.82,2.26,1.56,0,0.69,0.17,0,0.52,0,0,0.69,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.69,0,0,0.17,0.35,0,0,0,0.87,0.17,2.95,11.63,0.87,2.26,8.16,0.35,0.17,0.17,3.82,5.9,2.6,1.22,0,0,0,0,0,15.28,4.17,6.25,0,0,1.04,3.82

German authorities are waiting for the pipeline's Swiss-based ""Nord Stream 2 AG"" operating company to submit documents to restart the certification process, BNetzA president Jochen Homann told a press conference. The pipeline would then also have to be approved by the European Commission, he said, ""which means that decisions on this will not be made in the first half of the year"". Nord Stream 2 was completed in September but BNetzA suspended the German approval process in November, saying it needed to become compliant with German law before it could be certified.

Due to Covid-19 restrictions, media outlets were not able to apply for accreditation to the event for the first time since it was first held in 2001. Instead, the Kremlin hand-picked around 500 international and domestic journalists to participate. A number of critical independent outlets, including Novaya Gazeta — whose chief editor shared the Nobel Peace Prize this year — said they received no invite. In addition to the Ukraine crisis, journalists questioned Putin on topics ranging from Russia's crackdown on civil society and the coronavirus pandemic’s effect on the economy to his relationship with Russian Santa Claus in the nearly four-hour event. Here are the key topics he addressed: Several questions were dedicated to the situation with Ukraine, with Putin railing against Kiev and its Western allies for causing the recent surge in tensions and demanding that the West give Russia security guarantees “right now.” But he expressed optimism toward talks with Washington on Moscow’s series of proposed security guarantees that seek to shut NATO out of much of the post-Soviet world. He called the current negotiations with the U.S. “positive” and hinted at fresh direct talks in Geneva in the new year, saying: “The ball is in their court.” The West accuses Russia of plotting to invade Ukraine, which has been battling pro-Moscow separatists in its eastern Donbass region since 2014. Asked about the situation with Ukraine and whether a war was realistic, Putin replied that Russia was responding to threats from Kiev. He called the 2014 Maidan Revolution a “bloody coup d’etat” and accused Ukrainian “extremists” of planning operations to retake Crimea and the Donbass. “We must think about the prospects of our own security. We have to keep an eye on what is happening in Ukraine, and on when they might attack,” he says. Putin referred emotionally to the plight of Donbass’ inhabitants and stressed that the region’s residents alone should determine its future, adding that Russia was ready to act as a mediator to ""create a better future for the people living there.” Putin claimed that Ukraine “refuses to talk” to Donbass representatives and pointed a finger at Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who he said rose to power on promises to end the war and implement the Minsk Accords but had since “come under the influence of radical elements.” In response to a question about Moscow’s tensions with the West, Putin said his country’s actions will not depend on talks with the U.S. on his proposed security guarantees, but on the “unconditional provision of Russia's security.” He stressed that NATO’s expansion to the east was “unacceptable” and continued to slam the U.S., which he said “brazenly lied” about NATO’s “five waves of expansion.” “The U.S. is placing rockets at our doorstep... How would the U.S. react if we delivered rockets near their borders with Canada or Mexico?” he said. With the second year of the pandemic coming to a close and Russia’s excess death toll among the highest in the world, the coronavirus was a constant presence through the press conference. Putin bemoaned Russia’s low vaccination rate — currently at around 45% of adults after a year-long vaccination campaign — and blamed it for the country’s Covid-19 death rate, itself one of the world’s highest. Polls have shown that a consistent, though decreasing, majority of Russians are suspicious of the vaccine and do not plan to inoculate themselves. However, Putin reiterated his long-standing opposition to vaccine mandates, saying that those reluctant to vaccinate should be treated “respectfully” and have the issue “explained” to them. Nonetheless, the president singled out critics of vaccination, who he accused of using the issue to bolster their public profile and of being “dishonest.” Russia’s Communist Party opposition has been leveraging anti-vaccine and anti-lockdown sentiment into a modest increase in its own opinion polling in recent months. The first few questions of the press conference were dedicated to Russia’s economy, which has recovered to its pre-coronavirus state but has slowed in recent months. Putin said Russia had recovered better from the pandemic compared to many developed countries, listed off a number of economic statistics and said he expected real incomes — which are around 10% lower than they were in 2013 — to rise by 3.5% this year. But he listed growing inflation and the country’s demographic situation as major challenges facing the economy. Inflation is currently at a six-year high of 8.4% and he said Russian business figures complain to him every day about the high interest rates introduced by the Central Bank to tame price risis. However, he defended the Central Bank’s policy and its independence. “You can ‘scold’ the Central Bank for raising rates — as representatives of the real economy do, not on camera, but at meetings with me — but if you do not do this, it will be like in Turkey,” Putin said, referring to the Turkish lira’s extreme volatility in recent weeks after its Central Bank cut interest rates despite high inflation. The president also said Gazprom was not to blame for record gas prices in Europe and called on countries to sign long-term agreements with the Russian state-controlled gas company if it wants to ensure stable supplies at fixed prices. “With long-term contracts, prices are three, four, or even seven times cheaper,” Putin says. Europe has in recent years moved towards shorter-term agreements which give more flexibility, but require buying more gas at market prices. “I see these accusations that Gazprom has not booked extra capacity on the Yamal-Europe route. This is because buyers have not made any purchase orders.” Putin repeated his long-standing disdain of Western “liberal” values and defended so-called “traditional values” in response to a question from the state-run RT broadcaster on cancel culture and the controversy surrounding ""Harry Potter” author J.K. Rowling’s comments on transgender people. “I adhere to the traditional approach — a woman is a woman, a man is a man, a mother is a mother, a father is a father,” Putin said, adding that he hoped that Russians had enough defenses against gender-fluid ""obscurantism.” In his answer, Putin said cancel culture was ""like the coronavirus,” with new variants frequently appearing,” adding that following traditional values was Russia’s proposed “antidote.” Putin urged Western governments to “turn a page” on jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny’s poisoning and sought civil society’s help in investigating torture cases across Russian prisons. He claimed without evidence that Western countries have failed to provide proof of Navalny’s August 2020 poisoning with the Novichok nerve agent in Siberia. “Give us a reason to open a criminal case. But if there’s nothing to answer, let’s turn this page,” Putin said. “That Novichok or whatever it is — at least give us [samples],” Putin said. Putin hinted that Navalny serves “foreign interests” that he compared to figures who “destroyed” the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union “from the inside,” and accused the activist of using politics as a “shield” from his criminal conviction. Navalny returned to Russia in early 2021, where he was promptly sentenced to 2.5 years in prison for violating parole while in recovery abroad. When asked about Russia's labeling of independent media and NGOs as ""foreign agents"" this year, he said that such legislation originated in the U.S. in the 1930s and claimed that Russia's ""foreign agents"" law is more liberal than its Western equivalents. Putin also addressed the high-profile video leaks showing alleged rape and torture inside Russia’s prison system that drew nationwide attention this year. After claiming that prison torture also exists in the United States and France, Putin said Russian authorities have opened 17 criminal cases following the torture leaks. “It should be clear to everyone that punishment for these offenses is inevitable,” he said, adding that the investigations “should of course use the capabilities of civil society.” In addition to the host of reporters from domestic media, Putin took questions from British, Italian, Kazakh, Chinese and Belarusian outlets. In answers to the latter three, he stressed Russia’s strong, friendly economic and cultural relations with their respective countries. To an Italian reporter, Putin said that despite Italy’s membership in NATO and the EU, he hoped for ongoing cooperation with the country in various spheres. Meanwhile, he slammed a reporter from Britain’s Sky News for what he said was the West’s hostile foreign policy toward Russia. When asked about Russia’s relations with the new Taliban regime in Afghanistan, he did not say whether Russia would recognize the new government in Kabul, but said he hoped the situation in the country would be stable and warned against the penetration of extremists into the bordering Central Asian republics. He also called on the West to unfreeze Afghanistan’s financial assets, saying the country is on the brink of a widespread humanitarian crisis. Putin also discussed closer integration with Belarus and its embattled leader Alexander Lukashenko. Moscow and Minsk are working on a number of proposals to closer integrate the two countries, as Russia has become Belarus’ key financial and political supporter amid widespread international isolation of the Lukashenko regime over the past year. “We are building a ‘Union State,’” Putin said, but noted that the level of integration between Russia and Belarus was “at a much lower level than that in the European Union. It’s incomparable.” In an unexpected turn of events, Putin was asked about his relationship with Father Frost ⁠— the Russian version of Santa Claus. The question was asked by a journalist based in Veliky Ustyug ⁠— a town in northwest Russia that is home to the mythical figure. Putin thanked Father Frost for having helped him become president and urged the mythical figure to help carry out Moscow's plans. ""My relationship with Father Frost has always developed in a good way,"" Putin said. ""I am grateful to him that I can meet with you in my capacity…I can advocate for Father Frost and remind the plaintiff that Father Frost only fulfils the wishes of boys and girls who have been good.""",1,1680,92.5,53.57,27.48,8.55,25.45,28.45,82.32,60.24,45.89,8.21,4.35,0.48,0.54,0.18,2.32,0.54,3.87,13.93,8.45,1.73,16.19,5.3,2.5,5.54,0.65,11.61,6.85,3.63,5.71,1.96,0.71,3.04,9.64,0.3,9.35,1.96,1.31,0.95,1.43,0.54,3.63,0.06,5.18,1.9,3.15,1.31,0.48,0.71,0.24,0.12,0,0.06,14.52,7.44,0.77,0.12,1.25,0.77,3.69,6.37,0.54,0,0.3,2.98,3.93,2.68,1.25,0,3.21,0.06,0.12,1.9,1.49,0,1.61,1.13,1.01,0,0,0,0.06,0,0.12,0.42,0.3,0.36,0,0.18,0,0.06,0.6,0.12,3.33,9.52,0.36,0.83,7.98,0.36,0,0.18,3.21,4.88,3.04,1.37,0.12,0.12,0.06,0,0,18.87,5.06,4.17,0.06,0,2.44,7.14

NATO member Turkey has irritated Moscow by supplying combat drones to Ukraine that Russia fears could be used by Kiev in its conflict with separatists in two eastern regions. But Turkey has also upset Washington and NATO by acquiring an advanced missile defense system from Russia that resulted in sanctions from the United States. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu urged Moscow and the Western defense alliance to air their differences in direct negotiations proposed by NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg. Russia wants NATO to provide Moscow with a binding security guarantee and withdraw its forces to positions they held before a wave of eastward expansion that began after the Soviet Union's collapse. ""For any proposal to be accepted, it should be acceptable by both sides. Russia made some proposals. But maybe NATO seeks the same kind of guarantees from Russia. This is not a one-sided issue,"" Cavusoglu told reporters. ""If the requests are maximalist — I’m not saying that Russia is maximalist in any case — both sides must be constructive,"" he said. ""They should come to the table with proposals that both sides can accept."" A NATO spokesman said the Brussels-based alliance had been ""in touch"" with Moscow about holding a meeting of the NATO-Russia Council on Jan. 12. Russia has not yet formally accepted the offer. ""If Russia has any certain specific expectation or issue from Turkey regarding reducing tensions between Russia and NATO, Turkey will evaluate this positively because our objective is clear,"" said Cavusoglu.

Broadcaster RT — previously known as Russia Today — said on its website that YouTube had taken down its newly launched ""Auf Sendung"" (On Air) channel ""without explanation"". The 24/7 channel can still be viewed on other platforms, including on the RT DE website. A YouTube spokesperson told AFP that the channel was removed for trying to circumvent its earlier termination of RT's German channels RT DE and Der Fehlende Part. ""When a channel is terminated, the uploader is not allowed to use, own or create any other YouTube channels,"" the spokesperson said. ""As a result of this circumvention attempt, the new channel 'RT auf Sendung' was permanently removed for violating YouTube's terms of service."" Google-owned YouTube in September issued a warning to RT DE for violating its coronavirus disinformation guidelines and then shuttered two channels for breaching user terms. The move angered Moscow, which accused YouTube of ""censorship"" and said the ban was likely aided by German authorities at a time of strained diplomatic ties between the two countries. Berlin denied the claim and said it had ""nothing to do with"" YouTube's decision. The latest YouTube spat comes as tensions are running high between Russia and Germany, a day after a Berlin court sentenced a Russian to life in jail over a 2019 assassination on German soil it says was ordered by Moscow. The ruling prompted Germany to expel two Russian diplomats. Germany has also echoed Western alarm about Russia's troop movements on the border with Ukraine, with new chancellor Olaf Scholz warning on Wednesday that Russia would pay ""a high price"" for invading Ukraine. Launched in 2005 as ""Russia Today"", state-funded RT has expanded with broadcasters and websites in languages including English, French, Spanish and Arabic. It has generated controversy in many countries, including the United States, where it was required to register as a ""foreign agent"", and in Britain, where authorities have threatened to revoke its broadcasting licence.

Due to Covid-19 restrictions, media outlets were not able to apply for accreditation to the event for the first time since it was first held in 2001. Instead, the Kremlin hand-picked around 500 international and domestic journalists to participate. A number of critical independent outlets, including Novaya Gazeta — whose chief editor shared the Nobel Peace Prize this year — said they received no invite. In addition to the Ukraine crisis, journalists questioned Putin on topics ranging from Russia's crackdown on civil society and the coronavirus pandemic’s effect on the economy to his relationship with Russian Santa Claus in the nearly four-hour event. Here are the key topics he addressed: Several questions were dedicated to the situation with Ukraine, with Putin railing against Kiev and its Western allies for causing the recent surge in tensions and demanding that the West give Russia security guarantees “right now.” But he expressed optimism toward talks with Washington on Moscow’s series of proposed security guarantees that seek to shut NATO out of much of the post-Soviet world. He called the current negotiations with the U.S. “positive” and hinted at fresh direct talks in Geneva in the new year, saying: “The ball is in their court.” The West accuses Russia of plotting to invade Ukraine, which has been battling pro-Moscow separatists in its eastern Donbass region since 2014. Asked about the situation with Ukraine and whether a war was realistic, Putin replied that Russia was responding to threats from Kiev. He called the 2014 Maidan Revolution a “bloody coup d’etat” and accused Ukrainian “extremists” of planning operations to retake Crimea and the Donbass. “We must think about the prospects of our own security. We have to keep an eye on what is happening in Ukraine, and on when they might attack,” he says. Putin referred emotionally to the plight of Donbass’ inhabitants and stressed that the region’s residents alone should determine its future, adding that Russia was ready to act as a mediator to ""create a better future for the people living there.” Putin claimed that Ukraine “refuses to talk” to Donbass representatives and pointed a finger at Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who he said rose to power on promises to end the war and implement the Minsk Accords but had since “come under the influence of radical elements.” In response to a question about Moscow’s tensions with the West, Putin said his country’s actions will not depend on talks with the U.S. on his proposed security guarantees, but on the “unconditional provision of Russia's security.” He stressed that NATO’s expansion to the east was “unacceptable” and continued to slam the U.S., which he said “brazenly lied” about NATO’s “five waves of expansion.” “The U.S. is placing rockets at our doorstep... How would the U.S. react if we delivered rockets near their borders with Canada or Mexico?” he said. With the second year of the pandemic coming to a close and Russia’s excess death toll among the highest in the world, the coronavirus was a constant presence through the press conference. Putin bemoaned Russia’s low vaccination rate — currently at around 45% of adults after a year-long vaccination campaign — and blamed it for the country’s Covid-19 death rate, itself one of the world’s highest. Polls have shown that a consistent, though decreasing, majority of Russians are suspicious of the vaccine and do not plan to inoculate themselves. However, Putin reiterated his long-standing opposition to vaccine mandates, saying that those reluctant to vaccinate should be treated “respectfully” and have the issue “explained” to them. Nonetheless, the president singled out critics of vaccination, who he accused of using the issue to bolster their public profile and of being “dishonest.” Russia’s Communist Party opposition has been leveraging anti-vaccine and anti-lockdown sentiment into a modest increase in its own opinion polling in recent months. The first few questions of the press conference were dedicated to Russia’s economy, which has recovered to its pre-coronavirus state but has slowed in recent months. Putin said Russia had recovered better from the pandemic compared to many developed countries, listed off a number of economic statistics and said he expected real incomes — which are around 10% lower than they were in 2013 — to rise by 3.5% this year. But he listed growing inflation and the country’s demographic situation as major challenges facing the economy. Inflation is currently at a six-year high of 8.4% and he said Russian business figures complain to him every day about the high interest rates introduced by the Central Bank to tame price risis. However, he defended the Central Bank’s policy and its independence. “You can ‘scold’ the Central Bank for raising rates — as representatives of the real economy do, not on camera, but at meetings with me — but if you do not do this, it will be like in Turkey,” Putin said, referring to the Turkish lira’s extreme volatility in recent weeks after its Central Bank cut interest rates despite high inflation. The president also said Gazprom was not to blame for record gas prices in Europe and called on countries to sign long-term agreements with the Russian state-controlled gas company if it wants to ensure stable supplies at fixed prices. “With long-term contracts, prices are three, four, or even seven times cheaper,” Putin says. Europe has in recent years moved towards shorter-term agreements which give more flexibility, but require buying more gas at market prices. “I see these accusations that Gazprom has not booked extra capacity on the Yamal-Europe route. This is because buyers have not made any purchase orders.” Putin repeated his long-standing disdain of Western “liberal” values and defended so-called “traditional values” in response to a question from the state-run RT broadcaster on cancel culture and the controversy surrounding ""Harry Potter” author J.K. Rowling’s comments on transgender people. “I adhere to the traditional approach — a woman is a woman, a man is a man, a mother is a mother, a father is a father,” Putin said, adding that he hoped that Russians had enough defenses against gender-fluid ""obscurantism.” In his answer, Putin said cancel culture was ""like the coronavirus,” with new variants frequently appearing,” adding that following traditional values was Russia’s proposed “antidote.” Putin urged Western governments to “turn a page” on jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny’s poisoning and sought civil society’s help in investigating torture cases across Russian prisons. He claimed without evidence that Western countries have failed to provide proof of Navalny’s August 2020 poisoning with the Novichok nerve agent in Siberia. “Give us a reason to open a criminal case. But if there’s nothing to answer, let’s turn this page,” Putin said. “That Novichok or whatever it is — at least give us [samples],” Putin said. Putin hinted that Navalny serves “foreign interests” that he compared to figures who “destroyed” the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union “from the inside,” and accused the activist of using politics as a “shield” from his criminal conviction. Navalny returned to Russia in early 2021, where he was promptly sentenced to 2.5 years in prison for violating parole while in recovery abroad. When asked about Russia's labeling of independent media and NGOs as ""foreign agents"" this year, he said that such legislation originated in the U.S. in the 1930s and claimed that Russia's ""foreign agents"" law is more liberal than its Western equivalents. Putin also addressed the high-profile video leaks showing alleged rape and torture inside Russia’s prison system that drew nationwide attention this year. After claiming that prison torture also exists in the United States and France, Putin said Russian authorities have opened 17 criminal cases following the torture leaks. “It should be clear to everyone that punishment for these offenses is inevitable,” he said, adding that the investigations “should of course use the capabilities of civil society.” In addition to the host of reporters from domestic media, Putin took questions from British, Italian, Kazakh, Chinese and Belarusian outlets. In answers to the latter three, he stressed Russia’s strong, friendly economic and cultural relations with their respective countries. To an Italian reporter, Putin said that despite Italy’s membership in NATO and the EU, he hoped for ongoing cooperation with the country in various spheres. Meanwhile, he slammed a reporter from Britain’s Sky News for what he said was the West’s hostile foreign policy toward Russia. When asked about Russia’s relations with the new Taliban regime in Afghanistan, he did not say whether Russia would recognize the new government in Kabul, but said he hoped the situation in the country would be stable and warned against the penetration of extremists into the bordering Central Asian republics. He also called on the West to unfreeze Afghanistan’s financial assets, saying the country is on the brink of a widespread humanitarian crisis. Putin also discussed closer integration with Belarus and its embattled leader Alexander Lukashenko. Moscow and Minsk are working on a number of proposals to closer integrate the two countries, as Russia has become Belarus’ key financial and political supporter amid widespread international isolation of the Lukashenko regime over the past year. “We are building a ‘Union State,’” Putin said, but noted that the level of integration between Russia and Belarus was “at a much lower level than that in the European Union. It’s incomparable.” In an unexpected turn of events, Putin was asked about his relationship with Father Frost ⁠— the Russian version of Santa Claus. The question was asked by a journalist based in Veliky Ustyug ⁠— a town in northwest Russia that is home to the mythical figure. Putin thanked Father Frost for having helped him become president and urged the mythical figure to help carry out Moscow's plans. ""My relationship with Father Frost has always developed in a good way,"" Putin said. ""I am grateful to him that I can meet with you in my capacity…I can advocate for Father Frost and remind the plaintiff that Father Frost only fulfils the wishes of boys and girls who have been good.""",1,1680,92.5,53.57,27.48,8.55,25.45,28.45,82.32,60.24,45.89,8.21,4.35,0.48,0.54,0.18,2.32,0.54,3.87,13.93,8.45,1.73,16.19,5.3,2.5,5.54,0.65,11.61,6.85,3.63,5.71,1.96,0.71,3.04,9.64,0.3,9.35,1.96,1.31,0.95,1.43,0.54,3.63,0.06,5.18,1.9,3.15,1.31,0.48,0.71,0.24,0.12,0,0.06,14.52,7.44,0.77,0.12,1.25,0.77,3.69,6.37,0.54,0,0.3,2.98,3.93,2.68,1.25,0,3.21,0.06,0.12,1.9,1.49,0,1.61,1.13,1.01,0,0,0,0.06,0,0.12,0.42,0.3,0.36,0,0.18,0,0.06,0.6,0.12,3.33,9.52,0.36,0.83,7.98,0.36,0,0.18,3.21,4.88,3.04,1.37,0.12,0.12,0.06,0,0,18.87,5.06,4.17,0.06,0,2.44,7.14

The Roskomnadzor media regulator confirmed Saturday that it had blocked OVD-Info's website because the Moscow region court had ruled that the group's activities were aimed at promoting ""terrorism and extremism"" in Russia. Troops withdrawn Russia announced Saturday that more than 10,000 troops had finished month-long drills near Ukraine, amid Western accusations that Moscow was plotting an invasion of its ex-Soviet neighbor. The Defense Ministry said in a statement that the drills for Southern Military District forces had taken place in a host of southern regions including Rostov, Krasnodar and Crimea, the latter of which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014. NATO sit-down NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has sought a meeting of the NATO-Russia Council next month and contacted Moscow to secure its attendance, an alliance spokesman said Sunday. ""We are in touch with Russia"" about the Jan. 12 meeting, the first proposed by Stoltenberg since Moscow made its sweeping security demands, said the NATO spokesman, who asked not be identified. Russia’s Foreign Ministry said it was considering NATO’S proposal to meet on Jan. 12. Gas games Russian energy giant Gazprom has rejected accusations that Moscow is limiting gas deliveries to Europe via the Yamal-Europe pipeline and denounced Germany's resale of gas to Poland amid soaring prices. The pipeline was operating in reverse mode this week, public data showed, sending gas from Germany to Poland as European gas prices ticked up. Chechen crackdown Six Chechen opposition activists critical of regional head Ramzan Kadyrov’s leadership have reported dozens of their relatives being detained or kidnapped over the weekend. Committee Against Torture lawyer Abubakar Yangulbaev estimated on Instagram that at least 41 of his relatives were detained by unidentified men wearing black uniforms, with their passports and phones seized.

More Positively Despite Soaring Tensions – Poll,English,Russia,"Russians are more likely to have a positive view of the United States than view it negatively, according to a new independent survey published Thursday. Despite soaring geopolitical tensions, the Levada Center pollster's latest survey marks the first time in three years that Russians reported an overall favorable attitude toward the U.S. According to Levada, 45% of Russian respondents said they view the U.S. positively compared with 42% who view the U.S. negatively. Another 13% did not answer. “For the first time since July 2018, the share of respondents who view the U.S. positively exceeded the share of those who view it negatively,” Levada said. Russians’ attitudes toward the U.S. have improved significantly since spring 2021, when just 31% said they held a favorable view of the country. Levada also saw Russians growing more positive toward the European Union, with favorability growing from 38% in May to 48% in November. The EU’s unfavorable rating has also decreased from 45% to 38% over the same period. This change in attitudes comes amid heightened tensions between Moscow and Washington, with the U.S saying it fears Russia could be ramping up to invade Ukraine early next year. Russia denies planning an invasion and accuses U.S.-led NATO of threatening its security with eastward expansion and weapons deployment near its borders.

Weeks of Russian military buildup near the Ukrainian border have raised alarm in the West that Russia might invade Ukraine as early as January. Moscow, meanwhile, blames NATO for provocations and threatening its security. Russia has repeatedly said it wants a legally binding guarantee that Ukraine will never join NATO and that the alliance will halt its expansion toward Russian borders. In the list of demands published on the Russian Foreign Ministry website on Friday, Moscow asks NATO to abandon all military activities not just in Ukraine, but also Eastern Europe, the Caucasus region and Central Asia. Russia also asks the U.S. not to establish any new military bases on the territory of former Soviet states and for NATO to guarantee that it will block future membership for any former Soviet republic. Russia demands that NATO pledge not to deploy troops to Eastern Europe without Russian consent, with the alliance prohibited from increasing troop numbers past those of 1997, before NATO expanded into Eastern Europe. The proposal would de facto ban NATO from deploying forces in former-communist member states including Poland, the Czech Republic and the Baltics. Another point seeks to reaffirm that Moscow and the U.S.-led alliance “do not consider each other adversaries” and that the two will “resolve all disputes peacefully and refrain from the use of force.” Russia’s Foreign Ministry handed the list to visiting U.S. diplomat Karen Donfried this week and President Vladimir Putin reiterated his demand that talks between the U.S.and NATO on international legal guarantees for Russia’s security begin “immediately.” Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told journalists in Moscow on Friday that Russia was ""ready"" as early as Saturday to begin security talks with the U.S. He also said Moscow was “extremely disappointed” by signals coming from the West regarding Russia’s proposals on security guarantees. Meanwhile, the U.S. said it wouldn’t negotiate without input from Europe. ""We've managed to engage Russia over strategic concerns for decades,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said. ""There's no reason we can't do that moving forward to reduce instability, but we're going to do that in partnership and coordination with our European allies and partners.” A senior official on Friday told reporters that the United States was willing to discuss security proposals put forward by Russia but disagreed with parts of them. ""We are prepared to discuss them. That said, there are some things in this document that the Russians know will be unacceptable,"" the official told reporters on condition of anonymity. The EU on Thursday rejected Russia’s bid to block Kiev’s NATO ambitions and repeated that it will impose ""massive consequences and severe costs"" on Russia if the country decides to invade Ukraine. Earlier this week, Ryabkov warned that Russia will respond “militarily”  if the Western military bloc does not guarantee an end to its eastward expansion. The sweeping demands will have great consequences for the balance of power on the European continent and experts said the West was unlikely to accept the terms presented by Russia. “The demands from Moscow appear to make any negotiation much more difficult. Seeking limits on NATO deployments and exercises on the territory of NATO member states is likely to be a non-starter in Washington,” Matthew Rojansky, director of the Wilson Center's Kennan Institute in Washington, told The Moscow Times. “The Kremlin cannot have a realistic expectation it will get legally binding commitments of this nature from NATO, but that may not be the point — rather it may be to shape negotiations in the shadow of a looming military threat to Ukraine and, by extension, to Europe,” Rojansky added. Rojansky pointed out that the message from the West to Russia has also been clear, that any further “aggression against Ukraine or any other state will not be tolerated, and will be met with an unprecedented response.” “In sum, these will be difficult but still vitally important negotiations.” Russia-based experts also doubted the West was likely to accept the latest demands. “Publication of Russian proposed agreements with U.S. and NATO on [European security] may suggest that Moscow (rightly) considers their acceptance by the West unlikely,” Dmitry Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, tweeted shortly after Russia published the demands. Trenin added that Russia “will have to assure its security single-handedly, most probably by military-technical means.” Andrei Kortunov, head of the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC), a Kremlin-aligned think tank, said that the Kremlin likely doesn't expect the West to accept its demands. “This is a bargaining position — [the Kremlin] is trying to get some degree of partial acceptance. Of course, there is a real risk to making these sorts of demands, especially if the West takes a harsh position, but clearly, the Kremlin thinks that the risk is justified in the circumstances,” Kortunov told The Moscow Times.

The Kremlin chief, in power since 1999, also expressed support to Russians who lost relatives to Covid. His country is among the hardest-hit in the world by the pandemic. ""The insidious disease has claimed tens of thousands of lives,"" he said. ""I want to express my sincere support to everyone who has lost relatives, loved-ones, friends,"" he added.

""It has been agreed that at the very beginning of next year, the first round (of talks) should be bilateral contact between our negotiators and American ones,"" Lavrov said in an interview with Russian state-funded news network, RT. Lavrov said plans were in place for those talks to be followed by negotiations between Russia and NATO, saying ""we also want to do this in January."" On Wednesday the European Union appealed to the U.S. and NATO to defend its interests, saying in a statement: ""Today, Europe's security is under threat."" Later, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and EU High Representative Josep Borrell spoke to discuss Russia's proposals. ""They agreed that any discussion about European security will happen in coordination and with participation of the European Union,"" Brussels said in a statement. Lavrov had cautioned the United States against dragging out any negotiations and reiterated that although Russia did not want conflict it was prepared to take steps to defend itself. ""We hope that no one else views conflicts as a desirable scenario. We will toughly ensure our security by those means that we deem appropriate,"" Lavrov told a panel of RT journalists.

Became  Arrogant  After Fall of Soviet Union – Gorbachev,English,Russia,"Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev said Friday that Washington grew ""arrogant and self-confident"" after the collapse of the Soviet Union, leading to the expansion of the NATO military alliance. In recent years President Vladimir Putin has grown increasingly insistent that NATO is encroaching close to Russia's borders, and Moscow last week demanded ""legal guarantees"" that the U.S.-led alliance will halt its eastward expansion. ""How can one count on equal relations with the United States and the West in such a position?"" Gorbachev told state news agency RIA Novosti on the eve of the anniversary of his resignation as the leader of the U.S.S.R. He noted the ""triumphant mood in the West, especially in the United States"" after the Soviet Union ceased to exist in 1991. ""They grew arrogant and self-confident. They declared victory in the Cold War,"" Gorbachev, 90, said. He insisted that it was ""together"" that Moscow and Washington pulled the world out of confrontation and the nuclear race. ""No, the 'winners' decided to build a new empire. Hence the idea of NATO expansion,"" Gorbachev added. However, he welcomed upcoming security talks between Moscow and Washington. ""I hope there will be a result,"" he said. Last week Moscow presented the West with sweeping security demands, saying NATO must not admit new members and seeking to bar the United States from establishing new bases in former Soviet countries. Putin said Thursday that Washington has been willing to discuss the proposals and talks could happen at the start of next year in Geneva. A senior U.S. official said Washington was ready for talks ""as soon as early January."" Gorbachev resigned as president of the Soviet Union on Dec. 25, 1991, days after the leaders of Belarus, Russia and Ukraine said the U.S.S.R. no longer existed.

They make the following direct demands of the U.S.: “The United States of America shall undertake to prevent further eastward expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and deny accession to the Alliance to the States of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The United States of America shall not establish military bases in the territory of the States of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics that are not members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, use their infrastructure for any military activities or develop bilateral military cooperation with them.” The agreement that Russia proposes to sign with NATO includes obligations that the Alliance exclude further expansion, including the accession of Ukraine, as well as other states, and refuse to conduct “any military activity on the territory of Ukraine, as well as other states of Eastern Europe, Transcaucasia and Central Asia”. Elsewhere, the document calls for a halt to activities that might be perceived as threatening security. “The Parties shall refrain from deploying their armed forces and armaments, including in the framework of international organizations, military alliances or coalitions, in the areas where such deployment could be perceived by the other Party as a threat to its national security, with the exception of such deployment within the national territories of the Parties.” In other words, NATO cannot carry out military activity near Russia’s borders although Russia, on its territory near NATO’s borders, has the right to do as it sees fit. All this simply restates what Moscow has long set out as its position and demands — most actively so in the last several weeks. The real question is why Russian leaders decided to put forward such a document knowing full well that their Western counterparts would reject it and refuse to even discuss its provisions. For the U.S. and NATO, agreeing would mean taking the politically unacceptable step of capitulating to Moscow. Also, why would the West suddenly feel the need for such a revolutionary revision to the post-Cold War system of European security? Simply put, there is not enough of a threat to consider such drastic measures. Moscow, presumably, understands this, indicating that it might have a different goal in mind: to obtain a refusal of its empty gesture so that it can say, “We offered and so we’re not to blame for what we do next”. In other words, the Kremlin is creating a pretext by which it can freely revise the existing system of relations — a step for which it apparently feels the time has come. If this is the case, we can expect Moscow to take steps demonstrating Russia’s determination to unilaterally change the status quo. And, because the scale of the proposals does not allow for simply accepting a refusal from the West and postponing the demands until the next round of diplomatic talks — that would undermine the credibility of the demands — the interesting thing now will be to see what the Kremlin does if it receives the negative response from the West that it apparently sought from the beginning.",1,537,93.43,28.77,40.25,18.04,33.56,28.68,85.29,63.31,52.89,7.64,1.68,0,0.74,0,0,0.93,5.96,18.62,11.36,0.19,16.57,5.96,3.91,5.96,1.12,10.8,6.7,2.42,8.94,2.79,0.56,5.59,12.48,0.19,12.29,2.05,1.49,1.86,2.05,0.74,4.47,0,4.66,2.23,2.42,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.01,5.77,1.12,0.19,1.68,0.37,1.3,2.79,0,0,0,0,7.82,7.08,0.74,0,2.05,0.56,0,1.3,0,0.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.19,0,0.93,0.56,0.19,0,0.19,1.49,0.37,2.98,11.17,0.37,1.3,8.19,0.74,0,0.37,2.61,0.93,4.1,1.86,0,0,0,0,0,11.73,3.91,4.84,0.19,0,0.74,2.05

Lavrov repeated President Vladimir Putin’s scathing criticisms of what Moscow perceives as threatening steps by the West, including NATO expansion eastward. Russia this month issued a series of sweeping security demands to the United States that include NATO withdrawing forces to positions held before the alliance's wave of eastward expansion following the Soviet collapse and banning Ukraine from joining NATO. Lavrov’s hour-long interview on Solovyov’s YouTube channel was published on the same day that the White House announced Russia-U.S. talks on European security on Jan. 10. “Russia can put its concerns on the table and we will put our concerns on the table with Russia’s activities as well,” an unnamed White House official was quoted by AFP as saying. Russia-NATO talks are then expected on Jan. 12, followed by talks with OSCE, Europe’s top security organization which includes the U.S., on Jan. 13. The diplomatic talks will pick up following weeks of Western warnings that Russia is amassing tens of thousands of troops on the Ukrainian border with the possible aim of invading the neighboring country. Putin denies plans of an invasion, instead threatening an “appropriate retaliatory” military response to what he calls the West’s “aggressive stance.” The Russian president said last week he had seen a “positive” response from the U.S. to Moscow's security proposals.",1,298,98.53,61.98,27.14,7.94,19.87,34.9,76.17,51.68,35.57,5.03,2.01,0.34,0.67,0,0.67,0.34,3.02,12.08,9.06,1.34,15.77,3.02,0.67,3.69,0,9.73,6.04,2.68,7.72,2.01,1.01,4.7,4.03,0,4.03,1.01,1.01,0.34,0.34,0,1.01,0,2.68,0.67,2.01,0.34,0,0.34,0,0.34,0,0,13.42,8.72,0.34,1.01,2.01,0.67,4.03,4.36,0,0,0,0.67,8.39,6.71,1.68,0,3.36,0,1.34,2.01,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.34,0,0,0,0,2.35,0,1.34,10.74,0.34,2.68,6.71,1.01,0,0,4.03,3.02,3.36,1.68,0,0,0,0,0,21.14,6.71,3.69,0,0,4.03,6.71

Prosecutors have asked the court to dissolve Memorial's Human Rights Center, which campaigns for political prisoners and other disadvantaged groups, for alleged failures to use the ""foreign agent"" label on all their publications and for justifying terrorism. As the Moscow City Court reconvened to hear the case, dozens of supporters gathered outside and observers were not allowed inside amid the coronavirus outbreak. Speaking in court, the prosecutors said Memorial's failure to properly mark its materials could harm Russians' ""psychological health"" and cause depression. The prosecution also said that the group's website contained information ""justifying terrorism and extremism,"" adding that it ""negatively affects children."" The trial comes in a year that witnessed an unprecedented crackdown on opponents of President Vladimir Putin, including the jailing of top opposition politician Alexei Navalny. But the move to shutter Russia's top rights group stands out and would have been unimaginable a few years ago. Authorities have also brought another case against Memorial International, the group's central structure, which is also accused of violating the ""foreign agent"" law. Next week, Russia's Supreme Court is set to re-convene to hear the case against Memorial International. The two cases are the largest threat to the organization's existence since it was founded in 1989 by rights activists including renowned scientist and Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov. They bookend a year that has seen authorities launch an unprecedented crackdown on the opposition and independent media, imprisoning Navalny in February and banning his organizations. The pressure on Memorial has led to a major outcry in Russia and the West. The Memorial Human Rights Center releases lists of people it says are political prisoners, including Navalny and members of religious minorities such as the Jehovah's Witnesses that have been outlawed in Russia. In October, the organization said there were at least 420 political prisoners in Russia, noting that their number had risen sharply this year. As well as political prisoners, the center also campaigns for groups facing pressure from authorities, including migrants and members of the LGBTQ community. ""Essentially we are doing what prosecutors should be doing, we are helping them,"" Memorial representative Alexander Cherkasov said in court. ""Our work is needed and important,"" he added. Activists have called on Putin to intervene, but he told his human rights council that Memorial had been advocating on behalf of ""terrorist and extremist organizations."" Memorial International coordinates the work of dozens of organizations across Russia. Russia's two living Nobel Peace Prize winners — the last Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Novaya Gazeta newspaper editor Dmitry Muratov — have urged prosecutors to withdraw their claims. ""Memorial is not an 'enemy of the people,'"" Muratov said in his Nobel acceptance speech in Oslo this month. ""Memorial is a friend of the people."" In another case next week, a court in the northwestern city of Petrozavodsk will deliver its ruling on Memorial employee Yury Dmitriyev, a historian the organization says is being targeted for his work exposing the horrors of the Soviet era. Sentenced last year to 13 years in prison on what his supporters say were fabricated child sex charges, he faces two additional years in prison. Memorial, which has become a symbol of post-Soviet democratization, has created a huge archive of Soviet-era crimes. The trial against it coincides with the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Soviet Union marked later this month.",1,585,93.82,61.39,14.57,1.63,22.5,32.14,81.71,55.04,43.59,6.84,2.74,0,0.51,0,1.37,0.85,4.1,15.04,9.06,1.54,14.53,6.5,1.54,4.44,0.51,11.45,5.3,4.1,10.43,1.71,1.71,7.18,5.81,0.17,5.64,0.51,1.71,0.85,0.17,0,2.56,0,5.47,1.2,4.27,0.34,0,0.34,0.17,0,0.17,0,12.14,5.81,0.17,0,1.03,1.37,2.39,6.15,0,0,0,1.37,4.96,3.76,1.03,0.17,3.25,0,0,2.91,0,0.34,3.59,0.51,0.17,0,0.17,0,0.34,0,2.39,0.17,0,0.51,0,0,0,0.34,0.34,0.34,3.42,8.21,0,1.03,6.84,0.17,0.51,0,3.59,5.3,3.08,0.17,0,0,0,0,0,14.87,4.44,4.27,0,0,2.22,3.93

The movie — whose trailer says is dedicated to “our Russian guys” — depicts the real-life events involving Russian mercenaries who fought in Mozambique’s northern Cabo Delgado region in 2019, its director Denis Neymand told The Moscow Times. “The movie was completely based on a Russian private military company in Mozambique. All of this happened in real life,” said Neymand, who also confirmed that Aurum ordered the production of the movie. The Moscow Times, along with other outlets, earlier reported on how hundreds of Russian soldiers fighting for private military company Wagner were deployed in Mozambique, with at least seven of them killed by the Islamic insurgents. Units of the secretive Wagner group have been seen in several conflict zones, allegedly serving Russian private and state interests in Ukraine, Syria and Libya. The group has recently stepped up its efforts on the African continent, fighting in Mozambique and the Central African Republic, and were reportedly invited to Mali this fall. Neymand said it “wasn’t a secret” during filming that the mercenaries on which the movie is based belonged to the Wagner group. “But we didn’t name them in the movie because it doesn’t really matter which private military company operates there. The movie is about showing how Russian guys help Africans against evil forces,” he said, adding that the movie was filmed in the Central African Republic, where Russia has a military presence. The Kremlin in 2019 denied that Russian soldiers were active in Mozambique, while Prigozhin has repeatedly said he has no links to Wagner and has sued media outlets for reporting his alleged connections to the mercenary group. But a number of recent movies produced by Prigozhin-linked firms, including Aurum and the St. Petersburg-based Paritet Film studio, depict Russian “instructors” fighting in eastern Ukraine and the Central African Republic — places where Wagner fighters have also reported to have been active. These movies — which share much of the same acting crew — appear to shed further light on Prigozhin’s links with Wagner. The EU earlier this month slapped sanctions on the group for destabilizing Ukraine and parts of Africa. Prigozhin was not immediately available for comment. Aurum was also behind the film “The Tourist,” which tells the story of a group of young Russian military advisors sent to CAR on the eve of its 2020 presidential elections. Numerous NGOs as well as independent UN observers say that these instructors are in fact paramilitaries from the Wagner Group. A March report by a group of independent UN experts said Wagner mercenaries have committed human rights abuses in CAR. Aurum additionally holds distribution rights for the film “Shugalei,” a movie also directed by Neymand which claims to tell the true story of Maxim Shugalei, a Russian political operative believed to be close to Prigozhin who has spent time in Libyan prison on accusations of meddling in the country’s internal affairs.",1,534,96.01,47.84,22.98,8.14,25.43,31.84,79.59,54.12,42.32,5.99,2.06,0,0.37,0,0.56,0.37,3.93,13.48,9.18,0.94,15.54,5.06,2.81,3.37,0.94,9.93,6.93,1.87,5.62,1.12,0.56,4.12,6.74,0.37,6.37,0.56,1.12,0,0.94,0.75,3.37,0,2.81,0.75,2.06,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.73,6.37,0.94,0,1.69,0.75,2.43,5.24,0,0,0,0.94,7.12,3.37,3.37,0.37,7.68,3,0,4.12,0.19,0.37,0.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.19,2.06,8.43,0.19,0.37,7.3,0.75,0,0,3,5.81,3.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.23,3.93,4.31,0,0,1.5,4.49

Poland this week accused Moscow of having stopped its deliveries via the Yamal-Europe pipeline that sends Russian gas to Western Europe, accusing Gazprom of ""manipulation"". The pipeline was operating in reverse mode this week, sending gas from Germany to Poland, public data showed, as European gas prices ticked up. President Vladimir Putin on Friday denied that the flow direction was a political move and said that Poland had ""sidelined"" Russia in managing the pipeline. ""All accusations against Russia and Gazprom that we are not supplying enough gas to the European market are absolutely groundless and unacceptable and untrue,"" Gazprom spokesman Sergei Kupriyanov said late Saturday, calling the accusations ""lies"". He said some buyers of Russian gas, in particular Germany and France, have not made additional orders, and slammed the reverse flow of gas that came as ""winter is just beginning"" as ""not the most rational decision."" ""I don't even want to talk about the price of such reverse supplies. These prices are significantly higher than the prices for contract volumes set by Gazprom, he said in an interview on state television. ""All problems in Western Europe have been created by themselves and there is no need to blame Gazprom for this. It is better to look in the mirror."" Western countries have for weeks accused Russia of limiting gas deliveries to put pressure on Europe amid tensions over the Ukraine conflict and to push through the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline set to ship Russian gas to Germany. Germany's energy ministry, for its part, on Sunday poured cold water on accusations of Russia withholding deliveries.

This year, the factory worker, who declined to give his last name, said a spike in prices meant he would have to forego caviar and other treats so he could afford a bottle of bubbly for the countdown on Russia's biggest holiday. People are making sacrifices across the country, with soaring inflation pushing up costs and forcing cash-strapped Russians to make difficult decisions around the holidays. ""Everything is getting more expensive but wages aren't going up,"" said Sergei Borisovich, who was shocked that a loaf of bread now costs 100 rubles ($1.35). President Vladimir Putin has described prices as a key concern and the embattled opposition is hoping to leverage the economic woes. This month, inflation reached its highest since 2016, with rising everyday costs hitting hard a population whose average monthly income is 40,402 rubles ($545). Adding to that, some 43% of Russians do not have any savings, according to a recent survey by recruitment website SuperJob. Sergei Borisovich said the table this year would be topped only with a salad of potatoes and peas. ""I'll buy some Shampanskoye if I can,"" he said referring to sparkling wine popular during the Soviet Union. Red caviar, served with bread and butter on New Year's Eve, is the most expensive it has been since monitoring began in 2000. Ingredients for other holiday dishes like the mayonnaise-rich salad ""Olivier"" are expected to cost 15% more than last year, Russian media has reported citing statistics agency Rosstat. ""Herring Under a Fur Coat"" — a layered dish of pickled herring and beetroot — will set Russians back 25% more than last year. Living standards in Russia have been gradually decreasing since Moscow was slapped with a slew of Western sanctions in 2014 over its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. Now, the dip is accelerating, hitting even those in Moscow, the wealthiest city. Karina Strukova, an engineer on maternity leave, says the trend forced her to stop buying groceries from the upmarket Vkusvill grocery chain in favor of the lower-cost Magnit stores. The 30-year-old told AFP her grocery bill had grown by as much as 25% since last year. ""We're trying to cut back on spending a bit because we don't have any other sources of income,"" she said. ""We're buying fewer gifts and going to cheaper shops."" Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, controversially jailed earlier this year on a fraud charge, said he had even felt the pinch behind bars. He wrote on Instagram that food prices have gone up by at least 40% in under a year at a shop where he is allowed to spend 9,000 rubles ($120) a month to supplement his meals. ""The great inflationary tragedy that pensioners are going through is unfolding before my eyes,"" he wrote. Polls have shown that decreasing purchasing power is a major concern for Russians, affecting trust in authorities and Putin's approval ratings. To curb galloping prices, the government has introduced price caps and export quotas, while the central bank has repeatedly hiked its key interest rate. The Russian leader has described inflation as ""the main problem today for both the economy and citizens"" and instructed officials to pull it back from over 8% to 4% in the coming year. But many causes of inflation are global, stemming from spending on post-pandemic recovery and disruptions in supply chains, said Igor Nikolaev of the Institute for Strategic Analysis at FBK Grant Thornton Russia. The situation is made worse in Russia, he said, where there are not enough actors in the market to push prices down. ""When there isn't enough competition, there's no mechanism preventing producers and sellers from increasing prices,"" Nikolaev added. At the market to buy gifts for her grandchildren, 88-year-old pensioner Svetlana Knyazeva says people can get used to anything. ""I can't say I have a bad life,"" she says, adding that she has a pension of almost 30,000 rubles ($400) a month.",1,676,90.31,50.63,19.16,23.98,23.31,23.82,83.14,58.58,44.38,7.25,4.14,0.74,0.44,0,2.51,0,3.11,13.61,7.54,3.11,15.24,7.25,2.07,4.59,1.04,14.79,6.07,6.51,3.4,0.89,0.59,2.07,8.14,0.44,7.4,1.04,2.07,1.18,0.89,0,1.92,0.15,2.96,1.48,1.18,0.89,0.15,0.44,0,0,0.3,0,9.76,4.14,0.44,0,0.15,0.15,2.66,5.03,0.3,0,1.04,1.63,2.07,0.59,1.04,0.44,9.02,1.04,0,2.81,6.21,0,2.81,0.3,0.15,0,0,0.15,0,2.22,0,0.3,0.15,0.74,1.33,0,0,0,0.3,0,4.88,9.17,0,2.22,6.51,0.44,0.15,0.3,4.59,4.73,5.33,1.48,0,0,0,0,0,19.08,4.44,5.77,0,0,1.63,7.25

But a fresh coronavirus wave in the summer was followed by an even more devastating surge in the fall fueled by the Delta variant, which saw Russia registering record cases in deaths and infections. And while Europe and the U.S. managed to curb their death tolls with the aid of mass vaccination campaigns, Russia was unable to follow suit, in large part due to widespread vaccine skepticism. By December, the country had registered over 900,000 excess fatalities since the start of the year, according to The Moscow Times calculations, and experts believe the number could hit the grim milestone of one million excess deaths by the end of the year. Independent demographers believe that Russia’s natural population  — excluding the effects of migration — has seen its largest decline since World War II. Russia’s leadership admitted in November for the first time during the pandemic that its excess mortality rate ⁠— a measure comparing total fatalities from all causes with a pre-pandemic baseline that is seen by demographers and statisticians as the most reliable indicator of lives lost to the pandemic ⁠— was directly linked to Covid-19. The fourth wave, which started in October, was especially deadly for the country, with hospitals once again overflowing and doctors raising the alarm. In the worst-hit month of October, the country saw 3,000 excess deaths a day. While daily infections and deaths have waned as the year-end approaches, virologists have warned that the country should prepare for new deadly waves in the new year, with the more infectious omicron variant gaining ground in a country where only 40% of the population is fully vaccinated. Vaccine diplomacy backfires As 2021 dawned, Russia, under the direction of its vaccine’s developer the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), was eager to boost the nation’s image through so-called vaccine diplomacy. But Sputnik V’s champions quickly found themselves embroiled in a string of scandals. In Slovakia and Brazil, the nation’s health regulators said they could not evaluate the risks and benefits of the vaccine due to a lack of data and inconsistencies in dosages. Argentina, one of the biggest buyers of Sputnik V, on multiple occasions, complained it was in a “very critical situation” as it faced shortages of second doses, which Russia said were more difficult to produce than the first ones. Guatemala also faced shortages, and in July canceled an order for eight million doses because of previous delays. The Moscow Times also investigated a secret scheme through which the RDIF granted a minor UAE royal exclusive rights to resell Sputnik V to at least five developing countries at a significant mark-up. The scheme led to a series of scandals in Lebanon, Kenya and Pakistan while Ghana’s parliament opened an official hearing following the reports. In 2022, Russia is hoping its growing partnership with India — a vaccine-producing powerhouse — will help solve the production issues. The RDIF has already promised to produce an impressive 3 billion doses of Sputnik V next year, as well as “several hundred million Sputnik Omicron boosters” to protect the world against the new strain. But for Sputnik V and other Russian vaccines to be accepted globally, EU and World Health Organization (WHO) approval is critical. At the start of the year, the WHO said its review of how Russia produces the Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine had found some issues with the filling of vials at a plant. Both the EU and the WHO have since said Russian manufacturers have yet to provide regulators with missing data for their ongoing review. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov in December said Russia had a “different understanding of what information was needed” for approval. 2022, the year of mass vaccination? Throughout 2021, the Kremlin grappled with the nation’s stubborn refusal to vaccinate, prompting Russian President Vladimir Putin, who received Sputnik V vaccine early in year, to complain in a public meeting in October that he “can’t understand what’s going on.” “We have a reliable and efficient vaccine. The vaccine really reduces the risks of illness, grave complications and death,” he added. Some critics have blamed the country’s leadership for vaccine skepticism, accusing the government of prioritizing its domestic agenda over the battle against the pandemic. At the height of the summer 2020 wave of infection, Moscow suddenly dropped all restrictions to push through a referendum on constitutional changes that allowed Putin to run for further terms as president, declaring that covid had been defeated. And later in the summer, a short-lived QR code program in Moscow and other cities was quickly abandoned after opposition from restaurateurs ahead of important elections to the Duma, Russia’s lower house of parliament. In the background, state-owned media were downplaying the pandemic and ridiculing other nations for their harsh lockdowns. Others say Russia’s low vaccination rate is part of a wider regional phenomenon, as other post-soviet nations including Ukraine and Armenia are also struggling to convince their populations to get the jab. The Kremlin can take some encouragement from a recent Levada poll showing the percentage of Russians willing to be vaccinated against the coronavirus rose from 15% in August to 19% in October, the highest number since the start of the pandemic. Levada also found that 42% of Russians were in favor of universal mandatory vaccination — up from 38% in June. Still, most of the country remains unvaccinated and Russia's vaccination rate has recently started to fall, after hitting a record 400 thousand doses a day during a short lockdown in November. A number of high-placed officials and top doctors have said that without a new and forceful push that would include nationwide mandatory vaccination, the country is unlikely to hit its target of 70% vaccinated. But Putin, whose electoral rating declined during the second half of 2021, has been wary of throwing his full backing behind unpopular Covid measures and has repeatedly said he is not in favor of forced vaccination and widespread QR codes. The Duma has already announced that it will scrap a proposed bill requiring QR codes to access public transport after criticism from Putin. It remains to be seen if Covid passes and other restrictions will be widely introduced across the country in 2022.",1,1050,97.56,34.1,49.82,4.18,27.63,30.76,83.43,58.57,46.1,4.57,1.52,0,0.1,0,0.38,0.57,3.05,16.38,10.67,3.24,16.67,5.05,2.38,5.52,0.29,9.62,6.95,6.29,4.19,0.38,0.57,3.43,8.38,0.19,8.19,2.1,1.43,1.05,0.48,0.29,2.95,0,5.71,1.81,3.9,0.86,0.1,0.67,0,0,0.19,0,6.76,3.9,0.57,0,1.05,0.48,1.33,2.1,0,0,0,0.38,2.1,1.52,0.57,0,2.67,0.1,0,2.38,0.29,0,6.38,5.05,4.19,0,0,0,0,0.1,1.14,0.38,0.1,0.57,0.1,0.67,0,0.29,0.48,0,3.33,8.95,0.38,1.33,6.67,0.67,0.1,0,6.48,4.76,2,0.76,0,0,0,0,0,12.67,3.71,4.57,0.1,0,1.33,2.95

At the behest of President Vladimir Putin, the Russian Supreme Court on Tuesday and Wednesday ordered the dismantling of the country’s two Memorial organizations: Memorial International, which has systematically documented the murderous atrocities perpetrated in the U.S.S.R by Josef Stalin, and Memorial Human Rights Center, which has promoted respect for human rights and the release of political prisoners in post-Soviet Russia. The forced closure of Memorial, after statements by prosecutors that harkened back to the Stalin era, provides ominous confirmation of Russia’s return to authoritarianism under Putin. The campaign against Memorial comes amid a wide-ranging crackdown by Putin on his political opponents and on activists who support democracy and human rights. Through forceful repression and the manipulation of Russia’s legal system, especially laws on “foreign agents” and “extremism,” the Kremlin has wiped out nearly all safeguards against the revival of Soviet-style abuses. The Supreme Court’s verdict against Memorial was preordained once Putin publicly expressed his disdain for the organization’s efforts to bolster public memory and protect human rights. Memorial began as an experimental movement in the late Soviet era when the far-reaching reforms introduced by Mikhail Gorbachev prompted a small group of leading dissidents and intellectuals in the U.S.S.R. to set up an organization that would pursue accountability for the crimes of the Stalin era. The notion of introducing accountability for abuses committed by political leaders was a stunning departure for the U.S.S.R., whose rulers had carried out terrible crimes with impunity. Soviet officials initially wanted to derail Memorial, but eventually they gave in and allowed it to be formally registered in 1989. During the remainder of the Soviet period, Memorial rapidly grew in influence, establishing itself as one of the world’s most highly respected organizations promoting human rights and historical reckoning. After the Soviet Union broke apart, Memorial survived and continued its work, linking Memorial International and the Memorial Human Rights Center.  During the period of relative freedom in the 1990s, Memorial pushed for the declassification of crucial records, published thick volumes of transcribed documents, and compiled databases of information about millions who were killed under Stalin’s rule.  The scale of Stalin’s crimes made it impractical to achieve a full reckoning with the past, but Memorial achieved more than was ever believed possible to ensure that Russians would have access to information about mass atrocities carried out by the Soviet regime. Memorial also sought to ensure that public officials in Russia would no longer be able to engage in violent abuses without accountability.  The organization publicized the cases of political prisoners, opposed curtailments of rights and freedoms, and decried atrocities carried out during Russia’s two wars in Chechnya. But even as Memorial pursued its invaluable work, obstacles gradually emerged.  In the late 1980s and early 1990s, many Soviet citizens were eager to learn about Stalin’s crimes. But in post-Soviet Russia, the trend was less auspicious.  Public interest in the Stalin era diminished and was gradually replaced by a fatalistic apathy. One of the leading reformers under Gorbachev, Aleksandr Yakovlev, who became a staunch supporter of Memorial’s work, commented in early 2001: “When I read all these materials about Stalin’s terror, I am appalled to see that Kremlin leaders were so cruel and destructive toward their own people. But what worries me even more is that the large majority of people in this country {Russia} nowadays are totally indifferent to this information.” The dwindling level of public interest was reinforced by the rise of Putin and the return to an authoritarian mindset in the Kremlin.  Soon after taking office, Putin revived symbols and features of the Stalin era.  In his address to the Federal Assembly in April 2005 he declared that the disintegration of the U.S.S.R. in late 1991 “was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the [20th] century.” Over time, he tried to prevent condemnations of the Stalin-era repressions, and some of his top aides even defended the abuses. In Dec. 2017, Putin’s long-time head of internal security, Aleksandr Bortnikov, argued that Stalin’s repression of millions had been largely justified because “the enemy was trying to defeat us, either in open battle, or relying on traitors within the country, and with their help stirring up trouble, dividing the people, and paralyzing the state’s capacity to react in a timely and effective manner to emerging threats.” Bortnikov insisted that “archival material shows there were objective grounds for a significant percentage of the criminal cases” during Stalin’s Great Terror. Putin has not gone quite as far as Bortnikov in whitewashing Stalin’s record, but his obfuscations about Soviet-era crimes have become more audacious in the years since Russia went to war against Ukraine. In a nationally broadcast speech announcing Russia’s annexation of Crimea in March 2014, Putin used Stalinist terminology, castigating “traitors” and “fifth columnists” in Russia who were supposedly trying to thwart his bid to restore Russian glory. Two months later, Putin signed into law a bill prohibiting criticism of the Soviet Union’s role in World War II. In the years since then, official images of Stalin as a “great leader” who spearheaded the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany have crowded out attempts to commemorate the tens of millions of victims of Stalin’s repressions. Putin has repeatedly made clear in recent interviews that although certain “excesses” occurred during the Stalin era, these should not detract from the “immense pride” that he and other Russians feel in the “national greatness” of the state built by Stalin. The revival of Stalinist phraseology was jarringly evident this week at the court hearings that liquidated Memorial.  The state prosecutor, Aleksei Zafyarov, accused Memorial of having committed “crude violations” of the “foreign agents” law, but most of his comments focused not on the law or the alleged violations but on Memorial’s work in documenting the Stalinist past. His scathing assessment of Memorial’s work and motives was reminiscent of the invective used by Stalin-era prosecutors in the 1930s and 1940s: It is obvious that ‘Memorial,’ having capitalized on the theme of political repressions in the 20th century, has created a deliberately false image of the U.S.S.R. as a terrorist state and has been whitewashing and rehabilitating Nazi war criminals whose hands are stained with the blood of Soviet citizens. Why should we, as descendants of the victors in that war, now feel obliged to watch the rehabilitation of national traitors and Nazi accomplices? Striking a theme championed by Putin in recent years, Zafyarov emphasized that “we, the descendants of the victors have no need to repent or to be embarrassed. We should be proud of our glorious past!” Although Memorial will be appealing the court’s decision, there is little prospect of success on such a high-profile case. But even if Memorial as a legal entity is now defunct, the guiding force behind the organization since 1989 — the desire to understand why so many millions of people were unjustly killed, tortured, and imprisoned in peacetime at the hands of their own rulers —will undoubtedly persist. Putin’s efforts to curtail scrutiny of the Stalin era may succeed in the short term, but the years of research undertaken by Memorial cannot simply be erased from the historical record. Although a renewed drive for historical accountability may be infeasible until Putin is gone from the scene, a new generation of Russians at some point will want to know why so many innocent people died under Stalin’s regime. The work of Memorial will give a crucial boost to any such quest for understanding.",1,1271,96.69,44.25,36.97,3.79,27.04,31.47,81.98,57.91,46.18,4.64,2.36,0.24,0.39,0,0.87,0.31,2.28,14.71,9.36,2.2,17.62,4.96,3.07,6.14,0.47,8.89,6.53,4.09,9.52,0.94,2.52,6.61,9.21,0.39,8.73,1.42,1.81,1.1,1.02,0.31,2.6,0.16,6.85,2.2,4.41,1.49,0.16,1.1,0.31,0.31,0.08,0,8.58,4.56,0.39,0,1.02,1.65,0.47,3.62,0.16,0.08,0,0.87,4.48,3.15,1.26,0.08,2.36,0,0,2.28,0,0.08,2.99,0.24,0.08,0,0,0,0,0,2.44,0.24,0.24,0.08,0,0.16,0,0.47,0.39,0.31,3.3,9.28,0.55,1.81,6.85,0.39,0,0.16,5.35,4.48,2.12,0.71,0.39,0.39,0,0,0,15.5,4.8,4.72,0.08,0.08,2.05,3.78

Will  Respond Decisively  if Russia Invades Ukraine,English,Russia,"U.S. President Joe Biden on Sunday told his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy that Washington ""will respond decisively"" if Russia moves to invade its pro-Western neighbor, the White House said in a statement. With a Russian military buildup on Ukraine's borders, Biden ""made clear"" to Zelenskiy during a phone call that the ""United States and its allies and partners will respond decisively if Russia invades Ukraine,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. The show of U.S. support for Ukraine comes days after Biden warned Russian President Vladimir Putin of severe consequences if Moscow launches a military invasion. In his call with Zelenskiy, Biden also stressed Washington's commitment ""to the principle of 'nothing about you without you,'"" in an apparent reference to the need to include Ukraine in negotiations about its own future. Zelenskiy tweeted afterwards that he appreciated the United States' ""unwavering support"" and that the call ""proves the special nature"" of the two countries' relationship. High-ranking U.S. and Russian officials are due to sit down on Jan. 9 and 10 in Geneva to discuss the crisis. Earlier this week, Biden spoke to Putin, the two leaders' second conversation by phone in three weeks as tensions mount over Ukraine. Discussing the call with Putin on Friday, Biden said: ""I'm not going to negotiate here in public, but we made it clear he cannot — I'll emphasize, cannot — invade Ukraine."" The U.S. leader added, in remarks to reporters during a holiday stay in Delaware, that he had ""made it clear to President Putin that we will have severe sanctions, we will increase our presence in Europe, with NATO allies"" if Russia invades Ukraine. Psaki also said in Sunday's post-call statement that Biden reaffirmed ""the United States' commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity."" The U.S. leader additionally ""expressed support for confidence-building measures to de-escalate tensions in Donbas and active diplomacy to advance the implementation of the Minsk Agreements."" Under the Minsk agreement — brokered by France and Germany — Ukraine agreed to carry out political reforms while Russia agreed to end its support for pro-Russian separatist rebels. Washington and its European allies accuse Russia of threatening Ukraine with a new invasion. Some 100,000 Russian troops are massed near the border of the country, where Putin already seized the Crimea region in 2014 and is accused of fomenting a pro-Russian separatist war which erupted that same year in the east. Moscow describes the troop presence as protection against the expansion of NATO, although Ukraine has not been offered membership in the military alliance. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke Friday with NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg; afterwards, Blinken urged Russia to ""engage meaningfully"" in the upcoming talks on the tense standoff between Moscow and Kiev. Stoltenberg said that NATO was ""united"" and ""prepared for dialogue."" In Thursday's call, Biden warned Putin against invading Ukraine, while the Kremlin leader said anti-Moscow sanctions would be a ""colossal mistake."" After a 50-minute phone call — their second in just over three weeks — both presidents indicated support for further diplomacy. Putin was ""pleased"" overall with the talks, foreign policy adviser Yury Ushakov told reporters. A senior U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the tone ""was serious and substantive.""",1,531,95.1,54.66,40.25,12.37,24.14,31.45,79.47,53.86,40.87,6.21,2.82,0.38,0.75,0.38,0.94,0.19,3.39,12.81,7.72,2.07,15.82,3.77,2.26,5.08,0.94,11.11,4.9,2.64,9.6,3.2,0.38,6.4,6.78,0.19,6.59,0.94,1.32,0.94,0.75,0.38,3.2,0,4.52,1.88,2.64,0.56,0.38,0.19,0.19,0,0,0,16.57,11.3,2.26,0,1.51,0.38,6.97,5.84,0,0,0,0.94,8.66,6.97,1.13,0.56,4.14,0.19,0.56,3.39,0.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.38,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.13,0,2.64,11.49,0.56,0.94,8.85,0.75,0,0.56,4.33,5.46,2.07,1.88,0.19,0.19,0,0,0,21.66,6.78,4.33,0,0,2.45,8.1

The visit comes as the West tries to deter Moscow from launching an attack on its ex-Soviet neighbour, which has battled pro-Kremlin separatists in two eastern regions bordering Russia since 2014. ""We are here first to reaffirm European Union's full support to Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" Borrell told a press conference with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. ""Any military aggression against Ukraine will have messy consequences and severe costs,"" he said in the village of Stanytsya Luganska in the eastern Lugansk region. ""And we are coordinating with the U.S., with NATO and other like-minded partners in order to work for de-escalation."" Borrell's visit, which he said illuminated ""destinies destroyed"" and ""families divided"", was the first by an EU foreign policy chief to eastern Ukraine since war broke out nearly eight years ago. The timing was right, Borrell said, because ""the geopolitical landscape is changing very quickly and the conflict on the borders of Ukraine is on the verge of getting deeper."" The deployment by Russia of tens of thousands of troops to the border has sparked fears in Kiev and among its Western allies of a wider war in Ukraine. Kuleba said he was ""glad"" the EU foreign policy chief had a chance to visit the frontline and ""feel the consequences of the conflict with his own eyes."" Ukraine and the European Union had a common goal, he said, which is ""to de-escalate the situation through diplomatic means so Moscow reduces tensions and abandons its aggressive intentions."" ""The European Union stands shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine in countering Russia's aggressive policy,"" the Ukrainian foreign minister said. The conflict in eastern Ukraine broke out shortly after Russia seized Crimea and has since claimed over 13,000 lives. Kyiv and its Western allies accuse the Kremlin of fomenting the rebellion, a claim Moscow has repeatedly denied. Russian President Vladimir Putin denies planning to attack the neighbouring country, saying the troop movements are to defend Russia against an encroaching Western military. Last month Moscow presented the West with sweeping security demands, saying NATO must not admit new members, including Ukraine, and seeking to bar the United States from establishing new bases in former Soviet republics. High-ranking officials from the United States and Russia are set to hold two days of talks in Geneva on the crisis starting Sunday. But Brussels fears it is being sidelined as Washington and Moscow discuss the balance of power in Europe. ""The limitation of spheres of influence of two big powers"" are no longer relevant, Borrell said Wednesday. ""There is no security in Europe without security of Ukraine. And it is clear that any discussion on European security must involve the EU and Ukraine. U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has sought to assure European allies that it will act in concert with them, dismissing suggestions that it could seek a Cold War-style agreement that affects Europe without its participation.

Tensions have soared in recent months as the West has warned that Moscow could be planning a full-scale invasion of its neighbour after massing some 100,000 troops at the frontier. High-ranking officials from the United States and Russia are set to hold two days of talks in Geneva on the crisis starting Sunday after the Kremlin issued a raft of demands to Washington. Borrell — who will meet Ukrainian officials in Kiev during his visit from Tuesday to Thursday — has insisted that ""any discussion about European security must happen in coordination with and participation of EU.""  Brussels fears it is being sidelined as the two nuclear powers discuss the balance of power in Europe in talks reminiscent of the Cold War era. Borrell will visit the ""contact line"" where Ukraine's armed forces face off against Russia-backed separatists. Russia seized the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 and is accused of fomenting a bloody conflict in the east of the country that has killed over 13,000. Moscow insists that U.S.-led military alliance NATO must rule out granting membership for ex-Soviet Ukraine and roll back its forces near Russia's border.

It's that the Kremlin actually believes Ukraine is planning a military seizure of Crimea and Donbass — where Russian-backed separatists have occupied territories for nearly eight years now — and Moscow is thus weighing options to pre-empt or respond to a potential offensive as it amasses troops on its south-western borders.  There has been a prevalent tendency in Western analysis to pin this Russian troop buildup — which began last spring and then renewed in earnest this fall — on a specific Russian goal of forcing guarantees of NATO non-expansion and then, in the event of a likely denial, using that as a pretext to invade Ukraine. There are limits to what we can know about Russian intentions, especially given that Russian foreign policy, while aggressive, tends to be more reactive than proactive. But one possibility that hasn’t really been factored into the various predictions of how Russia will act this winter is that the escalation is as much about Donbass as it is about NATO. Consider last week’s comments by Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who criticized the West for increasing weapons supplies to and conducting military drills with Ukraine. “The Kiev regime naturally perceives this support as a carte blanche for the use of force,” he said. “An adequate response will be given to any possible provocations by Kiev against Donbass.” Such comments — especially taken with the recent uncharacteristically aggressive warnings of his deputy Sergei Ryabkov — could be dismissed as merely part of a control drama, a deception staged by Moscow to indicate it is serious. But why the additional explanatory rhetoric when its troop amassments alone are quite enough for heavy metal diplomacy, if that is indeed all this was? Looking closely at the statements coming out of Moscow in recent months there has been a consistent strand where it essentially warns the West against backing a Ukrainian offensive. On Nov. 18, a few weeks after reports began emerging about Russian troop buildup, Vladimir Putin made his now famous “red lines,” statement, widely seen as the first harbinger of Moscow’s ultimatum for a new European security architecture on its own terms. But in his speech, he identified “Ukraine’s internal crisis” and its “failure to fulfill [Minsk] obligations” as Russia’s most pressing security issue. The West was “exacerbating” the situation by supplying Kiev with weapons. Putin quite clearly said “tensions should remain” — i.e. Russia would not deescalate — so long as there was risk of “them” — i.e. Ukraine and NATO — “staging some kind of conflict” on Russia’s western border. Then on Nov. 24, Security Council head Nikolai Patrushev alleged that the “West destroyed” Ukraine’s economy; as a result the country could “set ablaze” causing a security crisis for Russia, with an influx of thousands of refugees. It’s not clear how exactly Patrushev imagined Ukraine would “set ablaze,” and while Ukrainian domestic turbulence would affect the war in Donbass, it’s not easy to understand how this domestic turbulence would directly impact Russia’s security. Unless, that is, one imagines a highly unlikely scenario in which Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s government collapses, nationalist hardliners take over, and, with NATO assistance in the form of lethal weapons, attempt to retake Crimea and Donbass by force. Yet Ukraine has denied any such plans, while Zelenskiy has repeatedly affirmed his commitment to peace, all but ruling out any imminent military solution on Ukraine’s part. Why does Moscow, if its comments are genuine, continue to believe it? However unlikely a hardline nationalist offensive against Crimea or the Donbass may be, the Russians' concerns in part reflect Ukrainian politicians' own rhetoric.  Two of Ukraine’s military commanders have openly threatened Russia with force. In June, former special operations commander Serhiy Kryvonos said Ukraine should be ready to strike Russia with a swift “knockout” once it is weakened. To be fair, he did say that until that opportunity arises Ukraine should demonstrate its commitment to a peaceful resolution of the Donbass conflict. The current commander in chief of the armed forces, Valery Zalushny said in September that he'd like to drive a tank through Red Square. Granted, both these comments were made on prime-time public television — and the latter in response to a viewer’s question — but one would question the wisdom of trolling a powerful and paranoid neighbor that has a track record of taking such comments far too seriously. But it’s not just the rhetoric that the Russians seem to be responding to. In their view, a vocal, nationalist minority in Ukraine has consistently stymied all of Zelenskiy’s efforts to follow the Minsk Package of Measures toward a peaceful solution to Donbass. Alas, they are not wrong. In March 2020, Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, Andryi Yermak, met with the Kremlin’s point man on the Donbass issue, Dmitry Kozak, and agreed on a special Advisory Council in which Ukrainian officials would discuss the peace process with representatives of the Russian-backed separatist governments. In return, he was slapped with criminal charges by the SBU. Discussing peace with separatist leaders – something specifically stipulated in the Minsk agreements which Kiev signed – was deemed tantamount to treason. The charges didn’t go anywhere, but the damage was done. Talks ground to a halt. For Zelenskiy, any peaceful solution to Donbass seemed to have become toxic. To survive politically, he had to signal that he was determined to return Crimea — as with the summer 2021 creation of the Crimean Platform, intended to bring back the peninsula that Russia illegally annexed in 2014. The Russians seem to have read this as the final nail in the coffin of the Minsk agreement. Ukraine has no plan to follow through on peacefully reintegrating the statelets in Donbass. The only alternative, the Russians imagine, must be to retake the territories — as well as Crimea — by force. This triggered a change in Moscow’s policy towards Ukraine, and the renewed troop buildup this fall appears part of that change. The new approach was formulated by Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chairman of the security council who penned an uncharacteristically hawkish column arguing that Ukraine wasn’t a real country and therefore it was useless to talk to it. To get anything done, Russia deemed, it should really be seeking guarantees from the United States and NATO, and in Moscow’s view such adversaries only take force seriously. Once again, however unrealistic — and possibly outright delusional, since neither Ukraine nor other NATO members are actually beholden to Washington — this view from Moscow is, it is also backed by history. When a western-leaning politician, Mikheil Saakashvili, came to power in Georgia on the back of a popular coup in 2004, his first move was to try to rein in three pro-Russian separatist breakaway states — Adjara, South Ossetia, and Abkhazia as part of a wider bid of eventually joining NATO. Buoyed by the success of Adjara renouncing its separatist aspirations without a bullet being fired, and inspired by what he thought were promises of U.S. and NATO support, Saakashvili began to prepare to bring Abkhazia and South Ossetia back into the fold, this time militarily. For four years, Russia prepared for and anticipated his strike. This mutual escalation — both political and military — culminated in the Russia-Georgia war of 2008, when Russian troops invaded Georgia, pushed it out of Ossetia and Abkhazia, and officially recognized the two breakaway states as independent. Zelenskiy is no Saakashvili. He seems to have few illusions about NATO membership, and there is no real preparation in Ukraine to pull off what Saakashvili thought he could pull off in 2008. Moreover, both NATO and Washington have made it pretty clear that neither NATO nor U.S. troops would be fighting alongside Ukrainians in the event of a war with Russia. But for the Russians, this message has not been clear enough. It has also been muddled by developments in Ukraine, where there is a consistent mismatch between what Zelenskiy is saying he is committed to on the one hand, and his administration’s actions and the hawkish threats made by some military officials and commentators on the other. There is a stated commitment to the peaceful reintegration of rebel-held territories in Donbass, but in practice any proposed plan by the Zelenskiy administration for actually doing so is stymied. Meanwhile, the focus remains on NATO and U.S. support for Ukraine in the form of lethal weapons and military advisers, and on other measures of deterrence against Russia. These are all mixed messages in Russia’s view, and given that Ukraine doesn’t seem to have a plan on how to follow through on the Minsk agreement or work through the inherent inconsistencies in the document, Moscow seems to have chosen to operate on the assumption that while not necessarily imminent, a Georgian scenario is possible and even likely.  It is responding in kind. In September, I heard from a Kremlin adviser in the nationalist camp that Russia was preparing to officially recognize the statelets. At the time, I brushed aside the remarks as wishful thinking, but since then chatter to this effect has increased – not just among nationalist and patriotic outlets and experts, but in the more diplomatically oriented Russian International Affairs Council. Recognition of the statelets is costly for Russia — it means giving up on the Minsk scenario of reintegrating them back into Ukraine and having to sponsor them forever, bearing the costs of additional Western sanctions. But the current stalemate — where Russia feels it has to support the statelets and be prepared indefinitely to defend them and their borders from what it believes to be an unstable and belligerent Ukraine — is also costly and unsustainable. Now, according to a report last week in the respected Kommersant daily, government officials said that while Russia was not planning any unprovoked invasion, they were weighing recognizing the statelets and officially sending troops there in the event that talks with Washington fail to produce a satisfactory agreement. It is highly unlikely, if next to impossible, that the U.S. will agree wholesale to Russia’s shopping list, as Moscow has demanded. But while the new security architecture Russia is demanding doesn’t directly mention Donbass, it’s increasingly clear that the current escalation is about pushing for some kind of solution to the eight-year conflict — whether through a new security architecture, or, more modestly, through a new Minsk agreement that will be more palatable to Kiev than the current one. In some ways, all that’s left for the United States to do is precisely what the Biden administration has taken to doing. No breakthrough is going to come from the Jan. 10 talks, but they are a necessary platform where U.S. officials can hear Russian concerns and hopefully dispel misconceptions about what the U.S. is prepared to do – and especially what the U.S. is not prepared to do – when it comes to supporting Ukraine. But when it comes to support, that support should be as much, if not more, about helping Ukraine decide on what it actually wants to do about Donbass, and stick to it, for the sake of its own safety and integrity, as it is about deterring Russia.",1,1872,84.15,26.98,41.49,22.91,26.74,31.25,81.36,62.23,50.69,6.78,1.71,0.11,0.05,0,0.96,0.48,5.07,14.21,7.69,1.39,16.29,7.53,4.97,6.78,1.28,13.25,5.88,3.42,6.14,0.91,1.5,4.01,14.96,0.75,14,3.21,2.03,1.34,2.67,1.18,4.11,0,3.95,2.08,1.87,0.64,0.21,0.43,0.05,0.37,0,0,7.48,4.01,0.59,0.05,0.85,0.43,1.76,3.04,0,0,0,1.07,4.65,3.47,1.12,0.05,1.87,0.05,0.05,1.44,0.27,0.05,0.53,0.27,0.05,0,0.11,0,0,0,0.16,0.48,0.21,0.43,0,0.27,0,0.16,1.01,0.11,2.62,8.87,0.32,1.18,6.89,0.59,0.16,0.16,3.74,3.1,4.54,1.92,0.05,0,0.05,0,0,14.26,4.7,5.45,0.11,0,1.87,2.14

What could an agreement look like, and how likely is it? The talks have begun according to a Russian timetable and framed by Russia’s draft treaties with the United States and NATO. These proposals — in reality, sweeping demands — are unacceptable and their rejection may be intended to serve as the pretext for renewed aggression against Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin himself remarked on the “sceptical smiles” of his Foreign Ministry audience when he tasked it to prepare them. It is unthinkable that, as Russia threatens a massive use of force in Europe, NATO would de facto reverse its post-1997 enlargement, or America withdraw its nuclear weapons from the continent. Russia’s demands are, in any case, misdirection. Its immediate concern is not the 25-year history of NATO enlargement, but its own currently declining influence over Ukraine — whose Western ties are growing deeper, resistance to local pro-Russian figures like Viktor Medvedchuk sterner, and national identity stronger. Since time is not on Putin’s side, he is seeking to assert dominance over Kyiv while this is still possible, a goal hardened by his view that Ukraine is an essential part of Russia. Russia’s real driver, then, is more status and identity than security. These are harder goals for diplomacy to address. Security can be cooperative and mutual, as the U.S.-Russian agreement to extend the New START nuclear treaty last February showed. But great power revisionism is incompatible with the principle of sovereign equality that underpins international order, and threatens the security of other states. Nonetheless, the West has decided to engage with Russia rather than reject its demands outright. What can it discuss?  Russia’s ostensible and chronic grievance — NATO enlargement — and its real and urgent concern — Ukraine — overlap on the issue of Ukraine’s potential membership of NATO. Some seasoned Western diplomats with no illusions about Russia have long expressed concern over NATO’s 2008 Bucharest summit, which declared that Georgia and Ukraine “will become members of NATO.” Russia’s occupation of Ukrainian territory in practice makes it very unlikely that NATO would extend a collective security commitment to Ukraine. Russia’s own aggression has provided the assurance that it now demands of NATO. Does this mean, as some argue, that NATO should now assure Russia that Ukraine will never join? Critics condemn this as betraying a victim of aggression. But the argument should be addressed, not condemned. Western governments are accountable to their populations and guided by national interest. Last year they concluded that these interests were no longer compatible with long-standing commitments to Afghanistan, and swiftly abandoned the country to its fate, an outcome that probably emboldened the Kremlin’s coercion of Ukraine. Is it in the West’s interest to accommodate Russia’s designs on Ukraine? No, this realist case is flawed. Russia’s behaviour offers no assurance that a favorable deal would satisfy it. Not only do Russia’s demands on Ukraine extend far beyond the question of NATO membership, but it has never signalled that its interests are limited to Ukraine, or even to the territory of the former Soviet Union as a whole. On the contrary, through military, cyber, informational and energy instruments, Russia is pursuing a more assertive policy towards Europe — and not only NATO members — than during much of the Cold War. Its sweeping demands for NATO’s retreat only underscore the extent of its ambitions. A settlement over Ukraine would not be a solution, but a prelude. It would make the West less, not more, secure. Nor is constraining Ukraine’s freedom of choice likely to produce even local stability. In 2014 Russian pressure to stop former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych from signing an association agreement with the European Union triggered the mass demonstrations that forced him from power. With 72% of Ukrainians now viewing Russia as a threat, its diktat will not be accepted quietly. In short, the case against Realist accommodation is not only ethical but practical: In the 21st century, spheres of influence neither satisfy large aggressors nor can easily be imposed on small victims. But the West can usefully discuss some specific Russian concerns — not least as some would involve restrictions on actions the West has no intention of undertaking, such as deploying missiles in Ukraine that can hit Russia. But there should be no unilateral concessions — any offer requires a quid pro quo. Creative exploration of this nexus offers the best prospect of an agreement, even though Russia’s violation of past commitments, and the illegitimacy of its current position as an occupier of Ukraine, make this more difficult. But even in the best case, the win-set is small. Diplomatic success requires Russia to scale back its demands very substantially. It will only do so if it is persuaded that renewed aggression will bring more costs than benefits. The West can improve the slim chance of agreement by managing the diplomatic process in two ways. First, it must maintain the agreed negotiating format. Despite Russia’s clear preference for dealing only with the U.S. and major European powers, America has secured a three-track process that includes NATO and the OSCE as well as bilateral talks. It should make clear that all three tracks are equally important. This ensures the participation of all European states, including Ukraine and virtually guarantees there will be no rapid outcome. An inclusive process demonstrates Western cohesion and slows down the crisis. Second, the West must visibly plan for the worst case to show Russia it faces a severe and united response to renewed aggression. This will include severe economic and financial sanctions, and may cause Finland and Sweden to move closer to NATO membership. This would continue a trend of Russian actions producing the opposite effects to those intended, in this case, a stronger, larger NATO. In short, the West — not only the U.S. but Europe too — should conceive and conduct its diplomacy as part of, and not an alternative to, deterrence. This offers the main hope of averting Russian renewed aggression and the biggest clash of conventional forces in Europe since 1945.",1,1015,78.6,17.13,17.66,12.07,19.15,33,80.79,59.21,47.59,7.49,1.08,0,0,0,0.59,0.39,6.4,15.57,7.49,1.28,13.5,7.09,3.55,6.6,2.36,9.56,10.15,3.74,6.9,1.28,1.28,4.43,13.5,1.08,12.41,1.28,2.27,2.27,1.48,0.69,4.63,0,5.12,2.17,2.96,1.08,0.2,0.89,0,0.89,0,0,8.28,5.71,0.39,0.3,1.58,0.49,1.28,2.36,0,0,0,0.59,4.93,3.35,1.28,0.3,1.97,0,0.2,1.28,0.3,0.2,0.3,0.1,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.79,0.1,0.1,0,0.2,0,0.39,1.18,0.49,3.45,7.59,0.49,0.69,5.71,0.59,0.1,0.1,3.55,1.28,4.53,1.58,0,0,0,0,0,14.19,5.42,5.22,0.39,0,1.87,1.28

Meeting senior Kremlin envoys at their headquarters in Brussels, the NATO members said Moscow would have no veto on Ukraine or any other country joining the alliance, warning it would pay a high price if it invaded. ""Russia most of all will have to decide whether they really are about security, in which case they should engage, or whether this was all a pretext, and they may not even know yet,"" U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said. Putin's government has demanded the West to rule out accepting new members like Ukraine, Georgia or Finland on its eastern flank and has demanded limits on allied deployments in the former Soviet allies that joined NATO after the Cold War. Russia's massive troop build-up on Ukraine's borders has forced Washington to engage diplomatically — with bilateral security talks in Geneva on Monday, a NATO-Russia meeting on Wednesday and another planned at the OSCE in Vienna on Thursday. But the Western allies have received no promise that Russia will stand down its forces — which Moscow insists pose no threat to its already partially occupied neighbor — despite threatening massive economic sanctions if the Kremlin unleashes an invasion. Instead, the 30 member states invited the Russian envoys to return to Moscow and to advise Putin to join them for a series of confidence-building talks on limiting provocative military exercises, arms control and reciprocal limits on deploying missiles. ""Russia was not in a position to agree on that proposal. They didn't reject it either, but the Russian representatives made it clear that they needed some time to come back to NATO with an answer,"" alliance Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned: ""There are significant differences between NATO allies and Russia on these issues,"" he warned. Stoltenberg said it would be impossible for NATO members to agree to Moscow's core demands for a new security order in Europe, and in particular added that Russia would have no veto on Ukraine's right to eventually join the alliance. ""Ukraine as a sovereign nation... has the right to self-defense. Ukraine is not a threat to Russia,"" he said. ""It is Russia that is the aggressor. It is Russia that has used force and continues to use force against Ukraine. ""And then they're building up, with around 100,000 troops, artillery, armour, drones, tens of thousands of combat-ready troops and threatening rhetoric — that's the problem."" The West defends NATO's ""open-door policy"" towards potential future members, while Moscow is demanding a cast-iron guarantee that the alliance will not expand further towards its territory, seeing the westward tilt of one-time Warsaw Pact or Soviet allies as a threat. Before Wednesday, the NATO-Russia council had not met since 2019. NATO and Russia broke off practical cooperation in 2014 after Moscow occupied and annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea. Russia's diplomatic mission to the alliance was withdrawn in October last year after eight of its staff were expelled on allegations of espionage. But the former ambassador — now a deputy foreign minister — Alexander Grushko was back to confront Stoltenberg and Sherman, having earlier this week described the meeting as a ""moment of truth."" After the meeting, the senior U.S. diplomat said: ""Together, the United States and our NATO allies made clear we will not slam the door shut on NATO's open-door policy. ""NATO has never expanded through force or coercion or subversion. It is countries' sovereign choice to choose to come to NATO and say they want to join."" Just ahead of the talks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""The continuation of NATO's open-door policy and the further advancement of NATO towards our borders is precisely what, from our point of view, threatens us. ""This is exactly what we are asking not to continue through legally-binding guarantees."" The allies have threatened massive economic and financial sanctions against Moscow if its huge troop build-up on Ukraine's frontiers and in Russian-occupied Crimea turns into a new invasion.

S ., Russia Hold High - Stakes Talks on Ukraine",English,Russia,"Top U.S. and Russian officials held crucial talks Monday with tensions soaring over Ukraine and security demands from Moscow, but there was little hope of a diplomatic breakthrough. The high-stakes negotiations come amid fears of a Russian invasion of its pro-Western neighbor Ukraine, and with Moscow demanding wide-ranging concessions from Washington and its NATO allies. Monday's talks in Geneva launch a week of diplomacy between Russia and the West after Moscow amassed tens of thousands of troops at the Ukrainian border, drawing the United States into a Cold War-style stand-off. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov opened their meeting at the U.S. mission in Geneva at 8:55 a.m. (07:55 GMT). A convoy of black vehicles with Russian diplomatic plates had arrived shortly before, and was ushered through the large iron gates under a billowing U.S. flag. The two diplomats had already met informally in the Swiss city on Sunday evening, with Ryabkov afterwards telling Russian news agencies the first meeting had been ""difficult."" State news agency RIA Novosti on Monday quoted Ryabkov saying he feared Washington was not taking seriously Moscow's demand of an end to NATO's eastward expansion. Pointing to a 2008 promise by NATO to consider membership for Ukraine and others, Ryabkov said: ""Are they ready to give legal guarantees that this country, as well as other countries... will not join NATO?"" ""I have a rather pessimistic forecast in this regard."" Sherman said on Twitter that the talks were underway but there would be little progress without others at the table. ""The U.S. will listen to Russia's concerns and share our own, but we have been clear we will not discuss European security without our allies and partners,"" she said. Sherman in the talks on Sunday had stressed ""the freedom of sovereign nations to choose their own alliances,"" the State Department said. In the muddy trenches on the frontline in Ukraine, where Kyiv's forces have been battling pro-Russian fighters since 2014, there was little hope for diplomacy. ""I doubt that anything will change,"" 29-year-old soldier Mykhailo said as he walked through trenches in the town of Avdiivka, just north of the separatist stronghold city of Donetsk. ""Guarantees of not joining NATO will never stop"" Russian President Vladimir Putin, Mykhailo said, adding: ""He wants to return the Soviet Union in version 2.0."" Both sides have set firm lines, with Washington warning that Moscow would face severe diplomatic and economic consequences from an invasion of Ukraine, and Russia demanding wide-ranging new security arrangements with the West. After Monday's talks, a meeting of the NATO-Russia Council will take place in Brussels on Wednesday, then the permanent council of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) will meet in Vienna on Thursday with the issue of Ukraine expected to dominate. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken stressed Sunday that Russia had to choose between dialogue and confrontation, warning on CNN that there would be ""massive consequences for Russia if it renews its aggression on Ukraine."" Blinken warned that any positive outcome from the talks would rely in part on Russia's willingness to stand down from its aggressive posture, which he likened to ""an atmosphere of escalation with a gun to Ukraine's head."" Any direct military action by the United States or NATO in defense of Ukraine is extremely unlikely. But Western officials have warned Moscow would face significant economic and financial consequences if it invades, and could see NATO boost its presence and capacities near Russia's borders. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Monday that the alliance would be warning Russia of the ""severe costs"" of an invasion. He said he did not expect this week's talks to ""solve all the issues,"" but wanted to kickstart a diplomatic process. ""We are aiming for an agreement on a way forward, a process, a series of meetings,"" Stoltenberg said before talks with Ukraine's deputy prime minister in Brussels. Measures against Russia under consideration include sanctions on Putin's inner circle, canceling Russia's controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany or, in the most drastic scenario, severing Russia's links to the world's banking system. Moscow insists it was deceived after the Cold War and understood that NATO would not expand eastward. Instead, the U.S.-led alliance welcomed most of the former Warsaw Pact countries and the three Baltic nations that were under Soviet rule. Russia has put intense pressure on Ukraine since 2014 after a revolution overthrew a government that had sided with the Kremlin against moving closer to Europe. Russia seized the Crimean peninsula and backs an insurgency in eastern Ukraine in which more than 13,000 people have died.

After more than seven hours of negotiations in Geneva, the Russian and U.S. negotiators both offered to keep talking, though there was no sign of a major breakthrough. The high-stakes negotiations came amid fears of a Russian invasion of its pro-Western neighbor Ukraine, and with Moscow demanding wide-ranging concessions from Washington and its NATO allies. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said he had assured his U.S. counterpart, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, that those fears were unfounded. ""We explained to our colleagues that we have no plans, no intentions to 'attack' Ukraine... There is no reason to fear any escalation in this regard,"" he told reporters after the talks. Ryabkov said the United States ""took Russian proposals very seriously"" and that Moscow was ""for the continuation of dialogue."" Sherman said that she offered to make reciprocal moves with Russia on missiles and exercises, but renewed warnings of major costs if Moscow invaded Ukraine. She said the United States was ready to meet again, but that Russia had not offered assurances that it will pull back troops amassed near Ukraine. And she insisted that some of Russia's demands were ""simply non-starters,"" including a ban on NATO's further eastward expansion. ""We will not allow anyone to slam closed NATO's open-door policy,"" Sherman said. Monday's talks in Geneva launched a week of diplomacy between Russia and the West after Moscow amassed tens of thousands of troops at the Ukrainian border, drawing the United States into a Cold War-style stand-off.

After Monday's talks, a meeting of the NATO-Russia Council will take place in Brussels on Wednesday, then the permanent council of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) will meet in Vienna on Thursday with the issue of Ukraine expected to dominate. Sherman renewed a call on Russia to pull back its estimated 100,000 troops. If Russia invades, she said, ""there will be significant costs and consequences, well beyond what they faced in 2014,"" when Moscow seized the Crimean peninsula and backed an insurgency in eastern Ukraine. Ryabkov denounced U.S. threats as ""attempts at blackmail and intimidation,"" but said ""I don't think the situation is hopeless.""

The European Union's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the bloc was mobilizing ""all its resources"" to aid its ally after the attacks temporarily brought down sites, including those of the foreign ministry and cabinet. Kyiv said the damage was limited and held back on apportioning blame but the ex-Soviet country has accused Russians with links to Moscow for previous hits on websites and key infrastructure. ""As a result of a massive cyberattack, the websites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a number of other government agencies are temporarily down,"" a foreign ministry spokesman told AFP. The foreign ministry website earlier Friday displayed a message in Ukrainian, Russian and Polish warning Ukrainians that their personal data had been compromised. ""All information about you has become public, be afraid and expect the worst,"" the message read. The education ministry also said its website had been targeted in a ""global"" hack overnight while the emergencies ministry site was brought down as well. Within hours of the initial announcement, the SBU security services said access to most sites had been restored and that the fallout was minimal according to initial estimates. ""The content of sites has not been changed and according to preliminary information no personal data was leaked,"" the SBU security service said in a statement. The SBU said access to many of the affected sites had been restored with the remainder to return online ""soon."" Kyiv has not yet blamed any individual or entities and Borrell said it was too early ""to point the finger at anybody. We don't have proof."" But he added: ""You can imagine who did this."" In October 2020, the United States charged six Russians with carrying out cyber attacks on Ukraine's power grid, the 2017 French elections and the 2018 Winter Olympics. The Justice Department at the time said the six were current or former members of the GRU Russian military intelligence and were also accused of staging a malware attack called ""NotPetya"" that infected computers of businesses worldwide causing nearly $1 billion in losses. The latest attack came at a time of soaring tensions between Russia and the West over Ukraine, a close ally of the United States and Europe. The West has accused Russia of deploying tanks, artillery and about 100,000 soldiers on Ukraine's war-torn eastern border in recent weeks, in what NATO says is preparation for an invasion. Moscow says it has no plans to invade Ukraine. Footage published by the Russian Defense Ministry Friday showed Russian tanks and infantry carrying out firing drills near the city of Rostov-on-Don in southern Russia near Ukraine. Moscow says this is a response to what it sees as the growing presence of NATO in its sphere of influence, where it fiercely opposes the expansion of the Atlantic alliance. Russia also says the U.S.-led military alliance should not admit Ukraine or Georgia as new members. This week the United States and its NATO allies held talks with Russia in an attempt to ease tensions, but all three rounds of negotiations — in Geneva, Brussels and Vienna — proved unsuccessful. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Thursday that Moscow saw no reason to hold a new round of security talks with the West following a lack of progress. Ryabkov also said he did not rule out the possibility that Moscow could deploy forces to allies Venezuela or Cuba if diplomacy failed.",1,587,94.12,42.07,50.79,2.72,24.46,29.64,82.96,58.26,44.46,4.77,1.19,0,0.17,0.34,0.34,0.17,3.58,14.99,10.05,1.53,14.31,5.79,2.21,6.13,1.36,11.93,6.64,3.24,6.47,1.53,0.68,4.26,8.18,1.02,7.16,1.53,1.53,0.85,1.87,0.17,2.39,0,4.26,0.85,3.41,0.34,0,0.34,0.17,0.17,0,0,11.07,8.18,1.36,0,1.53,1.02,4.09,3.58,0,0.34,0,0.51,7.67,4.43,1.53,1.7,2.39,0.17,0.17,2.04,0.17,0,0.34,0.17,0.17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.17,0,0,0.51,0,0,0,0.85,0,2.39,11.58,0.17,1.36,9.03,0.68,0,0.51,5.11,8.01,3.41,0.68,0,0,0,0,0,12.44,4.43,2.9,0,0,0.68,4.43

S ., Russia Hold High - Stakes Talks on Ukraine War Fears",English,Russia,"Russia ruled out Sunday any concession at talks with the United States on soaring tensions over Ukraine, as Moscow, facing strong pressure to pull back troops, seeks a wide-ranging new security arrangement with the West. Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told Russian news agencies ahead of his talks in Geneva the Kremlin was ""disappointed"" with signals coming from Washington and from Brussels, where NATO and the European Union are based. The high-level discussions kick off a week of diplomacy in which Russia will meet with NATO and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), as the United States tries to assure European allies they will not be sidelined. Since late last year, Russia has amassed tens of thousands of troops at the Ukrainian border and demanded guarantees that NATO will not expand further eastward. The Kremlin is insisting NATO must never grant membership to ex-Soviet Ukraine, which is pushing to join. The United States, to be represented by Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, agreed to talks even though it made plain that many of Moscow's proposals are non-starters. Originally scheduled to start on Monday, Sherman is now due to have a working dinner with Ryabkov on Sunday evening, said a State Department spokesperson. Russia's Foreign Ministry posted footage of Ryabkov's plane arriving in Geneva. ""We will not agree to any concession. That is completely excluded,"" Ryabkov said before departing. ""We are disappointed with the signals coming in the last few days from Washington but also from Brussels."" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, dismissing Moscow's demands as ""gaslighting"", has insisted that talks will yield no progress so long as Russia has a ""gun to Ukraine's head."" ""We're prepared to respond forcefully to further Russian aggression. But a diplomatic solution is still possible and preferable if Russia chooses it,"" Blinken said Friday. Russian President Vladimir Putin met his US counterpart Joe Biden in Geneva in June and agreed on regular ""stability"" talks between Sherman and Ryabkov. In two phone calls to Putin, Biden has warned of severe consequences if Russia invades Ukraine. Measures under consideration include sanctions on Putin's inner circle, cancelling Russia's controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany or, in the most drastic scenario, severing Russia's links to the world's banking system. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, warned that Washington would also send more troops to eastern NATO members such as Poland and the Baltic states if Russia invaded Ukraine. Europeans have showed solidarity, with EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell visiting the frontline in Ukraine, although some nations are expected to hesitate at the strongest measures. ""Whatever the solution, Europe has to be involved,"" EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said. Russia insists it was deceived after the Cold War and understood that NATO would not expand. Instead, the U.S.-led alliance welcomed most of the former Warsaw Pact countries and the three Baltic nations that were under Soviet rule. Russia has put intense pressure on Ukraine since 2014 after a revolution overthrew a government that had sided with the Kremlin against moving closer to Europe. Russia seized the Crimean peninsula and backs an insurgency in eastern Ukraine in which more than 13,000 people have died. At a time when Russia is also intervening to shore up allies facing popular uprisings in Belarus and Kazakhstan, Moscow has insisted it wants concrete progress in talks with Washington. Putin's foreign policy adviser Yury Ushakov warned after the call with Biden that the United States would make a ""colossal mistake"" if it went ahead with sanctions. ""It is very likely that we will encounter the reticence of our U.S. and NATO colleagues to really perceive what we need,"" Ryabkov said Sunday. In spite ""of the threats that are constantly formulated against us ... we wil make no concession,"" he said, adding it would ""amount to acting against the interests of our seccurity."" NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg, meeting foreign ministers of the alliance on Friday, said there remained real risks of a Russian invasion. But John Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, described the Russian troop build-up as a ""gigantic bluff"" by Putin to seek a negotiated agreement. ""They are trying to see if the Biden administration or Europe will blink,"" said Herbst, now at the Atlantic Council think tank. ""As long as the Biden administration remains at least as strong as it is now,"" he said, ""it probably is enough to keep Putin from striking large into Ukraine, but I don't rule out something smaller.""

After talks with U.S. diplomats in Geneva and with more negotiations to come in Brussels, ""it's too early to tell whether the Russians are serious about the path to diplomacy or not,"" Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters. Psaki said it remained to be seen ""if they're prepared to negotiate seriously — we are — or whether they'll use discussions as a pretext that diplomacy couldn't possibly work."" The next round of talks will be between NATO and Russia on Wednesday, with a third session between the OSCE regional security body and Russia planned for Thursday. Washington and its European allies are pressuring Russia to pull a large force back from the border with Ukraine, while Moscow is pushing the West to agree to a long list of what the Kremlin says are security guarantees. Psaki reiterated the U.S. rejection of Russia's demand that Ukraine not be offered NATO membership one day, saying this is ""a matter only for Ukraine and the 30 NATO allies, not for other countries to determine."" ""There are a range of discussions that can be part of a diplomatic path but ultimately it's up to the Russians to determine about whether they're going to take a serious approach to it or not,"" she said.",1,230,80.5,18.24,71.83,15.38,32.86,25.65,88.7,68.7,53.04,6.96,2.17,0,0.43,0,0.43,1.3,4.78,12.17,8.26,1.3,17.39,9.13,4.78,7.83,2.17,17.83,7.83,3.04,4.78,1.74,0.87,2.17,13.04,0,13.04,2.17,0.87,0.87,2.17,0.87,6.52,0,1.3,0.43,0.87,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.3,8.26,1.3,0.43,0.43,0,5.65,3.91,0,0,0.43,0,4.78,3.48,1.3,0,4.35,0,0.43,3.91,0,0,0.43,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.43,0,0,0,0,1.3,0,3.04,10.43,0,1.74,7.83,0.87,0,0.43,4.35,3.04,7.39,3.04,0.43,0,0.43,0,0,15.22,4.78,3.04,0,0,3.04,4.35

Meeting senior Kremlin envoys at their headquarters in Brussels, the NATO members said Moscow would have no veto on Ukraine or any other country joining the alliance, warning it would pay a high price if it invaded. ""Russia most of all will have to decide whether they really are about security, in which case they should engage, or whether this was all a pretext, and they may not even know yet,"" U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said. Putin's government has demanded the West to rule out accepting new members like Ukraine, Georgia or Finland on its eastern flank and has demanded limits on allied deployments in the former Soviet allies that joined NATO after the Cold War. Russia's massive troop build-up on Ukraine's borders has forced Washington to engage diplomatically — with bilateral security talks in Geneva on Monday, a NATO-Russia meeting on Wednesday and another planned at the OSCE in Vienna on Thursday. But the Western allies have received no promise that Russia will stand down its forces — which Moscow insists pose no threat to its already partially occupied neighbor — despite threatening massive economic sanctions if the Kremlin unleashes an invasion. Instead, the 30 member states invited the Russian envoys to return to Moscow and to advise Putin to join them for a series of confidence-building talks on limiting provocative military exercises, arms control and reciprocal limits on deploying missiles. ""Russia was not in a position to agree on that proposal. They didn't reject it either, but the Russian representatives made it clear that they needed some time to come back to NATO with an answer,"" alliance Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned: ""There are significant differences between NATO allies and Russia on these issues,"" he warned. Stoltenberg said it would be impossible for NATO members to agree to Moscow's core demands for a new security order in Europe, and in particular added that Russia would have no veto on Ukraine's right to eventually join the alliance. ""Ukraine as a sovereign nation... has the right to self-defense. Ukraine is not a threat to Russia,"" he said. ""It is Russia that is the aggressor. It is Russia that has used force and continues to use force against Ukraine. ""And then they're building up, with around 100,000 troops, artillery, armour, drones, tens of thousands of combat-ready troops and threatening rhetoric — that's the problem."" The West defends NATO's ""open-door policy"" towards potential future members, while Moscow is demanding a cast-iron guarantee that the alliance will not expand further towards its territory, seeing the westward tilt of one-time Warsaw Pact or Soviet allies as a threat. Before Wednesday, the NATO-Russia council had not met since 2019. NATO and Russia broke off practical cooperation in 2014 after Moscow occupied and annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea. Russia's diplomatic mission to the alliance was withdrawn in October last year after eight of its staff were expelled on allegations of espionage. But the former ambassador — now a deputy foreign minister — Alexander Grushko was back to confront Stoltenberg and Sherman, having earlier this week described the meeting as a ""moment of truth."" After the meeting, the senior U.S. diplomat said: ""Together, the United States and our NATO allies made clear we will not slam the door shut on NATO's open-door policy. ""NATO has never expanded through force or coercion or subversion. It is countries' sovereign choice to choose to come to NATO and say they want to join."" Just ahead of the talks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""The continuation of NATO's open-door policy and the further advancement of NATO towards our borders is precisely what, from our point of view, threatens us. ""This is exactly what we are asking not to continue through legally-binding guarantees."" The allies have threatened massive economic and financial sanctions against Moscow if its huge troop build-up on Ukraine's frontiers and in Russian-occupied Crimea turns into a new invasion. Peskov refused to be drawn on whether Russia could launch a military operation if denied. ""We would not like to throw around threats and ultimatums like American officials,"" he added. Russia has put intense pressure on Ukraine since 2014, after a revolution overthrew a government that had sided with the Kremlin against moving closer to Europe. Russia has seized and annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea and Moscow backs an insurgency in eastern Ukraine in which more than 13,000 people have died.",1,763,88.21,41.61,53.56,7.34,24.61,28.57,81.91,57.4,46,6.95,2.49,0,0.92,0,0.39,1.18,4.46,12.19,7.08,1.05,16.12,6.55,1.83,6.95,1.83,12.45,5.24,2.75,11.4,4.98,0.26,6.16,11.66,0.92,10.62,0.79,1.57,1.31,1.83,0.79,5.5,0,4.85,1.7,3.15,0.13,0,0.13,0,0.13,0,0,13.76,8.52,2.36,0.26,2.1,0,3.15,6.68,0,0,0,0.52,6.16,5.11,1.05,0,2.36,0,0.13,1.57,0.66,0,0.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.13,0.39,0.13,0.26,0,0,0,0,2.1,0.13,4.19,9.83,0.39,1.44,7.99,0.26,0,0.13,4.59,4.46,3.67,1.7,0.26,0,0.26,0,0,16.51,4.85,4.46,0,0,1.97,5.24

Senators Ready Sanctions if Russia Invades Ukraine,English,Russia,"U.S. senators from President Joe Biden's Democratic Party on Wednesday threatened major consequences if Russia invades Ukraine, including sanctions on President Vladimir Putin, Russian banks, and $500 million in fresh security aid to Kyiv. The introduction of legislation comes as the United States and its NATO allies hold talks with Russia and warn of high costs if the tens of thousands of troops on Ukraine's border advance. ""We are coming together to send a clear message — Putin need not collapse his entire economy nor does he need to sacrifice the lives of his own people in a futile attempt to rewrite the map of Europe,"" said Senator Bob Menendez, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said the legislation ""serves as a powerful deterrent by immediately and forcefully imposing crippling sanctions"" if Russia invades. The so-called Defending Ukraine Sovereignty Act would mandate U.S. sanctions on Putin and an array of top Russian officials as well as on at least three major financial institutions. It would also penalize services such as the SWIFT international banking network if they deal with sanctioned Russians. The act would provide $500 million in additional military aid to Ukraine to face off a Russian invasion, more than doubling what the Biden administration has provided in the past year. U.S. lawmakers across party lines take a hard line against Putin, who has denied plans to invade Ukraine but made security demands including guarantees that NATO will not expand into its neighbor, where a pro-Moscow insurgency has raged since 2014. But the Democratic-led legislation comes amid a feud in Congress as Republicans led by Senator Ted Cruz call a vote on a bill that would slap sanctions on businesses involved in Nord Stream 2, a gas pipeline built from Russia to Germany that has long been opposed by Ukraine which fears losing leverage. Democrats agreed to the vote in a deal in which Cruz lifted a months-long holdup of Biden's ambassadorial nominees, but the Biden administration has been pressing hard against his bill, saying it would put at risk an understanding with Germany to stop the pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine. Cruz's bill ""will undermine our efforts to deter Russia and remove leverage the United States and our allies and partners possess in this moment all to score political points at home,"" National Security Council spokeswoman Emily Horne said. She said the administration backed Menendez's bill as it would ""trigger severe costs to Russia’s economy,"" she said.",1,415,95.63,47.2,14.49,8.85,34.58,29.16,80.96,52.77,41.2,5.54,2.65,0,0.72,0,1.45,0.24,2.89,12.77,7.95,2.17,15.9,4.1,0.96,6.51,0.72,9.4,5.3,3.86,13.01,2.65,0.96,9.16,8.67,0.24,8.19,0.48,1.45,1.93,1.2,0.24,3.86,0,3.37,0.96,2.17,0.72,0,0.48,0.24,0.24,0,0,12.05,7.47,1.2,0,2.65,0,2.65,5.06,0,0,0.72,0.96,10.36,9.4,0.96,0,6.02,0.48,0.48,3.86,1.93,0,0.24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.48,0,0.24,0,0,0,0,1.93,0,2.65,9.16,0.24,1.2,8.19,0,0,0.48,1.93,3.37,2.89,0.72,0,0,0,0,0,12.29,4.34,3.13,0,0,1.45,3.37

Says No Progress With Russia as Long as  Gun to Ukraine Head  ",English,Russia,"U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned on Wednesday that Russia must ease pressure on Ukraine if it wants progress, as he renewed a warning of ""massive consequences"" for an invasion. Russia and the United States hold talks next week in Geneva after Moscow amassed tens of thousands of troops on the Ukrainian border and asked the West for guarantees against expanding the NATO alliance. If the talks are ""going to show real progress, that will require de-escalation,"" Blinken told a joint news conference with German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock. Pointing to Russia's hopes for progress in areas such as arms control, Blinken said, ""It's very hard to make actual progress in any of these areas in an atmosphere of escalation and threat with a gun pointed to Ukraine's head."" ""Russia should be in no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine would have massive consequences and severe costs in response,"" Blinken said. Baerbock, paying her first visit to Washington since taking office, agreed on the need for ""severe consequences"" if Russia attacks Ukraine. The United States and Germany have been at loggerheads for years over Nord Stream 2, which is set to open and ship Russian gas directly to Europe's largest economy. ""From our perspective, it's very hard to see gas flowing through that pipeline, to become operational, if Russia renews its aggression,"" Blinken said. Drawing criticism at home, President Joe Biden's administration has declined to impose sanctions over Nord Stream, saying it was virtually complete. But the administration last year reached an agreement in which Germany promised aid to Ukraine and warned Russia against using the pipeline for geopolitical advantage. Baerbock, asked if Germany was ready to cancel the pipeline, said only that the new government backed last year's agreement with the United States. The new government ""agreed that we take effective measures together with our European partners should Russia use energy as a weapon,"" she said.",1,319,94.37,43.76,11.84,3.82,26.58,29.47,78.37,55.8,40.44,6.27,1.88,0,0.94,0,0.94,0,4.39,11.29,6.27,0.94,16.61,5.02,1.25,5.64,0.31,13.79,5.96,2.82,7.21,2.19,1.88,3.45,11.29,0,11.29,0.31,2.82,2.19,2.19,1.88,3.45,0,4.7,1.25,3.45,0.94,0.31,0.63,0,0.63,0,0,11.6,8.15,0.94,0,1.57,0,5.02,3.45,0,0,0.63,0.31,6.9,5.64,1.25,0,3.76,0,0.31,2.51,0.94,0,0.63,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.94,0.63,0.94,0,0.31,0,0.31,2.19,0,3.45,8.15,0.94,0.63,5.64,0.63,0,0.63,4.7,4.7,2.82,2.19,0,0,0,0,0,16.93,4.39,5.64,0,0,2.19,4.7

S . it Has  No Intention to Invade Ukraine,English,Russia,"Russia told the United States at tense talks Monday that it had no plans to invade Ukraine, as the two sides agreed to more efforts to keep tensions from turning into a full-blown confrontation. After more than seven hours of negotiations in Geneva, the Russian and U.S. negotiators both offered to keep talking, though there was no sign of a major breakthrough. The high-stakes negotiations came amid fears of a Russian invasion of its pro-Western neighbor Ukraine, and with Moscow demanding wide-ranging concessions from Washington and its NATO allies. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said he had assured his U.S. counterpart, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, that those fears were unfounded. ""We explained to our colleagues that we have no plans, no intentions to 'attack' Ukraine... There is no reason to fear any escalation in this regard,"" he told reporters after the talks. Ryabkov said the United States ""took Russian proposals very seriously"" and that Moscow was ""for the continuation of dialogue."" Sherman said that she offered to make reciprocal moves with Russia on missiles and exercises, but renewed warnings of major costs if Moscow invaded Ukraine. She said the United States was ready to meet again, but that Russia had not offered assurances that it will pull back troops amassed near Ukraine. And she insisted that some of Russia's demands were ""simply non-starters,"" including a ban on NATO's further eastward expansion. ""We will not allow anyone to slam closed NATO's open-door policy,"" Sherman said. Monday's talks in Geneva launched a week of diplomacy between Russia and the West after Moscow amassed tens of thousands of troops at the Ukrainian border, drawing the United States into a Cold War-style stand-off. Both sides have set firm lines, with Washington warning that Moscow would face severe diplomatic and economic consequences from an invasion of Ukraine, and Russia demanding broad new security arrangements with the West. After Monday's talks, a meeting of the NATO-Russia Council will take place in Brussels on Wednesday, then the permanent council of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) will meet in Vienna on Thursday with the issue of Ukraine expected to dominate. Sherman renewed a call on Russia to pull back its estimated 100,000 troops. If Russia invades, she said, ""there will be significant costs and consequences, well beyond what they faced in 2014,"" when Moscow seized the Crimean peninsula and backed an insurgency in eastern Ukraine. Ryabkov denounced U.S. threats as ""attempts at blackmail and intimidation,"" but said ""I don't think the situation is hopeless."" Any direct military action by the United States or NATO in defense of Ukraine is extremely unlikely. But Western officials have warned Moscow would face significant economic and financial consequences if it invades, and could see NATO boost its presence and capacities near Russia's borders. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Monday that the alliance would be warning Russia of the ""severe costs"" of an invasion. He said he did not expect this week's talks to ""solve all the issues,"" but wanted to kickstart a diplomatic process. ""We are aiming for an agreement on a way forward, a process, a series of meetings,"" Stoltenberg said before talks with Ukraine's deputy prime minister in Brussels. Measures against Russia under consideration include sanctions on President Vladimir Putin's inner circle, cancelling Russia's controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany or, in the most drastic scenario, severing Russia's links to the world's banking system. Moscow insists it was deceived after the Cold War and understood that NATO would not expand eastward. Instead, the U.S.-led alliance welcomed most of the former Warsaw Pact countries and the three Baltic nations that were under Soviet rule. Russia has put intense pressure on Ukraine since 2014 after a revolution overthrew a government that had sided with the Kremlin against moving closer to Europe. Russia seized the Crimean peninsula and backs an insurgency in eastern Ukraine in which more than 13,000 people have died. The heaviest of the fighting has subsided but clashes continue almost daily, with the Ukrainian army saying Monday that two of its soldiers died after an explosion from an unknown device. The army also accused separatist forces of firing at its positions with grenade launchers, machineguns and small arms. In the muddy trenches on the frontline, there was little hope for diplomacy. ""I doubt that anything will change,"" 29-year-old soldier Mykhailo said as he walked through trenches in the town of Avdiivka, just north of the separatist stronghold city of Donetsk. ""Guarantees of not joining NATO will never stop"" Putin, Mykhailo said, adding: ""He wants to return the Soviet Union in version 2.0.""",1,771,91.35,37.09,40.98,10.06,24.09,28.92,81.32,57.85,44.49,6.61,2.46,0.26,0.65,0,1.43,0.13,4.15,13.88,7.78,1.56,15.43,4.93,2.33,6.36,1.56,12.19,5.19,3.63,8.3,2.2,0.65,5.45,10.25,0.91,9.08,1.04,1.43,1.04,1.82,0.78,3.5,0,4.41,1.69,2.72,0.78,0.13,0.65,0.39,0.13,0.13,0,12.71,8.56,1.04,0.52,1.3,0.26,4.54,4.15,0,0,0.52,0.91,6.1,5.06,1.04,0,3.37,0,0.13,2.46,0.91,0,0.65,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.26,0,0.39,0.52,0,0,0,0,1.3,0,2.98,11.93,0.52,1.95,8.69,0.13,0.13,0.65,3.89,5.84,1.82,2.08,0,0,0,0,0,18.29,5.58,5.19,0,0,1.95,5.58

S .- Russian Security Talks : What We Know - The Moscow Times,English,Russia,"Russia and the United States held more than seven hours of tense talks in Geneva on Monday regarding Moscow’s sweeping set of demands from Washington and its NATO allies on their presence in Ukraine and other former Soviet countries. Both sides noted there was no breakthrough, but vowed to continue diplomatic efforts to diffuse tensions. Here’s what they discussed: – Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said he had assured his U.S. counterpart, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, that the fears of a Russian invasion of its pro-Western neighbor Ukraine were unfounded. – Sherman said Russia offered no proof it would not invade, nor any explanation for why it has deployed some 100,000 troops towards the Ukrainian border. – Sherman threatened sanctions on key Russian financial institutions, export controls targeting key industries, NATO enhancement and more security assistance to Kyiv if Russia invades Ukraine. – Ryabkov denounced the U.S. threats as ""attempts at blackmail and intimidation.” But he added: ""I don't think the situation is hopeless."" – Ryabkov sought “ironclad, legally binding” guarantees that Ukraine as well as the ex-Soviet republic of Georgia would never join the U.S.-led military bloc, saying the issue “is an absolute imperative” to Russia. – Sherman insisted that the demand is a ""non-starter,” saying “we will not allow anyone to slam closed NATO's open-door policy.” – Sherman offered reciprocal moves with Russia on de-escalation on missile placements and exercises. – Ryabkov reiterated Russia’s warning of a “military response through means at our discretion” if NATO deployed U.S. offensive weapons in Europe. “That will inevitably, unavoidably damage security of the U.S. and its European allies,” the AP quoted him as saying. – Ryabkov made clear that Russia was not interested in discussing the defunct INF Treaty, which had banned both sides from stationing short- and intermediate-range, land-based missiles in Europe, without the demands it has laid out in front of the U.S. and NATO. – Monday's talks in Geneva launched a week of “Strategic Security Dialogue” diplomacy between Russia and the West after Moscow's troop movements near Ukraine triggered a Cold War-style standoff. – A meeting of the NATO-Russia Council will take place in Brussels on Wednesday, then the permanent council of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) will meet in Vienna on Thursday with the issue of Ukraine expected to dominate. – The Kremlin called Monday's talks between the United States a ""positive"" start to continued dialogue, but noted that ""this is not a process for the sake of process... what's important here is the result. There is nothing to say yet about the result."" – Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko called the talks a ""moment of truth"" in Russia-NATO relations. ""Our expectations are entirely realistic and we hope that this will be a serious, deep conversation on key, fundamental problems of European security,"" Grushko said, referring to the talks in Brussels.

Meeting senior Kremlin envoys at their headquarters in Brussels, the NATO members said Moscow would have no veto on Ukraine or any other country joining the alliance, warning it would pay a high price if it invaded. ""Russia most of all will have to decide whether they really are about security, in which case they should engage, or whether this was all a pretext, and they may not even know yet,"" U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said.

The military’s Western Military District said the motorized rifle drills will involve T-72B3 main battle tanks and BMP-2 infantry fighting vehicles. The drills stretch across western Russia’s Voronezh, Belgorod, Bryansk and Smolensk regions. Late in December, Russia completed 10,000-troop drills across southern regions that included Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014. Russia’s announcement Tuesday — marking its second live fire exercises near Ukrainian borders in a month — came one day after Russian and U.S. diplomats held strategic security talks to try to de-escalate tensions. One of the key de-escalation issues offered by Washington was mutually limiting military exercises and deploying missiles in Europe. The U.S. State Department on Tuesday said Russia’s exercises go “in exactly the opposite direction” of de-escalation. The West has for months raised alarm over Russian military buildup near Ukraine and fears of a Russian invasion of its ally. Moscow denies planning an invasion and says moving troops and holding military drills within its borders is its right. The U.S. State Department said Russia offered no proof it would not invade or any explanation for why it has deployed some 100,000 troops toward the Ukrainian border. “These kind of deployments, 100,000 troops out of barracks and on the Ukrainian border, are extremely expensive,” Under Secretary of State Victoria Nuland said during Tuesday’s briefing. “As is the deployment of this kind of weaponry in the cold winter.” The Ukrainian president’s spokesman welcomed ""the intent and efforts of the United States and Russia, and NATO and Russia to reduce tensions and resolve all mutual issues at the negotiating table."" Monday’s negotiations in Geneva offered no breakthrough, with the next round of dialogue moving to NATO headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday.

",English,Russia,"Russia ruled out Sunday any concession at talks with the United States on soaring tensions over Ukraine, as Moscow, facing strong pressure to pull back troops, seeks a wide-ranging new security arrangement with the West. Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told Russian news agencies ahead of his talks in Geneva the Kremlin was ""disappointed"" with signals coming from Washington and from Brussels, where NATO and the European Union are based. The high-level discussions kick off a week of diplomacy in which Russia will meet with NATO and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), as the United States tries to assure European allies they will not be sidelined. Since late last year, Russia has amassed tens of thousands of troops at the Ukrainian border and demanded guarantees that NATO will not expand further eastward. The Kremlin is insisting NATO must never grant membership to ex-Soviet Ukraine, which is pushing to join. The United States, to be represented by Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, agreed to talks even though it made plain that many of Moscow's proposals are non-starters. Originally scheduled to start on Monday, Sherman is now due to have a working dinner with Ryabkov on Sunday evening, said a State Department spokesperson. Russia's Foreign Ministry posted footage of Ryabkov's plane arriving in Geneva. ""We will not agree to any concession. That is completely excluded,"" Ryabkov said before departing. ""We are disappointed with the signals coming in the last few days from Washington but also from Brussels."" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, dismissing Moscow's demands as ""gaslighting"", has insisted that talks will yield no progress so long as Russia has a ""gun to Ukraine's head."" ""We're prepared to respond forcefully to further Russian aggression. But a diplomatic solution is still possible and preferable if Russia chooses it,"" Blinken said Friday. Russian President Vladimir Putin met his US counterpart Joe Biden in Geneva in June and agreed on regular ""stability"" talks between Sherman and Ryabkov. In two phone calls to Putin, Biden has warned of severe consequences if Russia invades Ukraine. Measures under consideration include sanctions on Putin's inner circle, cancelling Russia's controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany or, in the most drastic scenario, severing Russia's links to the world's banking system. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, warned that Washington would also send more troops to eastern NATO members such as Poland and the Baltic states if Russia invaded Ukraine. Europeans have showed solidarity, with EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell visiting the frontline in Ukraine, although some nations are expected to hesitate at the strongest measures. ""Whatever the solution, Europe has to be involved,"" EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said. Russia insists it was deceived after the Cold War and understood that NATO would not expand. Instead, the U.S.-led alliance welcomed most of the former Warsaw Pact countries and the three Baltic nations that were under Soviet rule. Russia has put intense pressure on Ukraine since 2014 after a revolution overthrew a government that had sided with the Kremlin against moving closer to Europe. Russia seized the Crimean peninsula and backs an insurgency in eastern Ukraine in which more than 13,000 people have died. At a time when Russia is also intervening to shore up allies facing popular uprisings in Belarus and Kazakhstan, Moscow has insisted it wants concrete progress in talks with Washington. Putin's foreign policy adviser Yury Ushakov warned after the call with Biden that the United States would make a ""colossal mistake"" if it went ahead with sanctions. ""It is very likely that we will encounter the reticence of our U.S. and NATO colleagues to really perceive what we need,"" Ryabkov said Sunday. In spite ""of the threats that are constantly formulated against us ... we wil make no concession,"" he said, adding it would ""amount to acting against the interests of our seccurity."" NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg, meeting foreign ministers of the alliance on Friday, said there remained real risks of a Russian invasion. But John Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, described the Russian troop build-up as a ""gigantic bluff"" by Putin to seek a negotiated agreement. ""They are trying to see if the Biden administration or Europe will blink,"" said Herbst, now at the Atlantic Council think tank. ""As long as the Biden administration remains at least as strong as it is now,"" he said, ""it probably is enough to keep Putin from striking large into Ukraine, but I don't rule out something smaller."" Matthew Rojansky, director of the Kennan Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, said the Geneva talks were more about preventing the Ukraine crisis from accelerating than reaching a major deal.",1,787,91.77,46.83,34.22,13.43,23.15,29.22,77.76,57.18,43.33,5.46,2.16,0.13,1.27,0,0.51,0.25,3.3,11.18,6.99,0.76,16.39,5.97,2.8,6.35,1.02,13.85,5.72,2.92,7.62,3.05,0.89,3.68,10.17,0.38,9.66,1.02,1.4,1.27,1.78,1.02,3.68,0,3.18,1.27,1.91,0.51,0,0.51,0,0.25,0.25,0,11.31,6.99,0.64,0.25,0.51,0.13,4.45,4.7,0,0,0,0.51,7.37,5.97,1.27,0.13,3.05,0,0,3.05,0.13,0,0.38,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.13,0.13,0.38,0.13,0.13,0,0.13,0,0,1.4,0.13,3.43,9.15,0.76,1.65,6.48,0.25,0,0.25,4.7,3.94,4.45,2.16,0.13,0,0.13,0,0,17.92,5.84,5.34,0,0,1.65,5.08

Putin delivered his annual holiday greetings hours after speaking with U.S. President Joe Biden, who warned the Russian leader of a “decisive” response to any invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin chief meanwhile cautioned Biden that sanctions would be a “colossal mistake” and lead to a collapse in Russian-U.S. relations. Pandemic toll Russia recorded more than 115,000 excess deaths during November 2021 according to official statistics published Thursday — a new record high since the start of the pandemic. The number takes Russia’s overall excess death count since the start of the pandemic to 929,000, according to The Moscow Times’ analysis. Calculations based on official statistics for January-November and preliminary data for December say Russia’s Covid-19 death toll is the second-highest in the world behind the United States. Foreign agents Russia on Thursday added members of the Pussy Riot protest group Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Nika Nikulshina, prominent satirist Viktor Shenderovich, independent journalist Taisiya Bekbulatova and former Kremlin advisor Marat Gelman to its registry of “foreign agents.” The Justice Ministry's registry now includes more than 100 entities and individuals, most of which were added in 2021 Tsirkon test The Russian Navy’s Northern Fleet said on Friday that it had carried out a 10th overall test of the Tsirkon hypersonic cruise missile from a frigate. The Russian military also test-fired the Tsirkon from a submarine twice during the testing phase, the Northern Fleet added. Fatal crash Five people died and 21 were injured in a bus accident near the village of Voslebovo in the Ryazan region south of Moscow on Sunday, Russian authorities said. The Federal Road Traffic Inspection agency published photographs of the badly damaged coach, which hit a pillar under a railway bridge. The front of the bus appeared to be entirely crushed. A website belonging to the Russian Interior Ministry said the driver could have fallen asleep behind the wheel.

According to the Levada Center pollster, 44% of Russian respondents said they expected the political situation to worsen in the coming months. Likewise, 49% said they expect the same for Russia’s economy. Only 18% and 16%, respectively, said they expected Russia’s political and economic life to improve in 2022. More than half of the respondents expressed skepticism toward the Russian government’s ability to improve the overall domestic situation, compared with two out of five who expressed confidence. When asked to assess Russia’s current political climate — which has seen an unprecedented crackdown on the non-systemic opposition over the past year — 47% of respondents called it “tense” and 12% called it “explosive.” Only 7% called the political situation “safe” and 32% called it “calm,” according to Levada. The independent polling agency’s results reflect the general mood among Russians as Moscow seeks to wrangle security concessions from the United States and NATO amid a post-Cold War freeze in relations. The U.S. warns of an imminent Russian invasion of Ukraine and has threatened tough sanctions, including on key Russian industries, in response. While Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine led to a surge in domestic approval for the country's leadership, it also sparked harsh sanctions from the West.

The high-stakes negotiations come amid fears of a Russian invasion of its pro-Western neighbor Ukraine, and with Moscow demanding wide-ranging concessions from Washington and its NATO allies. Monday's talks in Geneva launch a week of diplomacy between Russia and the West after Moscow amassed tens of thousands of troops at the Ukrainian border, drawing the United States into a Cold War-style stand-off. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov opened their meeting at the U.S. mission in Geneva at 8:55 a.m. (07:55 GMT). A convoy of black vehicles with Russian diplomatic plates had arrived shortly before, and was ushered through the large iron gates under a billowing U.S. flag. The two diplomats had already met informally in the Swiss city on Sunday evening, with Ryabkov afterwards telling Russian news agencies the first meeting had been ""difficult."" State news agency RIA Novosti on Monday quoted Ryabkov saying he feared Washington was not taking seriously Moscow's demand of an end to NATO's eastward expansion. Pointing to a 2008 promise by NATO to consider membership for Ukraine and others, Ryabkov said: ""Are they ready to give legal guarantees that this country, as well as other countries... will not join NATO?"" ""I have a rather pessimistic forecast in this regard."" Sherman said on Twitter that the talks were underway but there would be little progress without others at the table. ""The U.S. will listen to Russia's concerns and share our own, but we have been clear we will not discuss European security without our allies and partners,"" she said. Sherman in the talks on Sunday had stressed ""the freedom of sovereign nations to choose their own alliances,"" the State Department said. In the muddy trenches on the frontline in Ukraine, where Kyiv's forces have been battling pro-Russian fighters since 2014, there was little hope for diplomacy. ""I doubt that anything will change,"" 29-year-old soldier Mykhailo said as he walked through trenches in the town of Avdiivka, just north of the separatist stronghold city of Donetsk. ""Guarantees of not joining NATO will never stop"" Russian President Vladimir Putin, Mykhailo said, adding: ""He wants to return the Soviet Union in version 2.0."" Both sides have set firm lines, with Washington warning that Moscow would face severe diplomatic and economic consequences from an invasion of Ukraine, and Russia demanding wide-ranging new security arrangements with the West. After Monday's talks, a meeting of the NATO-Russia Council will take place in Brussels on Wednesday, then the permanent council of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) will meet in Vienna on Thursday with the issue of Ukraine expected to dominate. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken stressed Sunday that Russia had to choose between dialogue and confrontation, warning on CNN that there would be ""massive consequences for Russia if it renews its aggression on Ukraine."" Blinken warned that any positive outcome from the talks would rely in part on Russia's willingness to stand down from its aggressive posture, which he likened to ""an atmosphere of escalation with a gun to Ukraine's head."" Any direct military action by the United States or NATO in defense of Ukraine is extremely unlikely. But Western officials have warned Moscow would face significant economic and financial consequences if it invades, and could see NATO boost its presence and capacities near Russia's borders. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Monday that the alliance would be warning Russia of the ""severe costs"" of an invasion. He said he did not expect this week's talks to ""solve all the issues,"" but wanted to kickstart a diplomatic process. ""We are aiming for an agreement on a way forward, a process, a series of meetings,"" Stoltenberg said before talks with Ukraine's deputy prime minister in Brussels. Measures against Russia under consideration include sanctions on Putin's inner circle, canceling Russia's controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany or, in the most drastic scenario, severing Russia's links to the world's banking system.

Here’s what we know about the NATO-Russia Council talks in Brussels: ‘No positive agenda’ – NATO rejected Russia's demand for a new security settlement in Europe, challenging President Vladimir Putin to withdraw troops deployed near Ukraine and join talks on reducing the threat of open conflict. – The Western allies received no promise that Russia will stand down its forces — which Moscow insists pose no threat to its already partially occupied neighbor — despite the threat of economic sanctions. – Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko said the “frank, direct, deep, intense” talks revealed “a large number of differences on fundamental issues.” – He said that Russia and NATO had no ""positive agenda — none at all"" and warned that the continued deterioration could lead to the ""most unpredictable and most dire consequences for European security.” Arms control – Grushko told reporters that Russia was ready for dialogue on not deploying intermediate-range missiles in Europe, mutual limits on military exercises and ways to prevent accidental encounters. – He pointed out that the confidence-building measures are included in Russia’s sweeping list of demands and proposals that forced Western allies to meet Russian envoys this week. – “The Russian side has repeatedly offered the alliance to take measures to de-escalate the situation. The Russian initiatives have been ignored by [NATO’s] side. This creates conditions for incidents and conflicts and undermines the foundations of security,"" the Defense Ministry said in a statement published by the state-run RIA Novosti news agency. Ukraine – Grushko called on NATO to stop sending military aid and arms supplies to Kyiv to de-escalate the current tensions. He maintained that Moscow's proposals, where a ban on Ukraine’s future NATO membership is a central tenet, could in fact improve security of both Russia and NATO members. – In response to NATO’s rejection of Russia’s demand to veto Ukraine’s membership aspirations, Grushko said that “the freedom to choose ways of ensuring one’s security mustn’t be implemented in a way that infringes on legitimate security interests of others.” Future talks – NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said “both Russia and NATO allies expressed the need to resume dialogue and to explore a schedule of future meetings.” – He said the U.S.-led alliance was ready to reopen its missions in Moscow four months after Russia suspended them in retaliation to NATO’s expulsion of Russian envoys over spying accusations. Putin invite – NATO invited the Russian envoys to return to Moscow and to advise Putin to join them for a series of confidence-building talks on limiting provocative military exercises, arms control and reciprocal limits on deploying missiles. – Stoltenberg said Russia’s envoys did not reject the offer. “Russia was not in a position to agree on that proposal…, but the Russian representatives made it clear that they needed some time to come back to NATO with an answer.” AFP contributed reporting.",1,502,96.6,44.78,13.14,17.9,26.42,32.87,79.48,53.78,39.84,5.98,1.59,0,0.2,0,0.8,0.6,4.38,13.35,7.17,0.6,16.14,3.39,0.8,3.78,1.79,10.16,5.58,4.38,8.96,2.59,1.39,5.18,8.17,1.2,6.77,1,1.79,1.39,0,0.2,1.79,0,4.58,2.19,2.39,0.2,0,0.2,0,0.2,0,0,14.94,11.55,2.39,0,1.99,0.4,5.38,4.18,0,0,0,0.8,5.78,3.98,1.79,0,2.99,0,0.4,2.39,0.2,0,0.6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.6,0.2,0.4,0,0,0,0,2.59,0.8,3.78,9.16,1.2,0.8,7.17,0.2,0,0.2,3.39,5.18,2.59,1.79,0.2,0,0.2,0,0,15.34,4.38,2.19,0,0,2.99,5.78

Russia’s military build-up on the Ukrainian border has set the world on edge, raising fears of an invasion. In neighboring Belarus, the Kremlin has moved closer to fully-fledged integration with the country, whose embattled strongman President Alexander Lukashenko looks increasingly isolated from the West. Looking west, the jailing of Kremlin-critic Alexei Navalny further strained relations with Europe, while across the Atlantic, the election of Joe Biden fundamentally changed the course of American foreign policy toward Russia. Russia also tried to extend its global footprint, by cooperating with post-coup Myanmar and Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. And as the world continued to struggle with the coronavirus pandemic, Russia attempted to boost its global image through “vaccine diplomacy,” but inconsistent vaccine production and a murky middle-man selling vaccines in the developing world ultimately led to a string of scandals that did Russia’s reputation more harm than good. What does Russia hope to achieve in 2022? The Moscow Times asked 10 leading experts in Russian foreign policy to give their predictions for the coming year. Russia-China relations will deepen in 2022 Alexander Gabuev, senior fellow and chair of the Russia in Asia-Pacific Program at the Carnegie Moscow Center Two years of the pandemic have shown the resilience of Russia-China ties. In 2021, trade volume grew to nearly $140 billion, setting another historic record. This figure reflects not only high commodities prices this year, but also increased shipments of natural gas via the “Power of Siberia” pipeline and growth in volumes of Russian coal exports to China. In 2022 this trend is likely to continue, although exact trade volumes will be subject to volatile global prices. As China shifts away from domestic coal to cleaner fuels like gas, and Russia seeks to monetize its natural resources, Moscow and Beijing might find more joint projects. Some of them will be unveiled during Vladimir Putin’s trip to Beijing in February, with a new contract for the “Power of Siberia 2” gas pipeline as the crown jewel. The political environment is also benevolent to the further deepening of China-Russia ties. Moscow’s conflict with the West is not going away, as demonstrated by recent events in Ukraine, raising the prospect of more U.S. and EU sanctions against Russia. Beijing’s confrontation with the U.S. is also here to stay, even if the White House gets distracted by events in Europe or elsewhere. Despite some predictions, China-Russia entente is far from its peak, and 2022 is likely to serve as another testament to this. Keeping the Middle East “stable in its instability” Mariana Belenskaya, Middle East correspondent for the Russian daily Kommersant ​​It seems that Russian foreign policy is no longer focused on the Middle East, as it was for several years after the start of the military campaign in Syria. Russia is now moving along a familiar path — the situation is “stable in its instability” but Moscow has restored its authority in the region, established ties and assigned roles. The general task for next year is to increase trade with the countries of the region — including by expanding the grain market — and maintaining interest in Russian weapons. Syria, which will remain Russia’s zone of responsibility for many years to come, is still a separate set of issues. It is important that the pacified territories do not once again turn into hotbeds of confrontation and that no global powers initiate new operations in the country. In addition, Russia hopes that Syria will gradually emerge from its international isolation. For its part, Moscow will continue trying to rebuild Syria’s infrastructure, at least to the extent that it can do so alone. Russia might need to pay close attention to Libya, where it remains unclear how events will develop. Moscow maintains close contact with all the parties in the Libyan conflict but does not seek a central role in resolving the problems there — at least for as long as the situation does not become critical. Two regional problems will require particular attention next year — the “Iranian nuclear dossier” and Afghanistan. The latter has become more strongly linked to the Middle East now that Turkey and Qatar have taken an interest in it. As for Iran, Moscow will do everything in its power to bring all parties back to the Iran nuclear deal — the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action — as it existed prior to Washington’s withdrawal from it in 2018. Indeed, the answer to the question of whether a Nuclear Deal 2.0 will appear and how it will look largely depends on how events will transpire in the Middle East and what role each party in the region will play. Peace in Ukraine is a victory in itself Andrei Kortunov, director-general of the Russian International Affairs Council It is hard to envisage a breakthrough or even significant progress in relations between Russia and Ukraine in 2022. The definition of success would be the ability of the sides to avoid direct military confrontation in Donbass, in the Azov Sea or along the Russian-Ukrainian border. The current political dynamic between Kiev and in Moscow is not conducive to the flexibility needed to move ahead with the implementation of the Minsk Agreements. At the same time, the change of government in Germany and the forthcoming presidential election in France make it very hard for the European members of the Normandy process to exercise the leadership needed to overcome the current stalemate. One could expect the Biden administration to become a more active player in the situation around Ukraine in 2022, but the odds are that White House attention will be focused on ongoing U.S.-China rivalry and the Ukrainian crisis will remain a relatively low priority for Washington. Still, de-escalation is possible, as well as a new Russian-Ukrainian agreement for gas transit. If these modest goals are achieved in 2022, we might see less hostile and belligerent rhetoric coming out of Moscow and Kiev. Further uneasy integration with Lukashenko in Belarus Artyom Shraibman, Belarussian journalist and political commentator for the Carnegie Moscow Center Russia's strategic goals in Belarus have remained unchanged for many years. Moscow, at minimum, wants to prevent the rapprochement of Minsk with the West, and at maximum, to strengthen its own influence in Belarus, which could outlive Alexander Lukashenko. Further institutionalization of such dependence will be the plan for 2022. This includes promoting bilateral integration within the Union State, increasing Russian military presence in Belarus, and “helping” Minsk to reorient its trade flows toward Russia in response to Western sanctions. Not all of those ambitions will necessarily materialize, as Lukashenko retains some bargaining power. For several years now, Moscow has been approaching financial support for Lukashenka conservatively. The volume of indirect subsidies, discounts on gas and oil and loans are either decreasing or not growing. The Kremlin gives Lukashenko as much as is necessary to keep his regime afloat, but the idea of more generous investment in Belarus has long been unpopular in Moscow. At the same time, one should not expect Putin to exert tough pressure on Lukashenko in order to speed up the transfer of power in Belarus. At best, the Kremlin might be ready to push the friendly regime toward controlled transformation, but Russians will not actively undermine Lukashenko’s rule. Moscow's long-standing problem with Belarus is the lack of reliable alternatives to Lukashenko. Despite Biden-Putin respect, Ukraine means a bumpy ride in relations with America Vladimir Frolov, political columnist and former Russian diplomat In 2022, the U.S. and Russia will test the resilience of the respectful adversarial relationship they have transitioned to after the Geneva summit last June. “The spirit of Geneva” has helped keep confrontation at an acceptable level through dialogue on strategic stability and cyber threats and with regular interaction between national security advisors. The presidential talks have demonstrated grudging respect and an ability to communicate grievances and threats clearly, but calmly, while opening new avenues for dialogue. Washington dangles inconclusive talks to curb Russian unpredictability, while Moscow views engaging with Biden as the best way to address Russia’s long-ignored concerns without changing course. There is even a rare U.S.-Russia mind-meld over the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) Iran nuclear deal negotiations, with Iran’s intransigence providing the incentives. Disagreements, however, will remain. The stand-off over bilateral diplomatic presence has degenerated into the grotesque, with spy agencies unable to agree on rules for acceptable espionage activity. Resolving the impasse will require Moscow to remove its designation of the U.S. as a “hostile power.” Ukraine, NATO enlargement and Russia’s rightful place in the European security order will remain the key battlegrounds in 2022. Moscow harbors great expectations after Biden’s promise to discuss Russia’s concerns over NATO enlargement “among the five major NATO allies” signaling acceptance of Moscow’s preferred format on European security. In Ukraine, Russia’s demands have moved beyond the implementation of the Minsk agreements and are now in “Finlandization territory.” Moscow’s insistence on legally binding guarantees of the definitive end to NATO enlargement in the former Soviet Union has narrowed the scope for face-saving diplomacy. Biden will have a short time frame in 2022 to negotiate an acceptable accommodation with Putin on Ukraine and European security. Russia’s posture is unlikely to change before significant diplomatic progress towards meeting Moscow’s objectives. It will be a rough ride. Crucial elections in Latin America could tilt the balance of power in Russia’s favor Vladimir Rouvinski, professor at Icesi University in Colombia In 2021, Russia managed to position itself as one of the major suppliers of the Covid-19 vaccine to the region, although mainly supporting countries with friendly relations to Moscow Meanwhile, key Russia ally President Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela, not only survived 2021 but also started strengthening his position in the region thanks to a new left-wing wave on the continent. In the coming year, Russia will be closely watching several important presidential elections, including Colombia, where a left-wing candidate is projected to be the likely winner. In Brazil, the very popular left-wing former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is expected to announce his bid for the presidency in early 2022. Wins for both left-wing candidates will dramatically change the Latin American political map and open new opportunities for Moscow to strengthen its ties in the Western Hemisphere. However, Russia also faces challenges. One of them is the shortage of tangible resources to support its allies in this part of the world. This is most evident in Cuba, where the situation is deteriorating rapidly and Moscow has so far provided minimal aid. The continuous tensions with Washington over Ukraine may incentivize reciprocity-driven Russia to pay more attention to Cuba, located just 129 kilometers (80 miles) from the U.S border. No easy answers in Europe Anton Barbashin, editorial director of Riddle Russia It is almost impossible, looking at the end of 2021, to see a bright future for EU-Russia relations in 2022. The best case scenario is that they won’t get much worse. We can point to three major themes that will define this relationship next year — Ukraine, Belarus and the future of gas. In each of these cases the EU’s goal is to minimize damage, while Russia will undoubtedly be ready to up the risk-taking, assuming the EU will be the first to blink. The most heated and potentially most devastating is the tension over Ukraine and the role of NATO in European security. While Moscow certainly blames Paris and Berlin for failing to press Minsk II and is now betting on Washington, it will be the EU that will have to pick up what’s left after the likely fallout. The blow might be softened by prompt Nord Stream 2 certification, but as of now it looks like stable gas prices are not in the basic scenario for 2022. Peaceful or not, 2022 will not be relaxing. Will the Arctic remain the sole region of cooperation in 2022? Elizabeth Buchanan, lecturer in strategic studies with Deakin University at the Australian War College Will 2022 mark the end of the Arctic’s “low tension” post-Cold War run or will the Arctic remain “isolated” from Russian-Western strategic tensions elsewhere? Pundits worldwide will no doubt keep a watchful eye on any potential spillover from Russia’s current Ukraine trajectory into the Arctic. Since 2014, Russian-Western ties in the Arctic have remained largely cooperative, indeed even collaborative via multilateral vehicles like the Arctic Council. Russia knows that the future economic resource base of the country does not rest on its Eastern European doorstep, but on its Arctic frontier. Plunging the Russian Arctic Zone into conflict is therefore not part of Russia’s strategic playbook. Working to silo the Arctic from tensions far beyond the region will remain a lynchpin of Kremlin security planning and outlook. The real geopolitical and strategic gains and achievements for Moscow in the Arctic will remain nested in Russia’s bilateral energy engagements. In 2022, I expect an enhanced diversification strategy with regard to Russia’s economic partners and stakeholders in its various Arctic energy ventures. Bilateral Arctic ties with India will be central to offsetting any Russian overreliance on Chinese capital. Russia will try to gain from the Taliban’s threat in Central Asia Temur Umarov, research consultant at Carnegie Moscow Center focusing on Central Asia In 2022, security concerns in Afghanistan will continue to be the priority for Moscow in Central Asia. Russia will see a window of opportunity to regain its reputation — which is being challenged by China — as the only reliable security guarantor in Central Asia against the uncertainties that the Taliban regime brings. This means that in the upcoming year Russia will intensify its cooperation with the security agencies in Central Asian nations. Russia will also be hoping to push through its integration projects with countries previously skeptical of joining. Uzbekistan, for instance, is now seriously considering joining the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union. Overall, Russia’s leadership will want to see a stable and safe Central Asia in the next several years. The closer we move toward 2024 presidential elections, the less energy the Kremlin will have for anything other than its domestic issues. Moscow will therefore try its best to help the political leaders in Central Asia to become stronger and more stable. However, this is not going to be an easy task, especially in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. More than symbolism at the 2022 Russia-Africa Summit Andrey Maslov, head of the Center for African Studies at Moscow's Higher School of Economics, with researcher for Intexpertise LLC Sviridov Vsevolod The volume of Russian-African trade increased this year for the first time since 2018, diversifying both geographically and in the range of goods traded. Shipments of railway equipment, fertilizers, pipes, high-tech equipment and aluminum are growing and work continues on institutionalizing the interaction between Russia and the African Union. The second Russia-Africa Summit is planned for 2022. In February it will be announced where and when it will be held — most likely in Russia in November — and in which format. Preparations for the second summit will shape the Russian-African agenda, visits will become more frequent and Africa will receive greater coverage in Russian media. Instead of measuring the success of the summit by how many African leaders attended, as happened in 2019, the parties will finally give greater attention to the substance of the agenda, which is already under development. Russia will try to increase its presence in Africa while avoiding direct confrontation with other non-regional players. A number of conflicts are also causing alarm, primarily those in Ethiopia and in Mali, from which France and the EU are withdrawing their troops. In 2022, Russia will try in various ways to play a stabilizing role for Africa and assist in confronting the main challenges it faces — epidemics, the spread of extremism and conflicts, and hunger. A dialogue will also begin on Africa formulating its own climate agenda. Africa is beginning to understand that it does not need a European-style green agenda and will demand compensation from the main polluting countries for the damage the climatic changes have caused to the ecosystems of African countries. Russia is likely to support these demands.",1,2686,95.99,27.84,53.59,39.79,24.2,31.09,79.08,57.86,45.31,3.95,0.56,0.04,0.11,0.04,0.11,0.22,3.39,13.1,8.45,2.01,17.42,6.44,2.94,5.17,0.86,10.2,8.23,3.46,6.66,1.23,2.08,3.46,8.75,0.3,8.41,1.45,0.93,0.86,1.68,0.48,3.09,0,4.69,3.02,1.68,0.82,0.3,0.52,0.15,0.34,0,0,5.25,3.28,1.01,0.19,0.82,0.11,0.67,1.6,0,0.04,0,0.11,4.36,2.57,1.6,0.19,3.43,0.26,0.15,2.23,0.93,0.11,0.6,0.37,0.34,0,0,0,0,0.04,0.04,0.48,0.19,0.3,0.07,0,0,0.45,0.74,0.04,3.43,12.62,0.56,1.04,10.13,0.78,0,0.37,3.83,1.19,3.54,3.76,0.07,0.04,0.04,0,0,12.96,4.54,4.36,0.11,0,1.23,2.72

Russia’s lead negotiator said he saw “no reason” to renew talks anytime soon, adding that the U.S. had shown no flexibility regarding Moscow’s demands to veto Ukrainian membership in the NATO alliance and roll back NATO’s troop and equipment deployments in central and eastern Europe. The ruble fell by almost 3% against the U.S. dollar following the comments, while Russia’s leading stock market lost more than 4% in ruble terms. The Russian currency was trading at 76.4 against the U.S. dollar on Thursday evening in Moscow, and had fallen to 87.6 against the euro. Russia’s dollar-denominated stock market, the RTS index, lost 6% with commodities companies among the biggest fallers. “The market has had its head in the sand about Russia-related geopolitical risks and is just waking up now,” said emerging markets bond trader Timothy Ash in a note to clients. Russian markets have been relatively quiet since the start of the year, despite the precarious security situation and comments from all sides that there is a serious risk of military escalation. Traders “may be realizing that Moscow is just going through the motions on the diplomatic front now but it is set on war,” Ash added. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said in an interview with the Russian-language channel RTVI that he was awaiting a substantive response from the West to draft treaties presented by Moscow at the end of last year before Moscow would contemplate another round of talks. “Another deterioration in the geopolitical situation has increased country risks and the corresponding discount in ruble assets,” said Dmitry Babin, stock market expert with Moscow-based brokerage BCS Investments. “Against this backdrop, the decline is likely to continue, at least in the short-term.” Also weighing on market sentiment Thursday was a draft U.S. bill outlining hard-hitting sanctions on the Russian economy that would result from Moscow taking further military steps against Ukraine. Moscow has hit back at Washington’s plans and ruled out calls to de-escalate the situation Thursday following the failure of high-level diplomatic talks earlier in the week. “Russia is not even ready to discuss the U.S.’ absolutely unacceptable demand for Russian troops to return to their barracks,” Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said, referring to calls from the U.S. for Moscow to withdraw some of the 100,000 troops it has stationed near the border with Ukraine. Talks between Moscow, Washington and NATO in Europe this week have failed to move the sides closer to a resolution of what Moscow has called “large and fundamental differences.” Moscow wants legal guarantees that NATO will never admit Ukraine as a member and has called for troop deployments across the alliance to be rolled back to 1997 positions, before the bloc expanded into eastern Europe. The U.S. has branded the proposals a “non-starter,” and high-level talks in Geneva and Brussels this week have not managed to bring the sides closer together.

The point is that they are talking, but are they speaking the same language? The mood music out of Geneva was as good as could have been expected in that the door is still open; although it is still unclear if anything will come through it. Moscow’s point man, First Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, said that “the conversation was difficult, long, very professional, deep, concrete, without attempts to embellish anything, to avoid any sharp corners,” but he allowed that “the American side took the Russian proposals very seriously.” On the specific issue of Ukraine, he said “we explained to our colleagues that we have no plans, no intentions, to ‘attack’ Ukraine … There is no reason to fear any escalation in this regard.” His U.S. counterpart, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, likewise characterized the talks as “serious” and “business-like,” but added “it is on Russia to de-escalate tensions,” which is at once true and yet also at the root of the problem. In part, this is about a fundamental disconnect between how Russia and the West see the situation. Washington wants to make this an issue of broader “strategic stability,” a route back into discussions about arms control and nuclear policy. Moscow is not specifically against this, but believes that talking about strategic stability in the present situation is like getting involved in comparison-shopping for burglar alarms when an intruder is already prising open the windows to your bedroom. It is an important but secondary and longer-term issue, to be resolved later, compared with an immediate threat from NATO. The West does not seem to be able to accept that — however nonsensical it may seem — the old men in the Kremlin truly do believe that NATO poses a threat, not necessarily in conventional military terms, but as a hostile alliance committed to constraining and even undermining Russia. This, after all, speaks to the arguably even more important point of the equally fundamental contrast between how the two sides feel about the situation and the talks. To Washington, these are pragmatic crisis talks to defuse a dangerous situation generated by the Kremlin’s unrealistic fears and ambitions. From some conversations I have had with people involved, the impression is of a police officer trying to negotiate a hostage situation. There is an innocent victim who has to be protected — Ukraine — there is a wild-eyed criminal with a knife at the victim’s throat — Russia — and there is the American cop, hoping to calm the miscreant, but with the threat of the SWAT team’s snipers at his back if things escalate. There may be some sad or traumatic backstory that made the knife-wielder what he is today, but that is not really the cop’s concern. For Moscow, I feel these are more like divorce negotiations at the end of a long, increasingly bitter marriage. On one level, the Kremlin may know that it is acting out, but it feels it has no alternative way of getting through to its smug, dishonest ex-partner, who cheated and lied, yet still believes it has a legitimate claim to both the kids and the beach house, as well as to feel morally superior for whatever pittance they leave in the settlement. In this context, the problem is precisely that negotiations over practical issues become intertwined with the psycho-drama of years of growing animosity. The breach of promises made to Gorbachev that NATO would move not an inch eastwards, Kosovo, Libya, the way the European Union Accession Agreement would practically, if not technically, preclude Ukraine’s membership of the Eurasian Economic Union — all these are not simply past bones of contention. For the Kremlin leadership they demonstrate a pattern of wilful deception that explains its impractical demands for “iron-clad” legal guarantees, not just verbal commitments. Western attempts to argue these cases, to challenge Moscow’s understandings of them or to consider them historical incidents of no current bearing, are thus regarded as gaslighting, equivalent to the unfaithful ex-spouse waving away past affairs as “ancient history” and seeking to limit any negotiations to the issues that suit them. Tellingly, for example, Ryabkov complained that the U.S. wanted to restore the work of the Russia-NATO Council, suspended since 2019, but “on their own terms, to an agenda that suits them, with an emphasis on so-called “Russian aggression” in Ukraine. To him, the attempt to define the parameters of any discussion was in itself an aggression. On one level, these may seem trivial analogies to draw, but the hope is that they convey the gulf between not just what each side is saying, but how they feel about the dispute. That is not to say there is no room for hope. The U.S. side seems to have avoided the temptation to respond to a recitation of Russian complaints in kind, but made an effort to talk them through. It also did not make any continuation of the discussions tightly dependent on immediate demands about a scaling down of the forces on the Ukrainian border or the like. Instead, it seems willing to give the conversation time — which is crucial to get through the opening bluster and at the very least let the Russians feel they are being heard. It’s less clear how far Moscow is willing to let the talks run if it doesn’t get the sense that there is any room for concrete progress on the one issue it seems to think is more important than all the rest: Ukraine, both in terms of NATO membership and also the potential for it to be used, even while not a member, as a base for Western military assets. The kinds of proposals Sherman has been able to put on the table so far — such as the deployment of missile defence systems in Europe and limits on military exercises — do not in any way add up to anything that Putin could consider a victory. Although we should not overstate the degree to which Putin is committed to the point that his choice is simply between “win or war,” an authoritarian regime has more scope to spin concessions as statesmanship. While the Russian people are not clamouring for conflict, he must see this as a crucial moment in his consistent efforts to redefine a European security order he feels is unfairly tilted against Russia. Ryabkov has made it clear that Russia wants NATO openly to repudiate its membership pledge to Ukraine and Georgia at its next summit, in Madrid. As that is not until June, it means there may be time yet for talk. Admittedly, at present, it is hard to see how any amount of discussion could bridge the gap between Russia and the West. The virtue of dialogue, though, is that new ideas and shared understandings can sometimes come from the back-and-forth. And with a reported 100,000-plus Russian troops on or near the Ukrainian border, and a system that has spent seven years doing everything it can to sanctions-proof itself to the point where it may credibly believe it can shrug off the “unprecedented sanctions” the West has threatened, dialogue is also better than the alternative.",1,1230,83.91,25.99,38.45,9.92,32.37,25.93,86.1,68.46,54.96,8.86,2.6,0.16,0.33,0.08,0.81,1.06,6.26,16.99,9.67,0.73,16.26,7.56,4.88,6.18,1.95,14.72,5.93,2.93,5.61,1.38,1.38,2.93,16.42,1.14,15.2,3.25,1.79,1.71,3.98,1.22,5.04,0,4.23,1.54,2.6,1.3,0.41,0.81,0.16,0.41,0.08,0,10.41,6.5,0.24,0.16,1.46,0.73,2.76,4.15,0.16,0,0,0.98,2.85,1.87,0.89,0.08,2.2,0.16,0.41,1.3,0.33,0.08,0.41,0.08,0,0,0.08,0,0,0,0,0.33,0.57,0.49,0,0,0,0.08,0.89,0,4.15,8.86,0.16,0.73,6.83,0.24,0.16,0.89,3.01,2.52,6.67,1.71,0,0,0,0,0,14.88,3.58,6.34,0.08,0,1.06,3.82

S . ",English,Russia,"The United States’ plans to levy sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin would be an “extreme” step that would signify a complete breakdown in ties between the two countries, the Kremlin said Thursday. U.S. senators, with support from the White House, unveiled a package of hard-hitting sanctions Wednesday evening intended to “devastate” the Russian economy should Moscow invade Ukraine. Among the measures would be personal sanctions against Putin, as well as several other top officials including Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. Sanctioning a head of state and other leading officials would be a rare move, as the U.S. has previously restricted its sanctions packages to lower-level officials. “Introducing sanctions against the head of the government or the head of Russia is an extreme measure which is comparable to a breakdown in relations,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in a briefing, according to the state-run TASS news agency. “What is Russia ready to do? Russia is always ready and will always do what is in the best interests of our country,” he added. Under the draft legislation, the U.S. government would also be required to investigate and publish a report into the personal wealth and assets of Putin, his family members and any other people the U.S. believes to hold assets on his behalf. Due to the U.S.’ leading role in the world economy, personal sanctions effectively prohibit individuals from traveling to or from accessing property and bank accounts held in most Western countries. Talks between Moscow, Washington and NATO in Europe this week have so far failed to move the sides closer to a resolution of what Moscow has called “large and fundamental differences.” Moscow wants legal guarantees that NATO will never admit Ukraine as a member and has called for troop deployments across the alliance to be rolled back to 1997 positions, before the bloc expanded into eastern Europe. The U.S. has branded the proposals a “non-starter,” and high-level talks in Geneva and Brussels this week have not managed to bring the sides closer together. Peskov on Thursday rejected NATO’s calls for Russia to de-escalate the situation by pulling back the estimated 100,000 troops that have been deployed close to the Ukrainian border. “It’s hardly possible that NATO can dictate to Russia where it should move troops on its own territory,” he said.",1,389,94.35,50.78,26.46,23.48,27.79,29.56,84.32,58.1,45.5,4.88,1.29,0,0.26,0,1.03,0,3.6,14.65,10.03,0.77,15.17,7.97,2.06,5.4,0.51,13.37,6.68,2.06,9,2.06,1.54,5.91,9.77,0.77,9,1.03,0.26,2.31,1.54,0.26,3.08,0,2.31,1.29,1.03,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.03,4.88,0.77,0,0.51,0,2.57,5.14,0,0,0,1.29,9.25,8.48,0.77,0,3.34,0,0.26,1.8,1.8,0,0.51,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.26,0.26,0,0,0.26,0,0,0,0.26,3.34,10.8,0.26,2.06,8.23,0.26,0,0,3.6,2.83,3.86,1.8,0,0,0,0,0,16.97,6.43,4.11,0.26,0,1.03,5.14

The United States and Russia had set firm lines ahead of the high-stakes security talks on Ukraine, with Washington warning of the risk of confrontation and Moscow ruling out concessions. A full day of talks was to follow Monday. Kazakhstan unrest Russia has evacuated nearly 1,500 of its nationals from Kazakhstan, said Moscow's Defense Ministry, which leads a regional military alliance that has been deployed to quell anti-government protests in the ex-Soviet Central Asian republic. Kazakhstan’s interior ministry said almost 8,000 people have been detained following a week of unrest. Its information ministry initially reported — before retracting its statement — that 164 people had died across the country during the violence. Trading barbs The U.S. and Russia traded barbs over the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization’s (CSTO) deployment to Kazakhstan, whose “peacekeeping” mission authorities expect will wrap up in one week. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said “one lesson of recent history is that once Russians are in your house, it’s sometimes very difficult to get them to leave.” Russia’s Foreign Ministry hit back with references to past U.S. invasions of other countries, saying “when Americans are in your house, it can be difficult to stay alive, not being robbed or raped.” ‘Gateway to Hell’ Turkmenistan's strongman leader has ordered experts to find a way to finally extinguish a massive five-decade old fire in a giant natural gas crater in the Central Asian country, dubbed the ""Gateway to Hell."" Citing environmental and economic concerns, President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov appeared on state television Saturday telling officials to put out the flames at the Darvaza gas crater in the middle of the vast Karakum desert. Orthodox Christmas Orthodox Christians observed Christmas on Friday, Jan. 7, with Patriarch Kirill leading the Russian Orthodox Church’s main midnight service at Christ the Savior Cathedral in Moscow.

S . Security Talks Fall Short",English,Russia,"Will hip-hop actually save the world? A senior Russian diplomat hinted that it might as well as he sang the praises of Kanye West, known simply as Ye, and the influential Russian rapper Oxxxymiron. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov divulged his musical tastes at the end of a week of security talks with the United States, NATO and Europe’s top security body OSCE that ultimately fell short of resolving deep-rooted geopolitical tensions. “If Oxxxymiron’s rap could be layered on Mr. West’s music, that would probably be good,” Ryabkov said in an interview with the Russian-language international broadcaster RTVI on Thursday. “Oxxxymiron’s lyrics are amazing in their depth, in my view they’re better listened to and studied without the musical background,” he elaborated. “And Mr. Ye — he was always experimenting with music,” the Russian diplomat added. “Even now, there’s harmony in his compositions, if you remove some aspects of modern processing… If you listen to Mr. West abstractly, there are some things you can play on the balalaika, the piano and the harp.” One other unexpected bit of news from this Ryabkov interview: turns out he is a huge fan of Lady Gaga, Russian rapper @norimyxxxo, and Kanye West, who he refers to as “Mister Ye” in a detailed discussion of his work pic.twitter.com/p8Ex8G8E9F TikTok users immediately took up the challenge and created a mashup of Oxxxymiron’s lyrics and Ye’s music. In the RTVI interview, Ryabkov also revealed that his favorite artist was Lady Gaga. “I think she is unique in every way — as a composer, as a singer, and as an actress,” he gushed. Ryabkov’s unexpected appreciation for popular music follows the footsteps of former Kremlin aide Vladislav Surkov, who has openly shared his affinity for the poetry of the late rapper Tupac. But the pop culture digression did not distract from the bleak reality that Russia and the West remained at odds over European security. Following three sessions with the U.S., NATO and the OSCE in three European capitals, Ryabkov told RTVI he sees no reason to “gather again and start the same discussions.” He did not rule out Moscow sending troops to Cuba and Venezuela in response to what the Kremlin perceives as the U.S. threatening its security with troops and missiles near Russian borders. The United States and NATO rejected Moscow’s demands to withdraw their troops from Eastern Europe and for ex-Soviet Ukraine and Georgia never to be admitted into the U.S.-led military alliance. The West has warned that an estimated 100,000 Russian troops and equipment amassed at the border with Ukraine signaled an “imminent” invasion, which the Kremlin denies.",1,437,86.8,80.26,13.84,32.97,27.31,26.77,81.46,59.5,46.68,8.92,6.18,0.46,0,1.37,3.2,0.69,2.75,14.65,9.15,1.14,13.96,4.58,3.43,7.09,0.92,10.53,5.26,2.75,4.58,1.37,1.14,2.06,9.15,0.92,8.24,2.06,0.92,0.69,1.37,0.46,2.75,0,3.66,2.29,1.37,0.69,0.69,0,0,0,0,0,15.1,6.18,0.69,1.37,0.46,0,2.97,10.07,0,0,0.92,3.89,5.49,3.43,2.06,0,4.58,2.75,0,1.83,0,0,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.23,0,0,0,0.69,0.46,0,0,0,1.37,0.23,2.06,11.67,0.69,0.23,7.32,0.69,2.29,0.23,3.2,4.58,3.89,0.69,0.46,0.46,0,0,0,19.68,6.18,5.49,0.23,0,2.29,5.49

Almaty, the country's former capital, had been nearly completely offline since Wednesday, but local and foreign websites were accessible again Monday morning, following the worst unrest in the ex-Soviet republic's independent history. The Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), a Moscow-led regional military bloc that has dispatched peacekeeping troops to the country, was set to hold an online summit on the crisis Monday, with the Kremlin confirming Russian President Vladimir Putin's attendance. AFP correspondents saw public transport on the streets of Almaty for the first time since protests descended into violence earlier this week, leaving strategic government buildings burned and gutted and businesses counting the costs of a looting spree. Lyudmila, a pensioner who was waiting for a bus in the city center and gave only her first name, said she was alerted to the internet's reappearance by a messenger call from relatives in Ukraine. ""I had no idea that we were back online again,"" she said. She told AFP that during clashes on Wednesday night, injured soldiers had been dragged into the courtyard of the apartment building where she lived for emergency treatment. Kazakhstan has framed the violence in Almaty as an attack by ""terrorist groups"" and expressed displeasure at foreign media coverage of the events, which began with protests over a fuel price hike in the west of the country on Jan. 2. On Monday the government said foreign media reports had created ""the false impression that the Kazakhstan government has been targeting peaceful protestors."" ""Our security forces have been engaging with violent mobs who were committing brazen acts of terror,"" the foreign ministry said in the statement. But the authoritarian government has also struggled to firm up its own narrative. On Sunday evening the information ministry retracted a statement that had appeared in an officially run Telegram channel earlier that said more than 164 people had died in the unrest. Two private websites that had reported the news said the information ministry had told them the statement was the result of a ""technical mistake."" Officials previously said 26 ""armed criminals"" had been killed and that 16 security officers had died. In total, 5,800 people have been detained for questioning, the presidency said in a statement on Sunday. Nur-Sultan, the city that replaced Almaty as capital in 1997 and which was renamed in honor of 81-year-old founding president Nursultan Nazarbayev in 2019, saw comparatively little unrest. The crisis comes with tensions between Moscow and the West at post-Cold War highs over fears of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, with talks between Russia and the U.S. to take place in Geneva on Monday after a working dinner on Sunday evening. Russia has ruled out any concessions at the talks. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has thanked the Moscow-led CSTO for answering his request for help and sending a detachment of 2,500 troops to the country. Tokayev says the deployment will be temporary, but U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned on Friday that ""once Russians are in your house, it's sometimes very difficult to get them to leave."" While the precise contours of the political crisis that engulfed Kazakhstan are unclear, it is evident that the ruling elite has been roiled. On Saturday, authorities announced the arrest on treason charges of Karim Masimov, a high-profile Nazarbayev ally who was dismissed from his post as security committee chief at the height of the unrest. Nazarbayev, who was widely regarded as holding the strings in the oil-rich Central Asian country despite stepping down from the presidency in 2019, has not spoken in public since the crisis began. Nazarbayev's press secretary said on Twitter Saturday that Nazarbayev was in ""direct contact"" with Tokayev and called on Kazakhs to ""rally around"" the president. Nazarbayev hand-picked Tokayev as his successor after calling time on more than a quarter-century as head of state. Tokayev's spokesman said Sunday that he was ""taking decisions independently...not running to consultants.""",1,687,96.18,54.81,43.19,1.9,25.44,31.44,82.82,58.37,44.98,5.82,2.77,0.15,0.29,0.15,1.31,0.29,3.06,14.99,10.19,2.47,16.45,6.84,1.89,4.8,0.44,13.68,6.11,2.77,6.4,1.16,0.73,4.37,5.39,0,5.09,0.87,0.73,0.15,1.02,0.15,2.04,0,4.08,0.58,3.49,0.73,0,0.73,0.29,0.15,0.15,0,10.92,5.53,0.44,0.44,0.73,0.44,3.93,4.66,0.15,0.15,0.73,0.73,6.26,3.93,1.31,1.02,2.77,0.15,0.29,1.89,0.73,0,1.16,0.15,0,0,0,0,0,0.15,0.73,0.73,0,0.44,0,0,0,0,1.46,0.15,3.78,10.48,0.44,1.31,8.3,0.87,0,0.15,5.97,9.61,2.33,0.15,0,0,0,0,0,15.43,5.09,4.22,0,0,1.16,4.95

Prices for gas have soared this winter in Europe, with wholesale prices standing five times higher than last year in a number of countries. Moscow has been blamed for withholding shipments to Europe during a cold snap last year and keeping gas storage facilities low. The Kremlin and Gazprom, Russia’s monopoly gas exporter, have denied any wrongdoing, and said Europe should have struck multi-year contracts if it wanted to secure stable energy supplies, rather than relying on short-term market prices. Fatih Birol, director of the influential IEA, said Wednesday that Russia could boost gas supplies by at least a third but is choosing not to. “There are strong elements of tightness in the European gas market due to Russia’s behavior,” Bloomberg quoted Birol as saying. “The current storage deficit in the European Union is largely due to Gazprom.” It calculated Russian supplies to Europe were down 25% from 2020 levels in the fourth quarter of 2021, and were 22% below pre-pandemic levels. The IEA is an organization which represents 30 major economies, most European, and advises them on global energy policies. Russia is not a member. With gas prices at record highs across the continent, the IEA pointed out that Gazprom would stand to benefit from increasing supplies to Europe and selling more on the so-called spot market, but is instead refusing to do so. The criticism renews a bitter war of words between Russia, the EU and U.S. over whether Russia is abusing its role as Europe’s main energy supplier to secure final approval for its controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline. That initiative, led by Russia’s Gazprom, has been thrown into new uncertainty in recent days, with U.S. officials saying it would work to block the pipeline from ever going live if Russia invades Ukraine. Sweden became the latest individual country to criticize Russia’s gas policies Wednesday. The Scandinavian country’s energy minister set aside more than $600 million in government funds to help households deal with rising energy costs and said Russia was partly to blame for the high prices and economic hardship.",1,371,95.37,26.87,25.87,5.02,24.73,25.88,75.47,54.72,41.24,3.23,0.27,0,0,0,0,0.27,2.96,10.78,6.74,2.96,16.44,5.93,1.89,5.93,0.54,10.24,6.2,7.01,4.58,0.54,0.54,3.5,7.55,0.27,7.01,0.27,0.27,1.35,1.62,0,3.23,0,5.12,1.62,3.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.55,5.66,0.54,0,1.89,1.08,2.43,1.35,0.27,0,0,0,2.16,1.35,0.81,0,7.28,0,0.27,3.23,3.77,0,0.27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.27,0.27,0,0.27,0,0,0.27,0.81,0,2.96,8.89,0.54,0.81,6.74,0,0,0.81,4.85,3.77,3.23,0.27,0,0,0,0,0,14.82,5.12,4.58,0,0,1.62,3.5

Putin's remarks came days after 2,500 Russian, Belarusian, Armenian, Tajik and Kyrgyz troops were deployed across Kazakh cities to defend key state facilities as part of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) alliance. “We will not allow the realization of so-called color revolution scenarios,” Putin said during Monday's videoconference of CSTO members, according to the state-run RIA Novosti news agency. He accused unidentified “outside forces” of interfering “in the internal affairs of our states,” echoing the Kazakh authorities’ latest claims of foreign links in the unrest. “They used well-organized and well-controlled militant groups… including those who had obviously been trained in terrorist camps abroad,” Putin said, calling Kazakhstan the target of “international terrorism.” Putin also stressed that the CSTO forces would only remain in Kazakhstan for a ""limited"" time period. Russian officials and pro-Kremlin media have blamed the West for trying to foment a “color revolution” in Kazakhstan — a similar reprise voiced during popular uprisings in ex-Soviet Georgia, Ukraine and Belarus in recent years. Speaking at the CSTO summit, Kazakhstan’s President Kassym Jomart-Tokayev called the week of violence “an attempted coup d’etat.” The Kremlin also criticized the role of social media in fueling the unprecedented protests in Kazakhstan. “Social networks obviously have both good and harmful elements. The task is to take measures to stop the harmful side,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday. “This is not new, it’s just once again been confirmed by the recent events in Kazakhstan.” Authorities in Kazakhstan shut down internet access across the country amid the nationwide protests last week, with access still limited in major cities for days after the unrest. Putin has been a longtime critic of social media’s potential for influencing young people and has recently taken more aggressive steps to limit the kind of content that can be shared online, slapping multimillion dollar fines on the likes of Google and Facebook, for instance, for refusing to remove content linked to Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration has dismissed claims that it was behind the unrest. Oil- and uranium-producing Kazakhstan has been left reeling in the wake of unprecedented unrest that erupted earlier this month in the midst of protests over a fuel price hike in the west of the country. Dozens have been killed in the unrest and the interior ministry said earlier Monday that nearly 8,000 people had been detained in operations executed by several branches of the security services.

Alongside Russia, CSTO member states Armenia, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan sent troop contingents to Kazakhstan, an important regional power with vast energy resources and a founding member of the Eurasian Economic Union, a Russia-led regional trade bloc. Tokayev said that intervention was necessary to counter a “terrorist threat” after protests against a fuel price hike spread nationwide, with demonstrators in Kazakhstan’s commercial capital Almaty seizing weapons, setting government buildings alight and shutting down the country’s main international airport. Kazakh media have reported that at least twelve police officers have been killed during the unrest, with “dozens” more fatalities reported. On Thursday morning, footage circulated on social media showed Kazakh army units exchanging gunfire with armed opponents as they attempted to retake Almaty. For many Russian observers, the sudden explosion of unrest in a country otherwise known for political stability, underlines a sense that intervention — which until only hours before Tokayev’s plea for help had been sworn off by the Kremlin — was unavoidable. “I don’t think Russia had any choice but to intervene,” said RIAC’s Kortunov, who pointed to a 2020 revolution in Kazakhstan’s Central Asian neighbor Kyrgyzstan, and last year’s Taliban takeover in Afghanistan. “Given how violent the unrest was and how unstable the region is, this seems like it was the only option,'' he added. “But it’s important that this is a short, time-limited operation and that we don’t get sucked in. The crisis in Kazakhstan comes at an awkward time for Russia. With tensions with the West on the rise amid a months-long military buildup on the Ukrainian border and fears of war, Russian has moved westward many of the units it usually deploys in Siberia and the Urals, along its frontier with Kazakhstan. As reports of unrest spread across Kazakhstan on Wednesday, parts of the pro-Kremlin media labeled the events a “Maidan”, referring to the 2014 revolution in Ukraine that touched off that country’s break with Russia, and accused the West of contriving the disturbances ahead of high-stakes U.S.-Russia talks this month. Tokayev likewise claimed that his country was under “external attack” from “bands of terrorists.” However, with Russia’s armed forces heavily engaged along the Ukrainian border, and much of its diplomatic capacity given over to ongoing talks with the U.S. on security guarantees, the Kazakhstan crisis represents an unwelcome turn of events for Moscow. “The Kremlin needs to divide [its] attention … and manage strategic instability on two fronts,” Alexander Baunov, a Russian foreign policy analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Center think tank, wrote on Twitter. For some experts, the biggest potential risk is Russia’s getting sucked into Kazakhstan’s domestic disputes. Though Kazakhstan has a large Russian majority, and the country’s north has sometimes been the object of irredentist dreams, Russo-Kazakh relations have been generally friendly since the end of the U.S.S.R. With Russia now assuming a leading role in underwriting Kazakhstan’s government, RIAC’s Kortunov fears an outpouring of Kazakh nationalism and disruption of the country’s fragile internal ethnic balance. Previous Russian interventions in post-Soviet countries have seen friendly states take sharp anti-Russian turns, Kortunov noted. “There’s a real chance that we could see the rise of anti-Russian sentiment in Kazakhstan, along the lines of Ukraine or Georgia,” he said. The crisis in Kazakhstan is also likely to impinge on Russia’s domestic politics. Though both countries have been largely stable under long-standing authoritarian regimes, widespread economic frustrations and inequality have eaten away at both governments’ popular standing. In Russia, as in Kazakhstan, unpopular socio-economic reforms including a 2018 pension age increase, and wage stagnation have driven down the president’s once sky-high approval rating. A recent Levada Center poll showed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s electoral rating — the number of Russians ready to vote for his re-election — at 32%, a record low. “Putin generally does believe in his own popularity,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of R.Politik, a political consultancy firm. “But the events in Kazakhstan could make him doubt how sustainable that popularity really is.” For some opposition-minded Russians, recalling how the outbreak of unrest in Belarus in summer 2020 presaged an unprecedented crackdown at home, events in Kazakhstan bodes ill for Russian liberties. “We’ll be the ones to pay for the Kazakhs’ freedom,” wrote Kirill Martynov, deputy editor of Russia’s independent Novaya Gazeta newspaper, on Twitter, predicting a crackdown by Russian security services fearing copycat protests across the border. For others, the protests in Kazakhstan — which were in large part directed against Nursultan Nazarbayev, the country’s founding president who resigned in 2019 but still retains extensive behind-the-scenes powers — could influence Vladimir Putin’s choice on whether to stay in office or not. After Nazarbayev — who is personally close to Putin — departed from the presidency to head his country’s powerful Security Council, some observers suggested that the Russian president might eventually follow the Kazakh model, by handing over day-to-day responsibilities to a hand-picked successor while retaining ultimate control. However, the outpouring of rage against the man who has led Kazakhstan since it was part of the Soviet Union, including scenes of a Nazarbayev statue in the city of Taldykorgan being felled by protesters, may lead Putin to conclude that loosening his grip on power is dangerous. Tokayev’s Wednesday announcement that he was taking over the country’s Security Council, displacing his erstwhile patron, only underlines the risks of any handover of power. “Kazakh events make [the] Kazakhstan power transit scenario virtually impossible for Russia,” wrote Carnegie’s Baunov. “Now Putin will hardly be inclined to leave his position to a successor.”",1,1018,96.89,44.12,35.09,4.7,27.51,34.68,78.09,54.32,41.94,4.81,2.06,0.2,0.29,0,1.08,0.1,2.75,13.06,8.74,1.08,16.6,5.21,2.65,4.32,0.29,10.71,5.6,3.54,6.88,1.67,0.79,4.91,8.84,0.2,8.64,1.67,1.77,0.49,2.06,0.39,2.95,0.1,3.24,0.59,2.55,0.88,0.2,0.59,0.29,0.29,0,0,8.15,3.73,0.59,0.2,1.08,0.1,1.87,3.83,0,0,0,1.18,8.25,3.73,4.32,0.2,3.14,0.1,0.29,1.87,0.98,0.1,0.49,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1,0.2,0.49,0,0.39,0,0,0,0,1.28,0,2.55,9.82,0.1,1.47,7.47,0.39,0.1,0.49,3.83,4.22,2.95,1.18,0.2,0.2,0,0,0,20.83,4.52,6.58,0,0,3.44,6.29

The energy-rich nation of 19 million people has been rocked by a week of upheaval with nearly 6,000 — including a number of foreigners — detained over the unrest. At least 164 people were killed in the riots, including 103 in the largest city Almaty, which saw some of the fiercest clashes between protesters and police. The new figures mark a drastic increase in the death toll, as officials previously said 26 ""armed criminals"" had been killed and 16 security officers had died. In total, 5,800 people have been detained for questioning, the presidency said in a statement on Sunday after President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev held a crisis meeting. The figures included ""a substantial number of foreign nationals"", it said without elaborating. ""The situation has stabilised in all regions of the country,"" even if security forces were continuing ""cleanup"" operations, the statement added.  Fuel price rises sparked the unrest that broke out a week ago in western provincial areas but quickly spread to large cities, including the economic hub Almaty, where riots erupted and police opened fire using live rounds. The interior ministry, quoted Sunday by local media, put property damage at around 175 million euros ($199 million). More than 100 businesses and banks were attacked and looted and more than 400 vehicles destroyed, the ministry reportedly said. A relative calm appeared to have returned to Almaty, with police sometimes firing shots into the air to stop people approaching the city's central square, an AFP correspondent said. Supermarkets were reopening on Sunday, media reported, amid fears of food shortages. Kazakhstan said Saturday its former security chief had been arrested for suspected treason, as Russia hit back at U.S. criticism of its deployment of troops to the crisis-hit country. News of the detention of Karim Masimov, a former prime minister and longtime ally of Kazakhstan's ex-leader Nursultan Nazarbayev, came amid speculation of a power struggle in the ex-Soviet nation. The domestic intelligence agency, the National Security Committee (KNB), announced Masimov had been detained on Thursday on suspicion of high treason. President Tokayev sacked Masimov after protests turned into widespread violence, with government buildings in Almaty stormed and set ablaze. Masimov, 56, was fired at the height of the unrest on Wednesday, when Tokayev also took over from Nazarbayev as head of the powerful security council. Nazarbayev's spokesman Aidos Ukibay on Sunday again denied rumours the ex-president had left the country and said he supported the president. Ukibay added that Nazarbayev voluntarily ceded control of the security council.  In a hardline address to the nation on Friday, Tokayev said 20,000 ""armed bandits"" had attacked Almaty and authorised his forces to shoot to kill without warning. Much of the public anger appeared directed at Nazarbayev, who is 81 and had ruled Kazakhstan since 1989 before handing over power. Many protesters shouted ""old man out!"" in reference to Nazarbayev, and a statue of him was torn down in the southern city of Taldykorgan. Critics accuse him and his family of staying in control behind the scenes and accumulating vast wealth at the expense of ordinary citizens. The full picture of the chaos has often been unclear, with widespread disruptions to communications including days-long internet shutdowns. Flights into the country have been repeatedly cancelled and Almaty's airport will remain closed ""until the situation is stabilised"", authorities said Sunday. Tokayev has thanked the Moscow-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) for sending troops to help deal with the unrest. The CSTO has been dispatching several thousand troops to Kazakhstan, including Russian paratroopers, who have been securing strategic sites. Tokayev says the deployment will be temporary, but U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned on Friday that Kazakhstan may have trouble getting them out. ""I think one lesson in recent history is that once Russians are in your house, it's sometimes very difficult to get them to leave,"" Blinken told reporters.

Kiev slammed as “political” this week’s contract that will supply 4.5 billion cubic meters of Russian natural gas to Hungary every year until 2036 through non-Ukrainian transit routes. “Gazprom stopped gas transit through Ukraine to Hungary,” Yuri Vitrenko, the CEO of Ukraine’s pipeline operator Naftogaz, wrote on Facebook. Vitrenko accused Gazprom of using gas exports as a “weapon” and said the Hungary deal “clearly demonstrates” its intent after Russia launches another pipeline that bypasses Ukraine to deliver gas to Germany, Nord Stream 2. “A joint statement from the United States and Germany indicates that in case of the Kremlin using gas as a weapon, there should be an appropriate reaction,” he said, referring to a U.S.-German deal in July that would threaten Russia with sanctions and extend gas transit through Ukraine. “We are now waiting for sanctions imposed on a 100% subsidiary of Gazprom, the Nord Stream 2 operator,” the Naftogaz CEO said. Gazprom and the Kremlin have dismissed Ukraine’s concerns about the loss of its role as a transit provider. Russia and Gazprom have also maintained that the $12-billion Nord Stream 2 would increase the stability of Russian gas supplies to Europe. Ukraine’s accusations come amid calls by European parliamentarians to investigate possible market manipulation by Gazprom amid record-high gas prices in Europe. The EU lawmakers claim that the company refuses to export gas to exert pressure on Europe as Nord Stream 2 awaits certification by German regulators after its recent completion. The Kremlin says Russia is fulfilling its gas export obligations under existing contracts and denies that it is attempting to speed up the Nord Stream 2 approval process through natural gas export manipulation. Ukraine makes around $3 billion a year by transiting Russian gas to Europe — a commercial relationship which has persisted despite the ongoing war between Russian-backed separatists in the Donbass and Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.",1,344,97.33,45.22,6.76,4.42,28.67,35.17,68.02,46.51,38.08,5.52,0.58,0,0.29,0,0.29,0,4.94,12.5,7.56,3.78,17.15,3.2,1.74,5.23,0,7.27,2.62,2.62,6.69,0.58,0.87,5.23,6.1,0.29,5.81,0.29,2.03,1.16,0.29,0.29,1.16,0,2.62,0.29,2.33,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.1,4.07,0,0,1.16,0.58,1.74,1.74,0,0,0,0.29,5.23,3.2,2.03,0,4.94,0,0,3.49,1.16,0.29,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.29,0.29,0,0.58,0,0,0.87,0,2.33,6.1,0.29,0.87,5.23,0,0,0,3.78,1.74,2.91,0.58,0,0,0,0,0,14.83,4.36,2.62,0,0,2.03,5.81

Viktor Bryukhanov was the plant’s first and only director during its years of operation, having also managed the construction of the Chernobyl nuclear station from 1970 to 1977. Bryukhanov was fired within weeks of the April 1986 explosion. Authorities in Soviet Ukraine sentenced him to 10 years in prison on charges of safety violations. He was released after he had served half of his jail term. The Chernobyl nuclear power station’s press service announced Bryukhanov’s passing on its Facebook page Wednesday. It did not indicate a cause of death. “The plant team and administration express their deepest condolences to the family and friends of the deceased,” it said. Bryukhanov was famously portrayed by Con O’Neill in HBO’s critically acclaimed 2019 “Chernobyl” miniseries, which documented the aftermath of the nuclear accident and the Soviet-era mismanagement of the response efforts. The April 1986 explosion at the Chernobyl power plant in Soviet Ukraine spread radioactive material across much of the Northern Hemisphere, affecting tens of thousands of people. Secret documents declassified by Ukraine earlier this year showed Bryukhanov’s first post-disaster report assured the authorities that radiation levels following the meltdown were “under control.” Born in Soviet Uzbekistan on Dec. 1, 1935, Bryukhanov relocated to Ukraine, also part of the U.S.S.R., in 1966 after graduating with an electrical engineering degree from the Tashkent Polytechnic Institute and working at the country’s thermal power plant.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has offered to meet Putin to discuss the return of annexed Crimea and resolve the seven-year conflict with pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine. But the Kremlin has rebuffed Zelenskiy’s request, refusing to negotiate the status of Crimea and saying that two sides’ agendas for a face-to-face meeting do not align. Writing in the Kommersant business daily, Medvedev criticized Zelenskiy as “weak,” “ignorant” and “unreliable” — without referring to him by name — and attacked the country’s “complete dependence” on the United States. “How can you negotiate and strike deals with him?” wrote Medvedev, who was demoted last year from the post of prime minister to the newly created position of deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council. “It’s pointless for us to deal with vassals.” Medvedev also accused the Ukrainian leader of working with neo-Nazi and fascist groups, and made references to Zelenskiy’s Jewish roots. Medvedev slammed the Ukrainian president for “serving the most rabid nationalist forces in Ukraine” and warned that “at some point, when the political situation changes, they’ll sew a yellow star on your back.” Russia has for years criticized what it sees as a powerful fascist element behind various anti-Russia policies and movements in Ukraine. “Appeasing these attitudes clearly disgusts him, since his and his family’s whole history stands against such vileness,” Medvedev said. “But, alas, he has to. Otherwise, they’ll smear his brains against the wall. So he is forced to preach their ideology.” The former prime minister recommended Moscow wait for “sane” figures to replace Zelenskiy and other Ukrainian leaders before the Kremlin considers opening negotiations. “Russia knows how to wait. We are patient people,” Medvedev wrote. The Kremlin said later Monday that Medvedev’s article “runs in unison” with Russia’s view of the current Ukrainian government.",1,327,92.83,70.26,24.81,2.23,18.17,37.92,78.29,53.82,41.9,7.03,4.89,0,0.61,0.61,2.45,0.92,2.14,11.93,7.34,0.61,15.9,3.98,2.45,6.42,0.61,10.4,5.5,2.14,8.26,0.92,0.61,6.73,9.17,0,9.17,1.83,2.45,0.61,0,0.31,4.28,0,4.59,0.92,3.67,0.31,0,0.31,0,0,0,0,18.04,8.87,0.31,0.31,1.83,0.61,4.89,8.87,0.31,0,0,2.45,6.73,4.59,2.14,0,6.12,0,0,5.5,0.31,0.61,0.92,0.61,0,0,0.31,0,0,0,0,0.61,0,0,0,0.31,0,0,0.92,0.31,1.83,7.03,0.31,1.22,4.89,0.92,0,0,5.2,3.98,3.67,1.22,0,0,0,0,0,24.16,5.2,4.28,0.31,0,3.67,10.7

Moscow said President Vladimir Putin, his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel instructed the ministers to work toward a meeting during a joint telephone call Monday. According to the Kremlin, it would take place within the framework of the ""Normandy Four"" — which usually brings together officials from Moscow and Kiev under the mediation of Paris and Berlin. The Kremlin did not say in its statement if Ukraine would take part in the meeting. However France's presidency said that it should involve Ukraine. The presidency also said in a statement that Macron and Merkel held a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy before speaking to Putin. Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert also confirmed the plans for the meeting, for which a date has not yet been set. The Kremlin said the leaders had instructed their foreign ministers to ""intensify their contacts and work"" after a ""difficult"" situation in eastern Ukraine. The leaders also agreed to consider organizing a summit, the Russian and German statements said. During the phone call, Putin accused the Kiev authorities of ""stubbornly evading"" fulfilling agreements reached at peace talks. France and Germany have been mediators in the conflict between Kiev and pro-Moscow separatists since 2015 in the so-called Normandy format and have been overseeing a fragile ceasefire. Angela Merkel visited both Moscow and Kiev in August. Afterward, she then expressed her hope that peace talks on the conflict between Kiev and pro-Russia separatists would continue after she left power. The Ukrainian army is locked in a simmering conflict with breakaway fighters in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions that erupted after Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014. The conflict has claimed more than 13,000 lives. Ukraine and its Western allies accuse Russia of sending troops and arms to support the separatists, which Moscow denies. The European Union on Monday imposed sanctions on eight more officials accused of targeting opponents of Russia's seizure of Crimea, ahead of a visit to Kiev by the bloc's top officials.

Clashes have regularly broken out in the east in recent weeks, undermining a ceasefire brokered last year that had raised hopes of ending a conflict that erupted in 2014 after Russia annexed Crimea. The Ukrainian army said that one serviceman was killed on Saturday when separatist fighters opened fire with small arms, while another soldier ""received a gunshot bullet wound incompatible with life"" on Monday. The fresh clashes come as Russia has massed thousands of its soldiers on its border with Ukraine, with the White House last week saying the number of Russian troops at the border was now greater than at any time since 2014. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's spokeswoman told AFP on Monday that Russia now has 41,000 troops on Ukraine's eastern border and 42,000 soldiers on the Crimean peninsula. Spokeswoman Yulia Mendel also said that Zelenskiy had sent a query to the Kremlin in late March requesting talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin over the escalating conflict, but was yet to receive an answer. ""We hope that President Vladimir Putin does not refuse dialogue,"" Mendel told AFP. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, however, denied that Moscow had received a request for talks. ""I am not aware of any such enquiries in recent days,"" he told reporters on Monday. The Kremlin, which has not denied the troop movements, has said it is not moving towards war with Ukraine, but also that it ""will not remain indifferent"" to the fate of Russian speakers in the east. The conflict, which has claimed more than 13,000 lives, has seen 28 Ukrainian soldiers killed since the start of the year compared to 50 in all of 2020.

Witnesses filmed around 30 unknown individuals barging into the office of Memorial, a group which documents Soviet-era repressions and victims of Josef Stalin’s Great Terror, shouting “fascists,” “shame” and telling viewers to leave because “the screening is over.” When police later appeared, they handcuffed the entrance doors to Memorial’s office and locked its staff and attendees inside for several hours, the group’s lawyer said. They also dismantled the office’s fire alarm system and took away a video recording device, the independent Novaya Gazeta paper reported. The film being shown was Polish director Agnieszka Holland’s “Mr. Jones,” released in 2019. It tells the story of Welsh journalist Gareth Jones, one of the first Western journalists to report on the 1932-33 Ukrainian famine, known as the Holodomor. “Of course [the attack] was against Memorial and not the film,” Memorial spokeswoman Natalia Petrova told Reuters. “The film was just a pretext,” she added. Russian authorities have for years attempted to thwart Memorial’s work, activists say, including through fines and searches of their premises across the country. Several Memorial activists have been imprisoned on what the group says are politically motivated charges, including Oyub Titiev, head of Memorial’s office in Chechnya and Yury Dmitriyev, head of its Karelian branch. Scholars estimate between 4-7.5 million people were killed in the Holodomor, a man-made disaster that Kiev and a handful of other countries have declared a genocide. Moscow has rejected those assertions and interpretation of the causes of the famine has remained a wedge between the two countries. The screening of “Mr. Jones” comes at a sensitive time for relations between Russia and Ukraine, amid the protracted war between Ukrainian government forces and pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine. Memorial lawyer Natalia Morozova accused police of allowing most of the men who had stormed the group's offices to leave without being questioned. They “didn’t show much zeal to detain even those who they managed to catch,” Morozova told the RBC news website. She added that police conducted lengthy interrogations of viewers and Memorial staff, forcing them to stay inside and provide detailed written statements. Lawyers were only allowed inside around midnight — four hours after the disruption — with staff and police on site until at least 1 a.m. Moscow time.

The latest step pushing the Baltic Sea pipeline to completion comes as Europe faces an energy crisis with natural gas reserves at a low level and energy prices surging. ""The gas-in procedure for the first string of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline has started,"" Nord Stream 2 AG said in a statement. ""This string will be gradually filled to build the required inventory and pressure as a prerequisite for the later technical tests,"" said the Switzerland-based company, which is owned by a subsidiary of Russian gas giant Gazprom. It said it would publish more information about ""further technical steps in due time."" Nord Stream 2 has for years divided European capitals and raised tensions between the bloc and Washington. The pipeline diverts supplies from an existing route through Ukraine and is expected to deprive Europe's ally of an estimated 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) annually in transit fees from Russia. Ukraine — in conflict with Russia since Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea — has warned Europe that Nord Stream 2 could be used by Moscow to exert pressure. The United States has reluctantly signed off on the project, but says it will sanction Moscow if the pipeline is used as a weapon. ""We continue to oppose this pipeline,"" U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said on Monday. ""We continue to believe it is a geopolitical project of the Russian Federation and we will continue to apply the law consistent with our periodic reviews which, of course, remain ongoing."" When Gazprom announced last month that construction was complete, Kiev vowed to continue lobbying against the project ""even after the gas is turned on."" Gas prices in Europe around the same time were skyrocketing in anticipation of higher winter demand and the International Energy Agency urged Russia open the taps. Moscow has said that it is waiting for Nord Stream 2 to come online before delivering more gas, but said the pipeline would help combat surging gas prices in Europe. Running from Russia's Baltic coast to northeastern Germany, the underwater, 1,200-kilometer (745-mile) pipeline follows the same route as Nord Stream 1, which was completed over a decade ago. Like its twin, Nord Stream 2 will be able to pipe 55 billion cubic meters of gas per year to Europe, increasing the continent's access to relatively cheap natural gas at a time of falling domestic production. Germany, Europe's top economy, imports around 40% of its gas from Russia, and Berlin believes the pipeline has a role to play in the country's transition away from coal and nuclear energy.",1,457,97.51,41.36,40.89,9.65,26.88,26.48,73.96,53.83,41.14,4.38,0.88,0,0.88,0,0,0,3.5,12.47,9.19,4.38,16.63,5.69,1.75,4.6,0,10.72,5.69,5.03,2.63,1.31,0.22,1.09,5.47,0,5.47,0.88,0.88,0.66,0.44,0.44,2.19,0,2.19,0.44,1.53,0.22,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.03,3.72,0.44,0,0.66,0,2.41,1.53,0,0.22,0,0.22,3.06,1.53,0.66,0.88,5.03,0.22,0,3.06,1.75,0,0.22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.44,0,0.22,0.22,0.88,0,0,0.66,0,2.41,8.53,0.22,2.19,6.78,0,0,0.22,5.47,4.6,3.72,1.31,0,0,0,0,0,14.44,4.38,3.94,0,0,1.31,4.81

""The decision to withdraw the accreditation of eight members of the Russian delegation to NATO was done based on intelligence because these are undeclared Russian intelligence officers,"" Stoltenberg said. ""We have seen an increase in Russian malign activities, at least in Europe and therefore we need to act."" The NATO chief said that the decision to kick out the Russian representatives was not ""linked to any particular event"" — but gave no more details over the move. NATO announced Wednesday it had decided to strip the ""undeclared Russian intelligence officers"" of official accreditation to the alliance and halve the size of the Russian delegation to 10. Stoltenberg reiterated that the ""relationship between NATO and Russia is at its lowest point since the end of the Cold War. And that's because of the Russian behavior."" Ties between the West and Moscow have slumped in recent years since the Kremlin's 2014 annexation of Crimea and over its involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Russia has long had an observer mission to NATO as part of a two-decade-old NATO-Russia Council meant to promote cooperation in common security areas, but it is not a member of the U.S.-led Alliance. The Kremlin said earlier Thursday that the expulsions showed NATO members have no desire to normalise relations with Moscow. ""There is an obvious contradiction in the statements of NATO representatives about the desire to normalise relations with our country and in real actions,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. The Russian mission has been downsized once before, when seven of its members were ejected after the 2018 poisoning by the Novichok nerve agent on a Russian former double agent, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter in Britain. Accreditation applications by another three Russian diplomats were denied. Meetings of a NATO-Russia council have not been held since 2019 against the backdrop of the heightened tensions. ""We are ready to engage in meaningful dialogue with with Russia, and we are ready also to convene a NATO-Russia Council meeting,"" Stoltenberg said. ""We have actually invited Russia for a long time. So far, Russia has not responded positively."" Sky News reported that NATO's decision came after information was revealed in April about fatal explosions at a Czech ammunition depot in 2014 that Prague says involved two Russian spies — identified as allegedly implicated in the Skripal poisoning. That Czech Republic-Russia incident led to the mutual expulsion of dozens of EU and Russian diplomats and other embassy staff.",1,433,95.95,57.95,34.57,12.9,22.79,32.79,82.22,57.51,46.19,4.85,1.62,0,1.39,0,0.23,0,3.23,15.47,9.47,2.54,17.55,6,2.08,6.24,1.39,11.32,5.54,3.7,7.62,4.16,0.23,3.23,10.62,0.46,10.16,2.31,2.31,0.69,0.69,0.92,3,0,3.93,1.39,2.08,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.55,5.08,1.15,0,0.23,0,3,6,0.23,0,0.23,0.46,8.08,4.62,3.46,0,4.39,0,0,4.39,0,0,0.92,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.23,0.69,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,0.23,0,3.7,8.78,0,1.15,6,0.92,0.23,0.46,4.39,7.39,2.54,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,13.86,4.85,2.31,0,0,0.92,5.77

Her legacy will live on long after she steps down from the leadership. While firmly embedded within the European Union, Germany has essentially become its sole, though by no means, absolute leader. It is a peaceful champion of a soft European version of liberalism. Vocal support for values does not, however, translate into interventionism. Nor does it prevent Germany from pursuing its business interests or waging a pragmatic foreign policy — within the limits of the EU/NATO framework. Merkel’s leadership was almost always steady and dependable, and her policies were largely predictable. True, neither Germany within the EU nor the EU within the U.S.-led system have achieved strategic autonomy on her watch, but that was hardly Merkel’s objective. Viewed from Moscow, Merkel’s legacy can be summarized as follows: reconfirmation of Germany’s Atlanticist orientation; achievement of a primus inter pares position within the European Union; and distancing from Russia, while keeping in touch with it. In 2005, Merkel succeeded Gerhard Schroeder, the Social Democratic leader who took over from Helmut Kohl as a result of the 1998 election. Under Schroeder, newly reunified Germany’s ambition to play a more autonomous role in world affairs reached its peak. In 2003, Berlin, Paris, and Moscow had even formed a new entente, as Russia’s then foreign minister Igor Ivanov called it, to oppose the U.S. invasion of Iraq and potentially act as a counterweight to Washington. The vision of a greater Europe from the Atlantic to the Pacific based on the marriage between the German/European industry and Russian resources was just about to take shape. Merkel, a former East German citizen, faced the need to be accepted by Germany’s largely Atlanticist political elite, as well as by Berlin’s principal allies in Washington. Mending strained ties with the United States became a priority for her, and she worked hard on it. Merkel succeeded, and in return, she got American support for Germany’s leading role in Europe, albeit within the general framework of U.S. global leadership. This did not mean Germany blindly following the United States at every turn: in 2008, Merkel refused to accept George W. Bush’s bid to include Ukraine and Georgia in NATO, and in 2010, Germany took no part in the NATO military operation in Libya, even abstaining at the relevant UN Security Council vote alongside China, India, and Russia. At the same time, Merkel did not allow the embarrassing public scandal over U.S. intelligence tapping her cell phone to get out of hand. During the Donald Trump years, Merkel — who did not get along too well with the forty-fifth U.S. president — rose to become the de facto temporary leader of the liberal West. That unanimous and apparently natural choice of the vast majority of European and American elites was recognition of the national prestige of both Merkel personally and Germany, and of their clear evocation of democratic values and the practice of liberal policies. Merkel’s informal tenure as leader of the West ended with the election of Joe Biden, but with Britain’s departure from the European Union following the 2016 referendum, Germany’s position as Washington’s principal ally within the EU had been elevated even higher. This is the main element of Angela Merkel’s legacy. When Merkel first became chancellor, Germany usually worked in tandem with France within the EU. Over time, Berlin rose to a position of preeminence, de facto making Paris its junior associate. During her tenure, Merkel worked with four French presidents: Jacques Chirac, Nicolas Sarkozy, François Hollande, and Emmanuel Macron. With every change of command at the Élysée Palace, the German chancellor appeared to stand taller. The appointment of her ally Ursula von der Leyen as president of the European Commission was a sign of the influence of both Germany and Merkel. To achieve that position, Germany had to manage major EU expansion, the debt crisis, and Brexit. Merkel did well on all three. Her only major failure was the immigration crisis of 2015, but once the negative consequences of the massive influx of migrants became apparent, she worked hard to stem the inflow and limit the damage. Berlin’s single leadership had to be accepted by its European partners, including those who were historically fearful of Berlin’s diktat. Particularly important in this regard were Germany’s eastern neighbors, Poland and the Baltic states, which were historically allergic to anything that might look like a reborn German Reich or any form of German-Russian collusion. To get their backing, Berlin had to take account of those countries’ special interests. It should be added, though, that German business gained much from the expansion of the EU to integrate Eastern European countries. Angela Merkel was the first German chancellor to speak Russian fluently, but this did not lead to a closer relationship with Moscow. In fact, the relationship grew markedly more distant, for several reasons. One was the reaffirmation of Germany’s Atlanticist credentials, even at a time when Russia’s relations with the United States were rapidly deteriorating. In 2007, Merkel was in the room in Munich when Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered his famous speech in which he lashed out at U.S. global hegemony. Another reason already alluded to was the enlargement of the European Union from 2004 to include a dozen former communist countries. This changed both the complexion of the EU and the balance within it. Many of the new entrants had had painful relations with the Soviet Union and the Russian Empire, or had even been part of the Russian realm in the past, and were still reeling from it. Berlin, which aspired to lead the expanding European Union, could not afford to ignore those sentiments. The EU’s enlargement also turned Eastern European countries into important trading partners and investment opportunities for Germany: far more so than the Russian Federation, which had long dominated Germany’s eastern trade. Finally, as the Cold War receded into the past, the division of Germany and Berlin was overcome, and the country’s physical security was assured, German society started to pay more attention to other issues, primarily environmental and climate-related, and social and political values, including human and minority rights. To the post–Cold War generation of German politicians, Russia was no longer the country that held the key to German reunification; nor were its forces a huge presence in East Germany; nor was it viewed as a land of economic opportunity in the east. Rather, post-Soviet Russia stood for a failing attempt at democratization, a grossly inefficient and primitive oligarchical economy, and an increasingly authoritarian regime led by a former KGB operative who used to work in East Germany. Angela Merkel’s personal relationship with Vladimir Putin was apparently decorous throughout, but never overly close. There was certainly no warmth there, unlike between Putin and Schroeder, or even Boris Yeltsin and Helmut Kohl. However, the German-Russian relationship initially moved forward with economic projects, political consultations, and high-level societal fora like the German-Russian Petersburg Dialogue. There was a moment in mid-2011 when Merkel publicly expressed her preference for Putin’s chosen interim successor, President Dmitry Medvedev. Like then U.S. president Barack Obama, the German chancellor saw Medvedev, in contrast to Putin, as a modernizer and a much more convenient partner for the West. At that time, Merkel and her then vice chancellor and foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier were promoting a modernization partnership with Russia in the hope that modernization would not be limited to technology and the economy — in line with Putin’s idea of a Greater Europe from Lisbon to Vladivostok, which he laid out before the German business community during a 2010 visit — but would also transform the Russian political system and society according to the Western model. In that respect, Berlin’s expectations turned out to be wishful thinking. Major disappointment set in as Putin decided to run for the Russian presidency again. The last seven-plus years of Merkel’s involvement with the Kremlin were marked and marred by the Ukraine crisis, Crimea, and the armed conflict in Donbas. As a result, the post–Cold War German-Russian partnership degenerated into a transactional relationship with increasing mutual criticism and decreasing trust. In Putin’s eyes, Berlin’s connivance with Paris and Warsaw over what the Kremlin regarded as the Maidan coup in Kyiv that toppled the elected president amounted to a massive breach of trust. In turn, Russia’s forceful reaction to the developments in Ukraine stunned Merkel and her colleagues. In vain did Putin appeal to German gratitude for Moscow having turned the key on reunification; Merkel, reflecting the views of not only the German political class, but also much of the public, saw Russia’s actions as changing borders by force and thus upsetting the post–Cold War order in Europe. Merkel took the lead in imposing rafts of EU sanctions on Russia. Unlike other Western leaders, however, Merkel did not respond to the crisis by severing all contact with Moscow in an attempt to “isolate” and thus “punish” Russia. The German chancellor, while being very critical of Russian policies, kept the line of communication to the Kremlin open. In February 2015, Merkel put at stake her own prestige by flying to Minsk for marathon negotiations to broker a ceasefire in Donbas. Since then, much of her interaction with Putin has been devoted to the conflict in Ukraine’s southeast. Her approach could be described as critical dialogue, with both sides trading critical arguments, but also looking for ways and means of managing the standoff. Germany’s critical public attitude toward Russia was not limited to Ukraine-related issues. Starting with the campaign focusing on the “values gap” with Russia and the thrashing of Germany’s own so-called Putin-Versteher, or Putin-empathizers, the criticism was becoming wider and more scathing. Accusations of Russian media meddling in German politics, of Russia’s involvement in the Bundestag hacking, and the murder of a former Chechen rebel commander in Berlin’s central Tiergarten marked a clear downward trend in the relationship. In 2020, Merkel publicly supported a German military laboratory’s findings that Russian anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny, who had been flown from Russia to Germany for emergency medical treatment, had been poisoned with a chemical nerve agent. Merkel herself visited the activist in a Berlin hospital. Symbolically, the Navalny incident closed the book on what had remained of the three-decades-long German-Russian partnership. The partnership may be in the past, but the relationship continues. In 2021, Merkel passed an important test in defending German interests from U.S. pressure. Despite the strained relations with Russia and vehement criticism from the EU’s eastern flank countries such as Poland and the Baltic states, not to mention hysterics from Ukraine, Merkel succeeded in reaching a deal with U.S. President Joe Biden on allowing the completion of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia under the Baltic Sea. Merkel’s unfailing consistency and stubborn determination under enormous pressure, which eventually led to a positive outcome for Germany, was closely watched and appreciated by the Kremlin. It was also appreciated that before leaving office, she made one last visit to Russia. Seen from Moscow, Angela Merkel’s long tenure was a period of relative, if not always palatable, predictability in German-Russian relations. Vladimir Putin often disagreed with the German chancellor, but he undoubtedly respected her. For Russian policymakers, Germany remains the European Union’s key member state. Historically, Moscow’s relations with the major powers have heavily depended on its interaction with the leaders of those powers. The future of the relationship will depend in no small measure on who succeeds her and how skilled that successor is at the art of statecraft. Merkel is leaving behind very big shoes to fill.

After almost all precincts were counted, the ruling Georgian Dream party led with 46.6% of the votes in Saturday's elections, while all of the opposition parties combined garnered 53.4%, official results showed. Critics have denounced a backsliding on democracy in Georgia, saying parliamentary elections held last October were rigged and accusing the ruling party of using criminal prosecutions to punish political opponents and journalists. Under an EU-brokered inter-party agreement in May, Georgian Dream had pledged to hold snap parliamentary elections if it won less than 43% of the municipal vote. But it unilaterally withdrew from the pact in July, sparking harsh criticism from the West, and Saturday's result frees them from the obligation to call snap polls. Georgian Dream said in a statement that the closely-watched elections ""were held at the highest democratic standards."" But opposition parties said Sunday widespread irregularities undermined the credibility of the elections, held in a tense atmosphere after Saakashvili, the country's foremost opposition leader and former president, was arrested on return from exile. ""The election results were falsified. We have witnessed intimidation and bribing of voters prior to the elections, multiple voting on the election day,"" Giorgi Baramidze, a leader of Saakashvili's United National Movement (UNM), told AFP. ""The elections' credibility has already been undermined by the fact that the leader of the opposition was first forced into exile and then arrested,"" he said referring to Saakashvili. ""We will use all the legal means to reverse the falsification."" Badri Japaridze, a leader of opposition Lelo party, said: ""The elections were marred by large-scale intimidation and bribing of voters, seriously affecting the electoral results."" In a number of major cities — including the capital Tbilisi — second round runoffs will have to be held on October 30 between mayoral candidates from the Georgian Dream and the UNM, the country's main opposition force. Saakashvili, 53, secretly returned to Georgia on Friday from Ukraine — where he heads a government agency steering reforms — ahead of the elections and was quickly detained for alleged abuse of office. The flamboyant pro-Western reformer and president in 2004-2013, denied any wrongdoing, denounced a six-year jail sentence in absentia as politically motivated and went on hunger strike following his arrest. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday he will be pressing for Saakashvili's return to Ukraine as he is a Ukrainian national and was stripped of his Georgian passport. Saakashvili's jailing aggravated the political crisis that engulfed Georgia last October when opposition parties denounced parliamentary elections as rigged, refused to take up their seats in the newly elected legislature and staged mass protests to demand snap polls. Prior to his arrest, Saakashvili had called on supporters to take to the streets ""to protect election results."" But opposition parties have so far refrained from staging protests, awaiting the conclusions from international monitors who are due to present their assessment later on Sunday. The United States has hinted at possible sanctions against Georgian officials over the country's backsliding on democracy. In comments to AFP through a representative, who visited him in prison on Saturday, Saakashvili said he returned to Georgia despite looming arrest ""to fight to the end against the oligarchic rule which kills Georgian democracy."" He was referring to former prime minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, a powerful oligarch and ruling party founder who is widely believed to be calling the shots in Georgia despite holding no political office.",1,589,97.63,57.28,17.98,1,26.77,37.52,79.63,52.29,41.26,4.07,3.06,0,0.34,0,1.7,0.51,1.02,12.05,9.17,1.53,16.47,4.92,1.7,5.09,0.17,11.21,4.58,2.04,14.94,1.87,0.51,12.73,6.96,0.68,6.28,0.51,2.21,0,1.02,0.17,2.21,0,5.94,1.19,4.75,0.34,0,0.34,0.17,0.17,0,0,12.39,7.3,0,0,3.06,0.68,2.04,4.92,0,0,0,1.7,9.85,9.51,0.34,0,2.89,1.02,0,1.87,0,0,0.51,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.17,0.17,0.85,0,0.34,0.17,0,0,0.17,0.68,0,2.21,6.28,0,1.02,5.6,0.17,0,0.17,5.43,7.81,1.19,1.36,0,0,0,0,0,15.79,4.07,5.09,0,0,1.87,4.75

Russia's population has been in near-constant decline since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, due to a low birth rate, an under-resourced healthcare system, and emigration. The coronavirus pandemic, which has killed at least 400,000 people in Russia according to the national statistic agency Rosstat, has seriously aggravated the problem. In 2020, the population shrank by 510,000 people — the sharpest decline in 15 years, Rosstat calculated. It found that the population, which numbered 146.2 million as of January 1, declined by another 595,000 people by the end of August. Russia has also seen its birth rate stagnate as the mortality rate spikes, Rosstat data shows. The country is seeing falling birth rates because the generation becoming parents now were born in the 1990s, when the birthrate fell drastically due to economic uncertainties. President Vladimir Putin, who has pointed to poverty as a key factor in limiting family size, has over the years announced a litany of financial incentives to encourage Russians to have more children to boost the population. The census comes as Russia is seeing a surge in coronavirus infections. This week the country set a pandemic high for both cases and deaths as Russia's jab drive stalls and a lack of strict restrictions allow the virus to spread unchecked. To help limit the spread, much of the census will be conducted online, while workers will be regularly tested for the virus, Rosstat said.

Chupik, an Uzbek activist who had held asylum in Russia since 2009, was detained at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport last month, with FSB officers telling her that her refugee status was revoked for alleged “document falsification” and that she is banned from entering Russia for 30 years. She has called the move “absolute nonsense” and expressed fears she could be jailed, tortured or killed if she were repatriated to Uzbekistan. “I am currently in Armenia in a beautiful spot just on the outskirts of Yerevan,” Chupik told The Moscow Times via WhatsApp. Last week, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Chupik’s deportation to Uzbekistan should be suspended, applying Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, which is applied as an urgent measure in cases where there is an imminent risk of causing irreparable harm. Russian law enforcement had also searched the apartment of Chupik’s 84-year-old mother two days after her detention. Chupik and her mother have now applied for asylum in Ukraine and are currently awaiting a response from the Ukrainian authorities, her aides have said. Chupik, 48, fled ex-Soviet Uzbekistan in 2005 following a bloody crackdown on protesters in the city of Andijan, claiming she was tortured by Uzbek special services. In Moscow, Chupik founded the Tong Jahoni (Morning of the World) NGO which provides free legal services to migrants who have faced pressure from law enforcement agencies. Each year, hundreds of thousands of migrant workers travel to Russia from former Soviet republics, mainly those in Central Asia, in search of better wages. Many face discrimination and abuse from Russian citizens and authorities. But since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, Russia has seen a mass outflow of migrant workers, triggering efforts to tackle an emerging labor shortage in industries like construction and agriculture. Earlier this year, Russia handed a 40-year entry ban to Tajikistan-born opposition activist Saidanvar Sulaimonov in what he called retaliation for his work on a Kremlin critic’s campaign for last month’s parliamentary election.",1,353,93.47,65.13,12.93,5.91,27.15,30.88,77.9,52.41,41.93,6.8,4.53,0.28,0,0,3.68,0,2.27,11.33,6.8,3.12,15.86,5.95,2.27,4.25,0,10.76,3.68,2.83,8.78,0.57,1.13,7.08,4.25,0,4.25,0,1.7,0.57,0.85,0,1.7,0,3.4,0.85,2.55,0.85,0,0.85,0.28,0,0,0.28,11.9,5.1,0,0,1.7,0.57,2.27,6.52,0.57,0,3.68,0.57,5.38,2.55,2.55,0.28,3.68,0,0.28,3.4,0.28,0,1.13,0.57,0.57,0,0,0,0,0,0.28,0.28,0,0,0.28,0,0,0,1.13,0,3.97,8.5,0.57,1.98,5.67,0.28,0,0,6.52,5.38,3.4,0.28,0.28,0.28,0,0,0,14.73,3.68,5.67,0,0,1.42,3.97

Not weaponizing football hooligans or COVID vaccines this time, but apparently gas. From U.S National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan to British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, politicians are queuing up to blame Russia for the current global gas crisis. The trouble is that not only is this bad analysis, it is also bad politics. The economics As has been documented, the current gas crisis has numerous causes, which have combined in a singularly problematic way. A year of coronavirus (COVID-19) which saw reserves scaled down in a “gas glut”; a hard winter and a hot summer, both of which meant greater consumption; accidents interrupting supply lines. All this is exacerbated by a heightened demand from Asia, which is essentially monopolizing the liquid natural gas (LNG) which otherwise represents the fungible supply often relied on to make up for shortfalls in piped gas. And, of course, European buyers who had not wanted to commit themselves to long-term contracts as a result ended up paying spot prices. But where does Russia fit? Moscow has been fulfilling its contract commitments and, far from somehow “choking off” the gas as British sources have been claiming, is supplying close to record levels. Of course, Gazprom will be looking to maximise its profits, just as the Kremlin is inevitably trying to use the situation to push German regulators into giving the final OK to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. The morality What, though, is the sin here? First of all, Russia has no moral duty to provide more gas whenever the West wants it. So long as they observe their contractual obligations, the rest is simple market economics. To be sure, it would be very convenient for everyone else if Moscow were willing and able to increase the supply, but considering the continued grip of Western sanctions on Russia, as well as the barrage of sanctimonious critiques (which, to be fair, it is not that the current regime doesn’t deserve, but which are not levelled against other regimes which may deserve it even more), should we expect Putin to go out of his way to do us a favour? Are the U.S. and Qatari LNG suppliers who eagerly pivoted to service the seemingly insatiable Asian market also being castigated as malign market manipulators and profiteers? The question is naturally rhetorical: of course not. Besides, how far could Putin help, so long as Nord Stream 2 remains locked in regulatory limbo? It is clear that there is more capacity in the pipelines which cross Ukraine. However, Moscow is understandably reluctant to pay Kiev more transit fees. More to the point, those pipelines largely connect to legacy gas fields in the Nadym-Pur-Taz (NPT) region in West Siberia, whose capacity is in decline and which must prioritise local needs. Nord Stream 1 and 2 are fed by the new Yamal fields, but with the latter pipeline still closed, then the Russians are constrained in how much extra supply they could provide. Although there are interconnectors between the systems, even if Moscow wanted to send Yamal gas through the Central Route across Ukraine, it is unclear if they could, given that these capillaries are being used for domestic supply. In other words, it’s complex. The politics But no problem is ever so complex that politicians cannot distil it into banal simplifications and crude rhetoric. Especially when public opinion is becoming increasingly demanding, a scapegoat is always a good distraction, and these days there is no scapegoat better than a Russian one. (A scapebear?) There seem to be three main reasons for the unusually crude “analysis” being deployed over the gas crisis, each of which has a particularly problematic impact on policy, which is why this is more than just a jeremiad against crass Western political headline-chasing. Nonetheless, that lazy and self-interested search for an external excuse is certainly one of those factors. The particular problem with lazy explanations is that they often lead to lazy — and that means expensive and/or fruitless — policy responses. Talk of creating a European strategic gas reserve, for example, would be expensive and politically complex, and take years, all of which mean it would have no impact on the current situation. However, it can get much more political traction by being securitised, presented as a way of “defending” Europe against Putin's “energy weapon.” The second is that the Nord Stream 2 issue has become about much more than the pipeline but a tribal divide over the place of Russia in the world. Whether or not some of the pipelines' foes were also motivated by interests in LNG, whether selling it or receiving it, this has assumed a significance out of all proportion to the actual pipeline. Those who claim that it would somehow make Europe more dependent on Russia's “energy weapon” fail to explain quite how. Yes, it would allow Gazprom to send as little as it could through the Ukrainian pipes and thus minimize payments to Kiev, which is undoubtedly (and no doubt intentionally) bad for the Ukrainians, but it would hardly affect how much Russian gas Europe consumes. If anything, it might actually increase the EU's energy security. Although the days of Moscow turning off the gas are likely gone – the Russians cannot afford to go without the income — when Europe has suffered in the past, it was essentially as collateral, caught by the Kremlin's dispute with Kiev. Yet while Putin might be willing to play hardball with Ukraine, he would likely think twice before trying to do the same with Germany. It is worth noting that Angela Markel has been very bullish that further sanctions would result from any Russian efforts to “weaponize” the pipeline. Thus an essentially emotional campaign against Nord Stream 2 limits Europe's energy options and keeps prices high, in a last-ditch bid to punish Gazprom and the Kremlin (and, implicitly, Germany). Quite who is weaponising gas here? Thirdly, the easy assumption that whenever Russia is involved “hybrid war” and “malign influence” come in its wake, while understandable, always risks spiralling into a vicious circle. Touchy, acutely aware of its relative weaknesses and forever seeing subtle plots in Western blunders, the Kremlin tends to respond badly to overheated political rhetoric. One of the great virtues of Joe Biden's handling of Putin at the Geneva summit was to keep the tough talking to the private session, while treating Russia with respect in public. This may sound trivial, but policies are decided by people, and the ageing lords of the Kremlin take language seriously. Meanwhile, the risk is that at home, such rhetoric locks Western governments into futile and counter-productive gestures. Already I am aware of at least a couple of European foreign ministries brainstorming how to “punish Moscow for creating the gas crisis” just in case their political masters demand it. I asked one of those involved if the team actually believed Russia was to blame. Of course not, came the reply, but you know how politicians are… The wicked problem None of this is to exonerate Moscow for all the destructive and antagonistic things it does do, from poisonings in Britain to trolling in the infosphere. Indeed, to a considerable extent, it is simply reaping the fruits of years of such activities, such that too many, too easily believe too much that goes wrong is somehow down to Russia's unseen and unfriendly hand. However, there are many — analysts, experts, policymakers — who do know better or should know better. In many ways, the gas crisis is a fitting metaphor for the challenges of the modern world: complex, global, hard to fix and likely to have long and unpredictable impacts. The policies of particular countries may exacerbate it a little here, alleviate a little there. Certainly were Germany to approve Nord Stream 2 and other countries then buy gas from Russia — especially on the longer-term contracts it craves — that would help. It wouldn’t magically make the underlying issues disappear, though. The answer to problems of wicked complexity is not to pretend they are simple, not to look for a “usual suspect” to blame. It is to look for solutions of appropriate complexity. At present, for the West, this looks like a fail.

""The decision to withdraw the accreditation of eight members of the Russian delegation to NATO was done based on intelligence because these are undeclared Russian intelligence officers,"" Stoltenberg said. ""We have seen an increase in Russian malign activities, at least in Europe and therefore we need to act."" The NATO chief said that the decision to kick out the Russian representatives was not ""linked to any particular event"" — but gave no more details over the move. NATO announced Wednesday it had decided to strip the ""undeclared Russian intelligence officers"" of official accreditation to the alliance and halve the size of the Russian delegation to 10. Stoltenberg reiterated that the ""relationship between NATO and Russia is at its lowest point since the end of the Cold War. And that's because of the Russian behavior."" Ties between the West and Moscow have slumped in recent years since the Kremlin's 2014 annexation of Crimea and over its involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Russia has long had an observer mission to NATO as part of a two-decade-old NATO-Russia Council meant to promote cooperation in common security areas, but it is not a member of the U.S.-led Alliance. The Kremlin said earlier Thursday that the expulsions showed NATO members have no desire to normalise relations with Moscow. ""There is an obvious contradiction in the statements of NATO representatives about the desire to normalise relations with our country and in real actions,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. The Russian mission has been downsized once before, when seven of its members were ejected after the 2018 poisoning by the Novichok nerve agent on a Russian former double agent, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter in Britain. Accreditation applications by another three Russian diplomats were denied. Meetings of a NATO-Russia council have not been held since 2019 against the backdrop of the heightened tensions. ""We are ready to engage in meaningful dialogue with with Russia, and we are ready also to convene a NATO-Russia Council meeting,"" Stoltenberg said. ""We have actually invited Russia for a long time. So far, Russia has not responded positively."" Sky News reported that NATO's decision came after information was revealed in April about fatal explosions at a Czech ammunition depot in 2014 that Prague says involved two Russian spies — identified as allegedly implicated in the Skripal poisoning. That Czech Republic-Russia incident led to the mutual expulsion of dozens of EU and Russian diplomats and other embassy staff.",1,433,95.95,57.95,34.57,12.9,22.79,32.79,82.22,57.51,46.19,4.85,1.62,0,1.39,0,0.23,0,3.23,15.47,9.47,2.54,17.55,6,2.08,6.24,1.39,11.32,5.54,3.7,7.62,4.16,0.23,3.23,10.62,0.46,10.16,2.31,2.31,0.69,0.69,0.92,3,0,3.93,1.39,2.08,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.55,5.08,1.15,0,0.23,0,3,6,0.23,0,0.23,0.46,8.08,4.62,3.46,0,4.39,0,0,4.39,0,0,0.92,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.23,0.69,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,0.23,0,3.7,8.78,0,1.15,6,0.92,0.23,0.46,4.39,7.39,2.54,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,13.86,4.85,2.31,0,0,0.92,5.77

This is Novaya Gazeta's,” Muratov said after the Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded him and prominent journalist from the Philippines, Maria Ressa, the 2021 Peace Prize. Established in 1993, Novaya Gazeta gained a reputation for hard-hitting journalism on topics including the 2014 downing of flight MH17 and the 2016 Panama Papers leaks into offshore dealings. The paper continued its intrepid work despite the killings of six of its journalists, most notably Anna Politkovskaya in 2006, and threats and harassment of its reporters over the years. Here’s a look at some of Novaya Gazeta’s major investigative reports in recent years, both under Muratov's leadership and otherwise: Chechen anti-LGBT campaign, 2017 and 2019 Novaya Gazeta broke the news in 2017 on the alleged torture and killings of people in southern Russia’s republic of Chechnya who are suspected of being gay. Its reporting has raised international awareness of Chechnya’s alleged anti-gay purges, leading to international legal action brought outside Russian borders. Western-sanctioned Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has denied Novaya Gazeta’s reports of a broad crackdown on LGBT members, claiming that only heterosexuals live in his deeply conservative majority-Muslim region. Extrajudicial killings, 2021 Chechen security officers had also rounded up civilians and summarily executed them in sweeping anti-terror raids around the same time as the gay purges of 2017, Novaya Gazeta reported this year, citing an ex-policeman’s testimony. That report prompted officials in Chechnya, which Kadyrov has ruled with a degree of autonomy in exchange for loyalty to Moscow following two devastating separatist wars in the 1990s, to call for Novaya Gazeta’s closure. Syria mercenary beheading, 2019 Novaya Gazeta linked Russian mercenaries to the gruesome beheading, dismembering and immolation of a Syrian detainee in 2017. The publication withheld the identities of the fighters, believed to be mercenaries for Kremlin-linked private military contractor the Wagner Group, but said it stood ready to provide its materials to Russian law enforcement if they wanted to investigate the torture. The Kremlin has said the footage of the cold-blooded beheading had nothing to do with Russia’s military operations in Syria. Private military companies are illegal in Russia — a technicality that the Kremlin has used to deny Wagner’s reported presence in Syria, Ukraine, Libya, Sudan and other conflict-torn countries. Contract killings, 2018 Novaya Gazeta linked contract killings and attacks on Russian opposition activists and bloggers to U.S.-sanctioned catering magnate Yevgeny Prigozhin, who western journalists have linked to Wagner. The article, which cited interviews with a former Prigozhin associate who has since disappeared, was published days after unknown individuals sent its author, Novaya Gazeta reporter Denis Korotkov, a funeral wreath and a severed goat’s head. Prison torture, 2018 and 2019 Novaya Gazeta finally succeeded in triggering an investigation and a nationwide inspection after it published body cam footage from 2016-17 of prison guards torturing an inmate in the city of Yaroslavl northeast of Moscow.

Long derided as a gastronomic wasteland, Russia's restaurant scene has emerged in recent years from a post-Soviet reputation for blandness, with establishments in Moscow regularly making lists of some of the world's best. Representatives of the Michelin guide — considered the international standard of restaurant rankings — released the first Moscow edition of their iconic red book at a ceremony at Moscow. Sixty-nine restaurants were recommended in all. Two restaurants — Twins Garden run by twin brothers Ivan and Sergei Berezutskiy, and chef Artem Estafev's Artest — were given two stars. Seven restaurants were given one star, including White Rabbit, whose chef Vladimir Mukhin featured in an episode of the Netflix documentary series ""Chef's Table."" None were given three stars — the Holy Grail of the restaurant world. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said at the ceremony that the release of the guide was an important event at a tough time for the restaurant industry. ""It's big moral support in this time of pandemic, when restaurants are having a particularly difficult time,"" he said. Sobyanin said it also showed Russia had rediscovered a food tradition that had suffered under the Soviet Union. ""Unfortunately during the Soviet period these traditions were lost,"" he said. ""I am proud that Moscow's restaurants have become a calling card for our fantastic city."" Michelin's international director Gwendal Poullennec told a press conference that the guide had used an international team of inspectors for its list and there was ""no compromise in our methodology."" Speaking to AFP earlier, he said Russia's food scene had been ""reinventing"" itself since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union. ""There is an evolution of the Russian culinary scene. It is more and more dynamic,"" Poullennec said. He said he was surprised by ""the quality and abundance of produce"" in Moscow restaurants, highlighting in particular the seafood, such as crab and caviar, that are ""exclusive"" elsewhere but in Russia are available at a ""reasonable price."" Russia became the 35th country to have a Michelin guide and Moscow is the first city of the former Soviet Union to be awarded stars. The selection of restaurants will appear in print and also be available via an app in 25 languages, including Russian. Michelin in December said that chefs in Moscow had set themselves apart by highlighting Russian ingredients, including king crab from the Far Eastern city of Vladivostok and smetana, the sour cream used in preparing beef stroganoff. Moscow restaurants have increasingly turned to local ingredients after Western sanctions following Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 resulted in a scarcity of many European foods. A number of restaurants that relied on meat, cheese and fish imported from the West were forced to close, while those that strived to source their ingredients from Russian regions became more competitive. In explaining why it chose Moscow, the guide last year pointed to the ""unique flavors"" of the ""nation's emblematic first courses such as borscht."" Another leading French restaurant guide, Gault et Millau, launched its first Russian edition in 2017. In 2019, Gault & Millau was sold to Russian investors. Twins Garden and White Rabbit have previously featured on the World's 50 Best Restaurants list. Michelin also recently expanded to Beijing, Slovenia and California.",1,560,95.03,53.92,25.34,35.41,20.74,29.11,78.57,56.61,43.57,6.07,2.14,0.18,0.36,0,0.89,0.54,3.93,16.07,8.57,3.39,15,5.89,1.96,4.11,0.36,11.25,7.86,5.54,4.29,1.61,1.61,1.61,4.82,0.54,4.29,0.71,1.61,0,0,0,1.25,0,3.04,1.96,0.89,0.71,0.36,0.18,0,0,0,0,9.11,4.64,1.79,0,0.18,0.18,1.79,3.75,0.18,0,0,1.25,3.04,0.54,2.32,0.18,6.07,3.39,0.36,1.96,0.54,0.36,5.54,0.18,0.18,0,0,0,0,5.36,0,0,0.36,0,0.18,0.18,0,0.36,0,0.18,2.68,11.43,0.18,0.89,9.46,0.89,0,0.18,2.86,7.68,1.61,0.54,0,0,0,0,0,16.43,4.82,4.29,0,0,2.14,5.18
501,themoscowtimes.com,1633503600,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/10/06/who-cares-about-the-pandora-papers-a75227,Who Cares About the Pandora Papers ? - The Moscow Times,English,Russia,"Another massive leak, another multi-national investigation, another slew of allegations of everything from outright corruption and money laundering to legal but ethically problematic tax avoidance and financial engineering. The Pandora Papers, a trove of almost 12 million documents, have shined a light on the activities of over 330 politicians and public officials in more than 90 countries and territories. According to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, Russian nationals are “disproportionately represented,” accounting for 14% of the more than 27,000 named companies. The news is at once dramatic, predictable, and ⁠— alas ⁠— arguably pointless. This no doubt sounds deeply churlish, an offense to the 600-plus journalists from 150 different news outlets including Russia's iStories, who dug into the data for two years, connecting the dots and uncovering the faces behind the anonymous offshore shell companies. The Papers will, one can hope, provide further impetus for efforts in the West to bring meaningful transparency to what is, for all the ritual declarations of politicians, bankers and regulators, still a financial system that offers numerous opportunities for legal avoidance of tax and scrutiny to those able to afford the right lawyers and accountants. The way former British prime minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie sidestepped paying $423,000 property tax by buying a $8,75m building in a posh London neighborhood through an offshore company based in the British Virgin Islands has certainly provided a new focus for criticism both of the couple, but also this particular legal loophole. The Russian Response When it comes to Russia, while a cast of the high and the mighty appear, inevitably media attention has focused on anything that can be linked with Putin, notably allegations about the family of a reputed former girlfriend. That reflects Western media obsessions as much as anything else. But does it really matter?  First of all, the news can be mobilized for political purposes in other ways, too. The relatively innocuous discovery that before his election, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy moved millions of dollars assets into a network of offshores, in collaboration with his aid Serhiy Shefir and present security service chief Ivan Bakanov, has been pounced on with glee not just by his political enemies but also the Russian media. Given his carefully cultivated image as the one honest man in Ukrainian politics, the impression of impropriety ⁠— even if everything he did was legal ⁠— is a problem. Secondly, the very scale of the revelations dilutes their impact by contributing to the sense ⁠— not entirely inaccurate ⁠— that everyone with power and money is much the same. That said, Beijing’s magnates and politicians are surprisingly absent, not least given the ample evidence there is of systemic corruption in China. Likewise, there is a dearth of Americans, and the notion that they never abuse financial loopholes does rather stretch credulity. No wonder that Russian sources also rush to portray this as a strategic leak by the US intelligence community intended to undermine the Kremlin. It has to be said, though, that this would seem to be a rather scattershot and slow-motion attack. Would Washington really also embarrass so many allies in the quest to air some dirty Russian laundry? In any case, while individuals may be turning to their lawyers and PR consultants, how much real impact will this have? The sorry truth would seem to be that by now no one is either surprised nor mobilized by these kind of revelations. Do any Russians really presume that these people weren't fiddling the books? Will it comes as a shock that, for example, Sergei Chemezov, CEO of Russian state defence conglomerate Rostec, has a superyacht registered through an offshore? They are probably more surprised that he does not moor it at a secret Pacific island hideaway populated by genetically-engineered unicorns. The Navalny dilemma This is not just about the Pandora Papers, although they do seem to demonstrate that more is not always better, it also speaks to a fundamental political challenge facing Team Navalny.  Their 'He's not Dimon to you' video had the virtue of dismantling Dmitry Medvedev's reputation as being one of the few honest figures in the regime. 'Putin's Palace' was not just their first direct attack on the monarch, it had a voyeuristic “cribs of the rich and famous” dimension. I suspect many watched not for the forensic analysis of the financing but the pole-dance hookah bar. Where do you, can you, go from there? It is all very well going after Sergei Lavrov, and other boyars, but there is surely a law of diminishing returns. Once there is a general assumption that everyone is a crook and a thief, then further revelations may enthuse your base, but are hardly likely to expand it. As pollsters put it, that is already 'priced in' to people's political decision-making. A lot of journalists can justly congratulate themselves on some serious work. Hopefully, campaigners will be able to use the latest revelations to push for serious regulatory changes. But for Russia, the likelihood that this is a one-week wonder, at best. Unlike Pandora's box, there's unlikely to be Hope at the bottom.",1,849,76.96,32.76,17.98,26.39,23.58,28.5,83.51,64.19,53.24,8.24,2.59,0.12,0,0.47,0.94,0.94,5.65,18.26,9.07,2.36,13.9,7.54,5.89,6.36,1.77,11.07,8.36,5.3,5.89,0.82,1.18,4,15.67,1.53,13.9,2.71,1.18,1.3,3.18,1.41,4.48,0,4.36,2.24,1.77,1.3,0.71,0.12,0,0,0,0,8.72,4.48,0.82,0.24,0.59,0.94,0.82,4.59,0.12,0.12,0.24,1.06,3.65,2.36,1.18,0.12,4.71,0,0.24,2.71,1.88,0.24,0.35,0,0,0,0,0.12,0.12,0,0,0,0.35,0.12,0.24,0.12,0,0.24,0.35,0.59,2.12,7.18,0.82,1.3,4.59,0.82,0.12,0.12,2.12,2.36,4.48,1.65,0,0,0,0,0,14.37,3.53,6.6,0.71,0,1.88,1.65

Footage published on the Ukrainian armed forces’ Facebook page showed the Bayraktar TB2k targeting and shooting a Soviet-era howitzer it identified as the pro-Russian forces’ D-30. The Ukrainian armed forces accused the separatists of wounding one soldier and killing another with the D-30 near the eastern town of Hranitne on the front line. “Bayraktar was used in order to force the enemy to cease fire,” the Ukrainian armed forces’ general staff said in a statement. “After that, the shelling of Ukrainian positions stopped.” The drone strike did not inflict any military or civilian casualties, Russia’s Interfax news agency quoted an unnamed source in the self-proclaimed, separatist-held Donetsk People’s Republic as saying Wednesday. The neighboring separatist-held Luhansk People’s Republic accused Kiev of using the Bayraktar in violation of ceasefire agreements that ban the deployment of foreign drones on the front line. Tuesday’s drone strike is the first since Turkey delivered the first batch of Bayraktar TB2 to Ukraine in July. The Turkish private company Baykar, which produces the armed drones, describes the TB2 model as a ""medium altitude long endurance tactical unmanned aerial vehicle capable of conducting intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and armed attack missions"" with a range of up to 27 hours. Media reports said Kiev plans to buy around 50 Bayraktar TB2 drones, a flagship model that has been used in conflicts against Russian proxies in Syria, Libya and the Nagorno-Karabakh region at the center of a decades-long dispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Ukraine and Turkey signed a memorandum in late September to establish a joint training and maintenance center for the drones in Ukraine. This month, Ukraine’s foreign minister said it plans to build a factory to produce Bayraktar drones in the country. The sale of drones to Kiev places Ankara in a delicate position, as Turkey also cooperates in the defense sector with Russia, Ukraine's rival. The Kremlin said Wednesday that Turkey’s supply of drones to Ukraine risks destabilizing the eastern Ukraine conflict despite Moscow’s “special” relations with Ankara. The Ukrainian army has been locked in a long-running conflict with separatist fighters in Donetsk and Luhansk since 2014 after Moscow annexed the peninsula of Crimea from Kiev. The conflict has claimed more than 13,000 lives. Ukraine and its Western allies accuse Russia of sending troops and arms to support the separatists, which Moscow denies.

Both Moscow and Kiev claimed ownership of the Scythian treasures dating back to the 2nd century B.C., which were loaned to Amsterdam’s Allard Pierson Museum. The museum’s “Crimea: Gold and Secrets of the Black Sea” exhibit opened in February 2014, one month before Russia seized the Black Sea peninsula from Ukraine. The Amsterdam Court of Appeal sided with Kiev and ruled that the collection of more than 2,000 items should be returned to Ukraine, the Dutch broadcaster NOS reported. “Although the objects originate in Crimea,” the judge said, according to a video posted by Russia’s state-run RIA Novosti news agency, “they are part of Ukraine’s heritage after it became independent in 1991.” According to RIA Novosti, the judge said her ruling is subject to appeal with the Netherlands’ supreme court. A lawyer for the Russian-held Crimean museums told RIA Novosti they have three months to appeal the ruling, in which case deliberations could last another year. Russian lawmakers and Crimean museum directors were quick to condemn the Dutch court ruling, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy vowed to “return Crimea” like it did the Scythian gold. Four Crimean museums launched a joint legal bid seven years ago to force the Allard Pierson Museum to return the historic collection of archaeological artefacts dubbed the ""Scythian Gold"" to the peninsula. The impressive collection spans the 2nd century BC to the late medieval era, when Crimea was at the crossroads of ancient trade routes through an area dominated by the Scythian people. A lower court said in 2016 that the treasures were part of Ukraine's cultural heritage and must be returned instead to Kiev, adding that Crimea was not considered a sovereign state. The Crimean museums appealed against the judgement, saying the artifacts belonged there, and the Dutch court of appeal said in 2019 that it needed more time to decide on the matter. The treasures themselves have remained in ""safe storage"" in the Allard Pierson museum, which is the archaeological museum of the University of Amsterdam, pending the appeal.

The country of 2.6 million people wedged between Romania and Ukraine gets gas from Russia via its pro-Russian separatist region of Transnistria and Ukraine. Gazprom has hiked prices from $550 per thousand cubic meters last month to $790 this month – a level Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Spinu said was ""not justified and not realistic"" for Europe's poorest country. ""We face a critical situation,"" Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita said Friday. She told parliament Moldova would be seeking supplies from EU countries and thanked Romania and Ukraine for already supplying some gas. While Gazprom and its daughter company Moldovagaz last month agreed to extend their existing contract for supplies until Oct. 31, Gavrilita said Moldovagaz ""is not keeping its word."" The company is not providing the required volumes of natural gas, she said, with Moldova receiving a third less than usual for October. The prime minister said Moldova and Gazprom were continuing negotiations but that the ex-Soviet country has ""no confidence"" in the success of the talks and ""must take action"" or be ""left without gas."" The month-long state of emergency gives Moldovan utility company Energocom the power to secure gas from other countries. The country's gas shortages come amid skyrocketing gas prices that some in Europe have blamed on Moscow not providing additional supplies to put pressure on the continent. Some experts say Russia has boosted prices as pressure on Moldova for electing a pro-European president in Maia Sandu last year, who has said she wants to fold the breakaway region of Transnistria back into Moldova.

The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe’s (OSCE) said Sunday that groups of armed men prevented members of its mission from exiting the hotel in the separatist-controlled city of Horlivka.

Restriction of access to and from the Office should be considered a violation of such immunities and privileges,” the OSCE mission statement said. Reuters reported Monday that protesters had left the Horlivka hotel after negotiations with the OSCE mission. The news agency identified the captured separatist fighter as officer Andrei Kosyak, who was detained near the front line last Wednesday. Ukraine says Kosyak was a Russian citizen carrying out an undercover reconnaissance mission for the separatists, but the pro-Moscow separatists say he was helping to oversee the ceasefire mediated by France and Germany, according to Reuters. The OSCE/SMM said in a later statement that it was able to conduct a patrol of the conflict zone on Monday afternoon after a padlock and chain had been removed from the hotel gates. Its monitors were still prevented from observing the conflict at two checkpoints in the separatist-controlled Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the OSCE/SMM said Tuesday. The OSCE established and has expanded the eastern Ukraine monitoring mission since the deadly conflict between government forces and pro-Russian separatists broke out in March 2014.

Restriction of access to and from the Office should be considered a violation of such immunities and privileges,” the OSCE mission statement said. Reuters reported Monday that protesters had left the Horlivka hotel after negotiations with the OSCE mission. The news agency identified the captured separatist fighter as officer Andrei Kosyak, who was detained near the front line last Wednesday. Ukraine says Kosyak was a Russian citizen carrying out an undercover reconnaissance mission for the separatists, but the pro-Moscow separatists say he was helping to oversee the ceasefire mediated by France and Germany, according to Reuters. The OSCE/SMM said in a later statement that it was able to conduct a patrol of the conflict zone on Monday afternoon after a padlock and chain had been removed from the hotel gates. Its monitors were still prevented from observing the conflict at two checkpoints in the separatist-controlled Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the OSCE/SMM said Tuesday. The OSCE established and has expanded the eastern Ukraine monitoring mission since the deadly conflict between government forces and pro-Russian separatists broke out in March 2014. Earlier in October, Russian, French and German leaders agreed to work toward arranging a face-to-face meeting of leaders to discuss the conflict.",1,296,98.55,52.15,60.56,7.88,24.67,37.84,75.68,47.3,40.88,4.39,1.69,0,0,0,0.34,1.01,2.7,15.2,11.49,1.01,15.54,4.39,0.34,5.41,0,8.11,3.38,0.68,6.76,1.35,0.68,4.73,5.74,0,5.74,1.01,1.01,0.34,0.34,0,2.36,0,3.38,1.01,2.36,0.34,0.34,0,0,0,0,0,11.82,7.09,1.01,0,2.36,0,4.39,4.39,0,0,0,0.68,2.7,1.01,1.69,0,3.72,0,0,3.72,0,0,1.01,0.68,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.34,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.69,0,1.69,11.82,0.34,0.34,11.15,0,0,0,5.41,5.74,1.35,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.18,4.05,2.7,0,0,1.01,5.41

Moldova declared a 30-day state of emergency on Friday in an effort to secure the ex-Soviet country cheaper natural gas from Europe after Moscow — its traditional supplier — raised prices. Gazprom's Sergei Kupriyanov said Chisinau owed the company $709 million (610 million euros). Moldova's contract with Gazprom ran out in September, but Kupriyanov said the pair were able to ""meet half way"" and extend a contract for October. ""If payment for gas supplies is not fully paid and a contract is not signed from December, then Gazprom will halt gas supplies to Moldova,"" he told Interfax. The country of 2.6 million people wedged between Romania and Ukraine gets gas from Russia via its pro-Russian separatist region of Transnistria and Ukraine. Gazprom this month hiked prices more than 40% to $790 per thousand cubic meters from $550 — a level Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Spinu said was ""not justified and not realistic"" for Europe's poorest country. Despite the contract being extended, Moldovan Prime Minster Natalia Gavrilita said on Friday the country was receiving a third less natural gas than usual for October. ""We face a critical situation,"" she said. She told parliament Moldova would be seeking supplies from EU countries and thanked Romania and Ukraine for already providing some gas. The month-long state of emergency, which will last until Nov. 20, gives Moldovan utility company Energocom the powers to secure gas from other countries.

Defense Chief Heads to Black Sea Region",English,Russia,"U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin headed to the Black Sea region Sunday aiming to shore up alliances with countries pressured by Russia and show gratitude for their contributions to the two-decade war in Afghanistan. Austin will visit Georgia, Romania and Ukraine before taking part in the in-person defense ministers summit at NATO in Brussels on October 21-22. ""We are reassuring and reinforcing the sovereignty of countries that are on the front lines of Russian aggression,"" a senior U.S. defense official told reporters ahead of the trip. All three countries are in the NATO orbit — Romania a full member and Georgia and Ukraine partner states. All three also sit on the rim of the Black Sea, where Russia has sought to expand its own influence and prevent expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the US-European alliance. Russia has occupied Ukraine's Crimea and has troops stationed in Georgia's breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. And Kiev is battling pro-Russian separatists in the country's east, in a conflict that has cost 13,000 lives. In June Russian forces menaced Dutch and British warships as they sailed near Crimea. Austin will also extend thanks to its partners for their contributions, and significant losses, as part of coalition forces in Afghanistan over two decades, before the hasty U.S. exit this year that ceded the country to the Taliban. ""We are going to be showing recognition and appreciation for the sacrifices and the commitments of our partners and allies,"" the official said. In Georgia, Austin will meet with Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili and Minister of Defense Juansher Burchuladze, with a key aim to keep up defense cooperation as a three-year U.S. Army training program expires this year. Georgia hopes Austin's visit will help advance its case for becoming a full NATO member. It will be ""another clear message from the U.S. in support of Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, its stable and democratic development, and for the country's Euro-Atlantic goals"" Foreign Minister David Zalkaliani said Wednesday. ""We expect that meetings will be focused on further deepening our cooperation, regional security issues, and the process of Georgia's NATO integration,"" he said. In Ukraine, Austin will have talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky and Minister of Defense Andriy Taran, both of whom visited Washington at the beginning of September to press their case for NATO membership with President Joe Biden. And in Romania, he will see President Klaus Iohannis and Minister of National Defense Nicolae-Ionel Ciuca, amid a fresh political crisis in the country. In all three, the United States wants to expand defense support but also sees problems of democratic development and corruption. In Georgia, tens of thousands of protestors were out in the streets this week over the arrest of ex-president and opposition leader Mikheil Saakashvili and over allegations of fraud in recent elections. Ukraine is under heavy pressure from the West, which provides the country extensive aid, to halt rampant graft. ""It is our belief that strengthening democratic institutions creates greater resilience against Russian influence and external manipulation,"" the U.S. official said. ""Our bilateral assistance is actually very much focused on the specific aspects of institutional reform that are necessary for NATO. And that applies to both Georgia and to Ukraine."" Austin will end the week at NATO headquarters in Brussels, where ties with the U.S., frayed by the previous administration of Donald Trump, took a fresh hit last month when Washington unexpectedly announced a new pact with Australia and Britain focused on China in the Indo-Pacific region. The US official said Austin would reinforce U.S. commitment to the pact and press for military adaptation to address future threats.

Russia’s Foreign Ministry accused Ukrainian forces of detaining ceasefire observer Andrei Kosyak last Wednesday and failing to inform Moscow via diplomatic channels within an allotted three-day period. Ukraine says Kosyak was a Russian citizen carrying out an undercover reconnaissance mission for the separatists. “We call on Ukraine to… stop provocations on the contact line in Donbass, report the location of Russian citizen [Andrei] Kosyak and grant Russian consular staff access to him,” spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. Russian-backed separatists in the Donbass — the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk regions in southeastern Ukraine — have been locked in a 7-year war with Ukrainian forces that has killed some 13,000 people, according to a United Nations tally. “We regard Ukraine’s actions as treacherous and provocative,” Zakharova said in a statement on the Foreign Ministry’s website. Separatist-controlled Luhansk’s de-facto leader Leonid Pasechnik had identified Kosyak as the breakaway region’s “officer” who was overseeing the ceasefire during road clearing work when he was captured. Zakharova urged Europe’s main security body, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), to give a “principled assessment” of Kosyak’s detention. Protests demanding Kosyak’s release temporarily suspended the OSCE conflict monitoring mission’s work in separatist-controlled Horlivka in recent days. The mission continued after the protesters had left the Horlivka hotel housing its observers, Reuters reported Monday.

Spinu's government has declared a state of emergency and imported gas from outside Russia – its Soviet-era master – for the first time in its history after Gazprom hiked prices for the impoverished country. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday's talks will have an ""absolutely commercial nature."" ""There is no politicization here and there cannot be,"" he said.

Last week, Russian media reported that Gazprom is threatening to cut the country off if it does not settle its debts and sign a new contract by December. Before heading to Russia, Spinu said he will demand ""transparent and fair prices"" from Gazprom at the talks. Wedged between Romania and Ukraine, the country of 2.6 million receives gas from Russia via its pro-Moscow separatist region of Transnistria and Ukraine.

But on Friday both sides announced they had agreed to extend their previous agreement by five years, with deliveries to start from November 1. ""The parties reached an agreement on the price formula, the audit of the Moldova-Gaz debt and on subsequent dialogue for repayments,"" Moldovan foreign ministry spokesman Daniel Voda said in a statement. Gazprom said in a separate statement that the extension was made on ""mutually beneficial terms"". The agreement was reached after talks in Saint Petersburg, where Gazprom has its headquarters, between Moldova's Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Spinu and the Russian state-controlled firm's CEO Alexei Miller. Wedged between Romania and Ukraine, Moldova has traditionally received gas from Russia via its pro-Moscow separatist region of Transnistria and through Ukraine. But Moldova's contract with Gazprom expired in September. Gazprom extended the contract until the end of October but raised prices, which Spinu said at the time was ""not justified and not realistic"" for Europe's poorest country. As well as declaring a state of emergency, Moldova signed a contract to buy natural gas from Poland -- the first time it has turned to a supplier other than Russia. Voda on Friday said that Moldova ""received insufficient volumes of gas from Gazprom based on the one-month extension of the expired contract with a three-fold price increase"". He said the Gazprom deal had been extended ""for another five years based on the price formula proposed by the Moldovan side"", but did not give further details about prices. Europe is in the throes of an energy crisis with gas prices soaring to record highs as economies come back online after the end of pandemic lockdowns and renewables like solar and wind see a slowdown in supplies. Critics in Western capitals blame Russia for the price hikes, saying Moscow is not upping deliveries to pressure Europe to agree more long-term contracts and for the certification of the recently completed controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Some have also accused Moscow of raising prices for Moldova after the election last year of pro-European President Maia Sandu. For its part, Moscow accused Moldova or being late on payments and had threatened to turn off the tap entirely. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell on Thursday accused Russia of using gas as a ""geopolitical weapon"". The Kremlin said that the gas talks were ""exclusively commercial"" and denied any political pressure was involved.",1,449,98.04,23.54,51.04,7.97,24.94,30.51,74.83,55.01,42.32,3.12,0.89,0,0,0,0.22,0.67,2.23,13.36,9.35,1.34,17.37,4.23,1.56,6.24,0.89,8.91,4.68,5.57,2.9,0.22,0.22,2.45,6.24,0.45,5.79,0.22,1.11,0,0.45,0.22,4.01,0,3.12,0.89,2.23,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.57,5.35,0,0,0.89,0.89,3.12,1.78,0,0,0,0.45,2.23,1.56,0.45,0.22,7.35,0.67,0,3.12,3.34,0.22,0.22,0.22,0.22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.67,0,0.89,0.22,0.22,0,0.22,0.45,0,4.01,7.8,0,1.78,6.46,0.22,0,0,6.01,6.68,2.23,0.22,0.22,0,0.22,0,0,13.36,4.01,2.9,0,0,0.89,5.57

The Russian president enjoys the approval of 67% of Russian respondents despite weeks of record Covid-19 infections and deaths that the authorities have largely pinned on slow vaccination uptake. Putin ordered a nationwide partial lockdown from Oct. 30-Nov. 7 in a bid to slow the virus’ spread after placing most Covid-19 response decisions in the hands of regional leaders for much of the pandemic. His October approval ratings are up from 64% in September and 61% in August, Levada said. Despite the increase, Putin's approval has yet to return to the high levels seen following Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, as unpopular pension reforms and lagging living standards have fueled public discontent. Russia’s lower-house State Duma has also seen a slight boost in its approval ratings as well as the ruling, pro-Kremlin United Russia party, which increased its rating slightly to 29% from 26% in July. The results follow last month’s State Duma elections that saw United Russia claim a decisive win amid widespread reports of electoral fraud and the blocking of most opposition candidates from the ballot. According to the poll, 48% of Russians believe that the country is headed in the right direction and 43% think the country is on the wrong path. Last week, Levada published a separate poll finding that nearly half of Russians say they don’t hold democratic values.

""We respect this body, but no one can make us respect such decisions,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, referring to the European Parliament.  On Wednesday, the European Parliament awarded its Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to President Vladimir Putin's best-known domestic opponent.  Peskov said the decision ""significantly devalues the meaning"" of words like freedom of thought.  The 45-year-old opposition politician last year survived a poisoning attack with Novichok nerve agent that he blames on the Kremlin.  After returning to Russia in January from Germany, where he was treated, he was arrested and convicted on old embezzlement charges. He is now serving a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence in a penal colony outside Moscow.  His winning the Sakharov Prize, backed by parliament's main political groups, will further embitter ties between the European Union and Russia that have been in crisis since the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.

NATO this month stripped eight Russian mission members of their accreditations, accusing them of secretly working as intelligence officers. “We are suspending the work of our official mission to NATO, including the work of our military representative from Nov. 1 or it could take a few more days,” the state-run TASS news agency quoted Lavrov as saying to reporters. Russia will also close the Western military bloc’s liaison mission — established in 2002 and hosted at the Belgian Embassy — and information bureau in Moscow, Lavrov said. ""NATO is not interested in any equitable dialogue or in any joint work. If this is so, then we do not see a great need to continue to pretend that any changes are possible in the foreseeable future,"" he said. He said that in case of urgent matters, NATO could liaise via the Russian Ambassador in Belgium. According to Lavrov, Russia notified NATO of its actions in advance. Tensions between Moscow and NATO have remained at their highest levels since the Cold War in the years following Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. Russia has long had an observer mission to NATO as part of a two-decade-old NATO-Russia Council meant to promote cooperation in common security areas, but it is not a member of the U.S.-led Alliance.

The company did not book any additional capacity on pipelines running through Ukraine to the EU for the month, and ordered just a third — 31 million cubic meters per day — of the space on the Yamal pipeline running through Belarus and Poland. The decision caused gas prices in Europe to fluctuate in trading Tuesday and Wednesday. Spot prices for natural gas in Europe are trading near record highs amid concerns over low storage, a possible cold winter, and weak performance of renewable sources over the summer. Russia has been blamed for holding back on supplies and seeking to use the situation to secure fast track approval for its controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia is ready to provide more gas to the continent. Gazprom says supplies to the EU are running near record volumes over the course of the year and that it was prioritizing refilling Russia’s own gas storage facilities ahead of the winter, resulting in a 30% increase in supply to the Russian market. But with that process due to be completed by the end of October, the refusal to book additional capacity on pipelines to Europe for November looks set to prolong Europe’s gas price crisis and trigger fresh criticism of the Russian energy giant. “This could signal that Gazprom will not increase exports to Europe,” said Mitch Jennings, senior analyst at Sova Capital. European gas storage facilities are only 77% full — compared to 95% this time last year, analysts at Sova Capital highlighted in a research note Tuesday. Gazprom’s own data shows gas supplies to Europe dropped in October. Gazprom had been booking up to 15 million cubic meters of additional capacity through Ukraine earlier this year, Reuters reported. But since the completion of Nord Stream 2, Moscow has been pushing European regulators to approve the pipeline, which it says could start sending gas under the Baltic Sea to Germany almost immediately. Russia has said Europe is to blame for the gas crisis across the continent, pointing to the liberalization of the market in favor of short-term contracts, instead of the long-term multi-year deals Gazprom wants to strike with European customers. Gazprom’s share price has soared amid rising prices for its main product, with the company trading up 60% over the last six months.",1,416,99,31.97,40.73,8.87,27.73,30.77,77.16,55.77,41.11,2.64,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.64,12.02,8.41,3.13,19.47,4.81,1.44,2.4,0.48,9.86,6.73,7.69,3.61,0.48,0.24,2.88,5.29,0,5.29,0.24,1.44,0.72,0.72,0,1.68,0,2.64,0.72,1.92,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.57,3.37,0.24,0,0.72,0.48,1.2,0.72,0,0,0,0,1.92,0.24,1.68,0,6.73,0,0,4.81,2.88,0,0.24,0.24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.48,0.24,0,0,0.72,0,0.24,0.72,0.24,2.64,10.34,0.24,1.92,7.69,0.24,0,0.24,6.01,3.37,3.61,1.2,0,0,0,0,0,10.34,3.61,3.61,0,0,0.96,2.16

Drop to the floor!” Feeling anxious, she and her officemate cautiously checked what was happening. The noise was coming from a large conference room where a film about the catastrophic famine in early 1930’s Soviet Ukraine was screening. They saw two dozen thugs blocking the screen, chanting “shame!,” “fascists!,” and “get out of here!” Memorial’s staff called the police, but by the time the officers arrived most of the intruders dispersed, and police led away the three who remained. Several Memorial representatives went to the district police precinct to give testimony. Then, without explanation, the police blocked the activists and anyone else in Memorial’s building from leaving. They held them there for hours, late into the night, forcing everyone to submit a written “explanation” before they could leave. “At first, we did not understand we were being locked in. We actually continued with the screening after the thugs left.” Orlova said. “But then at around 9 p.m. I decided to call it a day. I went to the staff exit — and saw a police officer blocking the door. I told him I had a long commute ahead of me and I needed to leave — and he refused to let me out.” Uniformed and plain clothes police blocked the front entrance, she said. Supporters of Memorial who heard about the intruders had come, despite pouring rain, to offer support, but the police forced them to stay outside. “This went on for hours.” Memorial activists kept trying to get the police officers to explain what was happening and why, but could not get a coherent response. Finally, police said that everyone would be allowed to leave only if they provided a written statement describing the event itself, the intrusion and providing full passport details, residential address, phone number, as well as information about their education, workplace, and work title. “I said I won’t be doing any such thing without a lawyer present,” Orlova said. In fact, members of their legal team stood outside, but police had blocked them from entering. More time went by. A plain clothes officer who was apparently in charge demanded to see all of Memorial’s office premises, including work stations. A Memorial activist overheard police talking among themselves, saying they planned to seize some equipment. Fearing that their offices would be arbitrarily searched and documents and electronic devices confiscated, Memorial’s team redoubled their demands to see their lawyers. Meanwhile, the officers guarding the staff entrance apparently walked away, and, to ensure the door remained blocked, locked it with a pair of handcuffs from the outside. An image of the handcuffed door was widely shared on social media, contributing to public and media outcry. Exasperated, one of Memorial’s legal team members gained entry to the building through an open window and confronted the police, who eventually allowed two lawyers into the building. At 2 a.m. the police finally left, taking Memorial’s DVR with them, despite the fact that Memorial had earlier provided them with complete footage of the evening. When thanking Memorial supporters and independent media, the head of Memorial, Yan Rachinsky, said that without their support the story could have had a “different [worse] ending.” He also noted that while the thuggish attempt to disrupt the screening cost Memorial 20-30 minutes the police interference did more damage, costing them close to “seven hours and a DVR,” not to mention the stress. For years, the Russian government has smeared Memorial as a “foreign agent,” and repeatedly fined the group under this abusive legislation. And it’s not the first time pseudo-patriotic thugs have targeted Memorial, and each time, police do little, if anything, to stop them. And although police showed up last night, one has to wonder what message they were sending when they block everyone inside the building. Memorial stands up for human rights and provides a platform for free debate and artistic expression. The image of police handcuffs locking the organization’s door is an indelible symbol of the vicious crackdown on fundamental freedoms by Russian authorities, currently sweeping across the country.  Maybe that was the message.",1,707,88.52,61.9,47.84,12.78,17.24,27.86,86.7,62.94,49.65,9.19,6.22,1.27,0.42,0,0.99,2.97,2.97,14.71,10.04,2.26,14.43,4.95,4.1,6.22,0.71,13.58,4.81,3.82,8.06,1.56,0.85,5.66,7.78,0.57,7.21,1.41,0.85,0.99,1.27,0.14,2.83,0,2.4,0.85,1.56,0.99,0,0.99,0.42,0.14,0,0,14.57,6.65,0.99,0.14,0.28,0.42,3.96,8.06,0,0,0.57,0.42,1.7,0.85,0.42,0.42,3.68,0.42,0.57,2.4,0.28,0,2.83,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.4,0.42,0,0.71,0.14,0.28,0,0.14,0,0.14,4.38,12.16,0.42,2.4,7.36,1.27,0.85,0.14,4.53,7.36,0.85,0.85,0,0,0,0,0,19.38,5.8,7.21,0,0.71,1.41,4.24

The statement came hours before a government official said Tuesday that Ukraine's Defense Minister Andriy Taran had resigned — reportedly on health grounds. Taran, who had led the ministry since March 2020, has not commented on his resignation, a decision which parliament must ratify amid reports of an impending wider cabinet reshuffle. The 66-year-old Taran ""has complaints about his health,"" the leader of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's faction in parliament, Davyd Arakhamiia, told reporters. Opponents had criticized him during his tenure, citing insufficient reform of an under-resourced military.

But Ukraine's defense ministry said in a statement late Monday that ""no additional deployment"" of Russian forces had been observed. The videos could comprise ""special informational and psychological actions"" and show a planned troop movement after a Russian military exercise, it added. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Tuesday he had discussed the conflict with U.S. President Joe Biden on the sidelines of the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow. ""The U.S. continues to support territorial integrity and reforms in Ukraine,"" Zelenskiy tweeted. Zelenskiy also had a more formal meeting in Glasgow with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who ""reaffirmed the United States' unwavering support for Ukraine's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity,"" a State Department statement said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday dismissed the reports of a potential buildup, saying there was no need to ""waste time"" on ""low-quality"" claims. ""The movement of our military equipment and army units... is exclusively our business,"" he told reporters. ""Russia has never threatened anyone."" The Ukrainian army is locked in a simmering conflict with pro-Russian separatists that erupted after Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014. After a rise in violence early this year, Russia in March amassed around 100,000 troops on Ukraine's borders, sparking fears of a major escalation. Under pressure from Kiev's Western allies, Moscow later announced a pullback, but both Ukraine and the United States said at the time the withdrawal was limited. Ukraine's military said Tuesday one of its soldiers had been killed in a separatist attack. The conflict has claimed more than 13,000 lives to date.

Russia has been mustering military units on its border with Ukraine this month, in moves the EU on Friday called ""rather worrying,"" as the long-running standoff between the two becomes more unpredictable. But although the buildup comes amid unusually high tensions between Russia and the West, exacerbated by suspicions of Moscow’s involvement in Belarus’s migration crisis, U.S. navy exercises in the Black Sea, and Europe’s gas supply crisis, analysts in Russia and abroad are cautious to draw conclusions about an imminent Russian attack. “To be quite honest, I don’t see any grounds to expect an invasion,” said Andrei Kortunov, head of the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC), a Kremlin-aligned think tank. ""I don’t know what it would achieve. The losses would be huge, and the potential gains very limited."" For several weeks now, a steady trickle of information has appeared to suggest a return to hostilities in a conflict that has been mostly dormant in the seven years since Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula and reportedly sponsored a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s Russian-speaking east. Footage purporting to show Russian military hardware being moved towards Ukraine has been widely shared on social media. Meanwhile, satellite imagery of military deployments along the western frontier with Ukraine and Belarus — where separate armed exercises have been seen as a statement of political support for embattled Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko — appears to show a Russian army getting ready to move. According to Ukrainian government estimates, 114,000 Russian military personnel are now deployed in close proximity to Ukraine’s northern, southern and eastern borders. In many ways, the development resembles an earlier buildup of Russian forces in March and April this year, which sparked speculation of an imminent assault, before the troops were suddenly pulled back. Against this backdrop, Bloomberg has reported that U.S. officials have briefed European counterparts on a possible Russian assault on Ukraine. Rob Lee, a Eurasia fellow at U.S. think tank the Foreign Policy Research Institute said he doubts Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to conduct a large-scale invasion of Ukraine ""He wants to use force, or the threat of force, to get Ukraine and NATO to make concessions."" The recent increase in tensions comes on the back of years of souring ties between Moscow and Kiev. Moscow had once hoped that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a native Russian-speaker from the country’s east, might be amenable to making a deal to end the war that began when Russia-backed separatists seized Ukraine’s eastern Donbass provinces. Instead, Zelenskiy has presided over a steady worsening of relations with Russia since his election in 2019. Pressure on pro-Russian media and politicians in Ukraine, including treason charges against Viktor Medvedchuk, a Ukrainian lawmaker and longtime personal friend of Vladimir Putin, have infected the two sides’ relations with more bitterness than usual. The Minsk Protocol — a 2015 deal on a potential outline to end the war — has been mostly forgotten, with ceasefires broken and low-level fighting continuing. Meanwhile, deepening military cooperation with NATO countries, including the purchase of Turkish Bayraktar military drones earlier this year, has brought things to a head. For Russia, which has long opposed Ukraine’s entry into the U.S.-led military pact, a recent tranche of Western arms supplies and weapons deals for Kiev has raised the prospect of the country moving decisively into the NATO camp. Though formal NATO membership for Ukraine is not an immediate prospect, the Kremlin warned in September that expanding the alliance’s presence in Ukraine would still constitute a crossing of Russia’s so-called ""red lines."" In particular, the issue of drones — which were used to shell Donbass separatist positions for the first time last month — is an emotive one. In last year’s war in the separatist Nagorno-Karabakh enclave, Azerbaijan used Bayraktar drones purchased from Turkey to defeat Armenian forces and achieve a decisive victory in what had been one of the former Soviet Union’s longest running frozen conflicts. Some in Moscow worry that Ukraine may now be looking to build up its arsenals in preparation for a future decisive offensive in the Donbass. ""Zelenskiy might try to become a Ukrainian Aliev,"" said RIAC’s Kortunov, referring to the Azerbaijani president who led his country to victory in Nagorno-Karabakh. However, for many in Moscow, the fear is less of a concrete Ukrainian plan to resolve the Donbass issue than of a broader sense that the seven-year-old frozen conflict is becoming increasingly unpredictable. With Zelenskiy’s approval ratings falling to record lows, some imagine that he might attempt to rally his base by fulfilling pre-election promises to resolve the Donbass conflict ahead of presidential polls scheduled for 2024. Moreover, with a fresh summit between the Russian and American presidents in the works, the Kremlin reportedly worries that Ukraine, if undeterred, may scupper the modest thaw in U.S.-Russia relations since June’s Biden-Putin summit in Geneva. ""The fear in Moscow is that Ukrainian hawks might opt for further provocations to try to pull Russia into a full-scale confrontation,"" said Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of R.Politik, a political analysis firm. In any case, experts stress that the 114,000 Russian personnel allegedly on the border would not be sufficient to defeat Ukraine’s armed forces, estimated at around 255,000. With Ukraine having already resisted a Russian invasion in 2014 — when its army was much weaker — the costs of invading and occupying the country would likely far exceed the military units currently rallied on the Russian side of the border. ""We shouldn’t overestimate the scale of what’s going on at the border,"" said the RIAC’s Kortunov. ""There aren’t enough forces there right now to undertake a serious operation. Right now, this looks like deterrence more than anything.""",1,971,97.31,33.08,57.46,2.93,28.56,35.02,79.51,56.44,43.05,3.91,1.03,0.21,0.1,0,0.62,0,2.88,14.11,9.58,1.54,16.37,5.66,2.99,3.81,0.62,11.12,6.9,4.12,7.72,0.82,1.44,6.08,11.53,0,11.43,1.75,1.85,1.24,2.78,0.1,2.57,0.1,4.33,0.93,3.4,1.13,0.1,1.03,0.62,0.31,0,0,6.39,3.71,0.31,0,1.44,0.31,1.13,2.06,0,0,0,0.62,7.11,4.12,2.68,0.31,1.85,0,0,1.34,0.51,0,0.51,0.21,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.21,0.31,0.51,0.21,0.31,0,0.1,0.51,0.1,3.09,13.08,0.21,1.96,9.78,1.13,0,0.41,4.74,3.91,3.81,2.37,0.1,0.1,0,0,0,16.99,4.63,5.97,0,0,2.37,4.02

Leading  Provocative  Exercises in Black Sea,English,Russia,"Russian President Vladimir Putin told French counterpart Emmanuel Macron on Monday that ""provocative"" U.S.-led exercises in the Black Sea were ""increasing tensions"" between Moscow and NATO, the Kremlin said. Both leaders expressed ""dissatisfaction"" with what Moscow called a ""worsening"" situation in eastern Ukraine, the Kremlin statement said. Putin ""drew attention to the provocative nature of the large scale exercises led by the United States and its allies in the Black Sea which are increasing tensions between Russia and NATO,"" the Kremlin said. Putin's comments came after Western countries raised alarm over Russian military activities near Ukraine. According to the Elysee, Macron told Putin that France was ready to defend Ukraine's territorial integrity. Last week, Putin said that the Kremlin considered recent Black Sea exercises by the U.S. and other NATO ships as a serious challenge. He told state television that Russia's Defense Ministry ""had a proposal to hold its own unplanned exercises in the same waters."" ""But I believe that this is inappropriate and there is no need to further escalate the situation,"" he said. Putin seemingly referred to several U.S. warships taking part in exercises in the Black Sea which Moscow has said it was ""monitoring."" According to the Kremlin statement, Putin also criticized Ukraine for the ""recent use"" of drones in its conflict with pro-Russia rebels. Last month, Kiev released footage of what it said was its first use of the Turkish-made TB2 Bayraktar drone against separatists. Putin said this violates peace agreements signed in Minsk in 2015. U.S. top diplomat Antony Blinken warned Moscow last week against making another ""serious mistake"" on Ukraine as Washington sought clarity about troop movements near the border. The EU has said it was also concerned by Russian military activities close to the border. The 27-nation bloc said it was monitoring the situation with partners, including the U.S. and Britain. The accusations come amid rising tensions between the EU and Moscow over a migrant stand-off on the border between Poland and Kremlin-allied Belarus.

CIA chief William Burns was in Russia for two days of meetings with top officials at the request of President Joe Biden, the U.S. Embassy has said. CNN reported last week that Burns had been sent to Moscow to warn the Kremlin about the alleged build-up of troops near Ukraine's border. It said that after his meetings in Russia, Burns spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy by phone. The Kremlin's spokesman said on Monday that Putin and Burns discussed bilateral ties, ""regional conflicts"" and a crisis in diplomatic relations. He did not provide further details. Burns, who was the U.S. ambassador to Russia in 2005-2008, visited Moscow during a severe crisis in ties between Moscow and Washington. Biden has increased pressure on Putin since becoming U.S. president in January. In May, Russia formally designated the United States an ""unfriendly state."" The Pentagon said last week it was monitoring the situation in Ukraine closely amid reports of a new build-up of Russian troops on the country's border. Publicly, Ukraine has denied reports of a new Russian troop build-up. The Ukrainian army is locked in a simmering conflict with pro-Russian separatists that erupted after Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014. After a rise in violence early this year, Russia in the spring amassed around 100,000 troops on Ukraine's borders, sparking fears of a major escalation.

Capitol Rioter Seeks Asylum in Belarus – State TV,English,Russia,"A man on the FBI’s Most Wanted List for allegedly attacking police during the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot is now seeking asylum in Belarus, the ex-Soviet country’s state-run television reported Sunday. Evan Neumann, 48, is wanted in the United States on charges of violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, as well as for assaulting, resisting and obstructing law enforcement during civil disorder. Neumann denies the charges as “unfounded.” Neumann sold his California home in spring and was thought to have moved to Ukraine to evade arrest, ABC News reported this summer. “Judging by his story, [Neumann] is the same type of simple American whose shops were burned by Black Lives Matter activists,” a Belarus 1 TV channel presenter said, echoing a common talking point on Russian state television. Neumann “sought justice and asked uncomfortable questions” following the 2020 U.S. elections disputed by ex-President Donald Trump, the presenter added, “but lost almost everything and is being persecuted by the U.S. government.” Belarusian border authorities detained Neumann on the border with Ukraine on Aug. 15, Belarus 1 reported. “This situation has not only never happened, but was difficult to imagine,” said the channel’s reporter in a segment titled “Goodbye, America!” In a sit-down interview, Neumann recalled crossing swampy forests and meeting wild hogs and snakes in his journey from Ukraine to Belarus. Belarus 1 reported that Neumann traveled from the U.S. to Italy in March, then took a train to Switzerland and drove to Germany and Poland before settling in western Ukraine, where he had rented an apartment for four months. Neumann said he noticed Ukrainian security services “following” him two weeks into his stay, which prompted him to cross into neighboring Belarus and seek asylum. Belarusian migration authorities declined to comment, citing confidentiality of personal data, the Russian state-run RIA Novosti reported Monday. At least three U.S. citizens have applied for asylum in Belarus so far in 2021, the outlet added. Belarus meanwhile has been accused of orchestrating a wave of migrants and refugees, mainly from the Middle East, toward European Union members' borders in retaliation to EU sanctions. Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko has denied the charges.",1,359,95.31,55,18.07,4.76,21.12,35.38,76.32,50.7,38.16,3.9,2.51,0,0,0,2.23,0,1.39,10.03,6.69,3.06,15.32,4.18,2.51,5.29,0.56,11.7,5.01,2.79,6.41,0.56,0,5.85,5.57,0.56,5.01,1.39,0.28,0.56,0.84,0,1.39,0.28,3.62,0.84,2.79,0.56,0,0.56,0,0.28,0,0,9.75,5.29,0,0.28,1.11,0.84,2.79,4.46,0,0,0,2.51,8.08,5.01,2.23,0.84,5.29,0.84,0.84,2.79,0.84,0,0.56,0.28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.56,0.28,0,0,0,0,0.56,0,1.39,11.42,1.11,1.95,7.8,0.28,0.28,0,3.34,7.24,2.79,0,0,0,0,0,0,21.17,7.24,6.69,0,0.28,1.11,5.85

That brings the agency's tally of Covid-19 deaths in Russia to nearly 450,000, the highest toll in Europe. A Moscow Times analysis places Russia’s excess death toll since the start of the coronavirus pandemic at 723,000. Lockdown in Russia New coronavirus restrictions came into effect across Russia on Saturday with authorities looking to stem soaring infections and deaths in Europe's worst hit country by fatalities. The paid holiday lasts until next Sunday and can be extended if Covid-19 cases do not fall. Russia has held back on imposing significant nationwide measures since ending a short lockdown at the beginning of the pandemic and instead placed its hopes on the rollout of several homegrown vaccines, including Sputnik V.  Sputnik woes Russian President Vladimir Putin complained Saturday about lack of international recognition for its Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine at a G20 summit, where leaders agreed to step up global inoculation efforts. ""This happens mainly because of dishonest competition, protectionism and because some states, especially those of the G20, are not ready for mutual recognition of vaccines and vaccination certificates,"" Putin said in video message comments to counterparts. Not our drone Turkey is not responsible for Ukraine's use of an Ankara-made drone in its conflict with pro-Moscow rebels, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said in comments published on Sunday. ""If a state buys (weaponry) from us, it's no longer a Turkish product. It might be manufactured in Turkey, but it belongs to Ukraine,"" Cavusoglu told reporters after meeting his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, on the margins of the G20 summit in Rome. Ukraine last week said it destroyed the artillery of pro-Russian separatists in the country’s east using a Bayraktar TB2k, its first combat deployment of a Turkish drone. The Kremlin had later said that Ankara’s supply of drones to Kiev risks destabilizing the eastern Ukraine conflict despite Russia’s “special” relations with Turkey. No cheeky matter Police on Saturday detained 31-year-old model Irina Volkova for posing in thong underwear in front of St. Isaac’s Cathedral in St. Petersburg on charges of “insulting religious feelings.” A court, which said the graphic photo dates back to the summer of 2020, ruled Sunday to release Volkova from custody. It added that the model blamed debt collectors for the snapshot online. Her detention came on the heels of Russia's first real prison sentence for “insulting religious feelings,” with a couple convicted for posting a photo in which they simulated oral sex across from St. Basil’s Cathedral on Red Square.

Saakashvili, who served as president between 2004 and 2013, was arrested on Oct. 1 on his return from exile in Ukraine. He has refused food for 39 days to protest against his imprisonment, which he says is politically motivated. His jailing has exacerbated a political crisis that erupted last year after the opposition denounced fraud in parliamentary elections won narrowly by the ruling Georgian Dream party. The guards ""abused me verbally, punched me on the neck, dragged me on the ground by my hair"", Saakashvili said in a letter released through his lawyer, adding that his controversial transfer to a prison hospital was ""aimed at killing"" him. He was moved on Monday to a prison hospital that rights officials say fails to ensure his proper treatment. The flamboyant pro-Western reformer's arrest provoked the largest anti-government demonstrations in a decade. Chanting Saakashvili's name, about 40,000 demonstrators flooded on Monday evening into the central Freedom Square in the Georgian capital Tbilisi, AFP reporters saw. ""A mass, permanent protest movement begins in Georgia and will not stop until Mikheil Saakashvili is set free and snap elections are called,"" Nika Melia, the chairman of Saakashvili's United National Movement party, told the crowd. ""We will not disperse, our protest will be relentless and peaceful, we will not let the regime provoke us to a civil confrontation."" Protesters then marched through downtown Tbilisi towards the prime minister's office, vowing to blockade the building. Prime Minister Irakli ""Garibashvili will not be able to leave or enter his office,"" Melia said. One of the demonstrators, businessman Niko Mgeladze, 46, said: ""Saakashvili is a victim of political vendetta, we will not stop until he is liberated."" The pro-opposition Mtavari TV station aired footage of hundreds of riot police being deployed outside government buildings. On Monday morning, doctors who examined Saakashvili said he was ""at high risk of multi-systemic complications and needs to be urgently treated in a high-tech clinic."" Georgia's rights ombudswoman Nino Lomjaria said the prison hospital failed to meet the doctors' criteria. Doctors have said Saakashvili faces an imminent risk of death as he has an underlying blood disorder that makes his hunger strike particularly dangerous. Ukraine protested against Saakashvili's transfer to a prison hospital, saying the move ""creates additional risks."" ""We call on the Georgian side to transfer Mikheil Saakashvili to a civilian medical facility without delay,"" the foreign ministry said in a note of protest sent to Tbilisi. Saakashvili, who was stripped of his Georgian passport in 2015, is now a national of Ukraine, where he headed — until his arrest — a government agency steering reforms. Saakashvili's lawyers have expressed concerns that his ""security will not be guaranteed in the prison hospital where convicted criminals are employed as paramedics."" The independent Pirveli TV channel reported that inmates in the prison hospital staged a noisy protest against Saakashvili, shouting profanities at the man who led a relentless campaign against organized crime during his tenure as president. Lomjaria, who visited Saakashvili in custody, said he was moved to a prison hospital against his will and was misled that he was to be transferred to a civilian clinic. Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili sparked an uproar recently by saying that Saakashvili ""has the right to commit suicide"" and that the government had been forced to arrest him because he refused to quit politics.",1,583,91.09,72.6,6.12,2.25,23.32,33.96,81.82,54.2,42.54,9.26,7.55,0.69,1.03,0,4.8,0,1.72,12.86,8.23,1.54,14.41,6.69,1.03,3.43,1.03,13.72,3.43,1.54,11.49,1.54,1.37,8.58,4.97,0,4.8,0.51,1.37,0.17,0.17,0.17,2.57,0,5.15,1.2,3.95,0.34,0,0.34,0.17,0.17,0,0,16.3,7.2,0,0,2.4,0.34,4.29,8.92,0,0,0.17,4.97,4.29,3.95,0,0.34,4.97,0.69,0,3.77,0.17,0.51,4.12,2.57,1.2,0,0.17,0,0,0.51,0.51,0.86,0,0,0.34,0,0,0.17,1.03,0.34,2.4,6.86,0.34,1.89,4.46,0.17,0.34,0,4.46,6.35,3.09,1.54,0,0,0,0,0,16.47,4.29,5.66,0,0,1.54,4.97

Bonner said he plans to retire after preserving the Kyiv Post’s archives. Reporters at Kyiv Post accused Kivan of attempting to “infringe” on the paper’s editorial independence with plans to expand the Kyiv Post with a Ukrainian-language edition. “We see this as the owner getting rid of inconvenient, fair and honest journalists,” they said in a joint statement posted on staff writer Anna Myroniuk’s Facebook page. “We consider the cessation of publication and the dismissal of the paper’s staff to be an act of vengeance by Adnan Kivan,” the reporters added. Kivan is a native of Syria who moved to Soviet Ukraine in the early 1980s and is now among the country’s wealthiest people. According to the U.S.-funded RFE/RL news organization, Kivan’s company Kadorr Group did not immediately comment on the Kyiv Post reporters’ allegations.

During a meeting with senior Defense Ministry officials, Putin said the military already had more than 2,000 drones at its disposal. ""More work must be done on this... in particular through the use of artificial intelligence and the latest scientific and technological advances,"" he said in remarks released by the Kremlin. Putin said drones had proven their effectiveness in recent conflicts and that Russia had developed defenses against their use, including against ""terrorist drone attacks"" in Syria. ""We have learned how to repel these attacks and are doing it effectively,"" Putin said. Drone development is part of a major push for weapons development under Putin, who has made increased Russian military might a cornerstone of his two-decade rule. A new generation of the Sukhoi stealth fighter jet — dubbed ""The Checkmate"" — was unveiled earlier this year with the ability to carry and launch drones in flight. Russia has also taken the lead in developing hypersonic missiles, which can fly more than five times the speed of sound and maneuver in mid-flight, making them hard to track and intercept. Turkey and Israel have been selling drones in the former Soviet Union and they played a key role Azerbaijan's victory over Armenia in last year's Nagorno-Karabakh war. Russia last month raised concerns about Ukraine's first drone attack — using a Turkish-made TB2 Bayraktar drone — on pro-Moscow separatists, saying it could ""destabilize"" the frontline in eastern Ukraine.",1,254,92,49.43,38.67,15.8,23.09,30.31,76.38,57.87,43.31,6.69,3.54,0,0.39,0,1.18,1.57,3.15,12.2,6.69,1.57,15.75,7.09,1.97,4.72,0,14.17,5.91,4.33,8.66,0.79,2.76,5.91,10.63,0,9.84,1.57,2.76,1.57,0.39,1.18,3.54,0,4.33,1.97,2.36,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.24,5.51,0,0,1.57,0,3.15,4.72,0,0,0,1.18,4.33,1.57,0.79,1.97,2.36,0.39,0,1.57,0.39,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.39,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.97,9.45,0.39,2.36,5.91,0,0.39,0.39,5.91,7.09,1.97,0.39,0,0,0,0,0,16.54,5.12,3.94,0,0,1.57,5.91

The deportation of Tom Vennink, Dutch daily de Volkskrant's Russia correspondent, follows BBC correspondent Sarah Rainsford's expulsion in August. Russian authorities revoked Vennink’s residence permit on Monday and gave him three days to leave the country over two administrative fines dating back years, according to de Volkskrant. He was fined in 2019 for failing to register with migration authorities on time and in 2020 for visiting the restricted border security zone of Chukotka in far northeastern Siberia. Moscow informed the Dutch government that Vennink’s visa cannot be extended on Wednesday morning, de Volkskrant said. Vennink, who has worked as de Volkskrant’s Moscow correspondent since 2015, is not allowed back in Russia until January 2025. De Volkskrant editor-in-chief Pieter Klok said it was unusual for Russian authorities to deport a foreign correspondent due to old infractions. “It’s a mystery to us why the Russian government has decided this now,” Klok said. “Such administrative offenses were never an obstacle to extending residence permits in previous years,” he added. Dutch Foreign Minister Ben Knapen said “it’s not acceptable for the Netherlands if a journalist has to leave a country against his will.” Knapen added that the ministry’s last-minute attempts to prevent the journalist’s expulsion from Russia yielded no results.

""If they impose additional sanctions on us... we must respond,"" Lukashenko said in comments to officials in Minsk released by the presidency. ""We are warming Europe, and they are threatening us,"" he said, pointing out that Russia's Yamal-Europe gas pipeline transits through Belarus to Poland. ""And what if we halt natural gas supplies?"" Pressure is building to address the plight of hundreds of migrants, mainly Kurds from the Middle East, who are stuck at the Belarus-Poland border in freezing weather. The UN Security Council was to meet later Thursday for emergency talks on the crisis, after international appeals to deal with the refugees' plight. The West accuses Lukashenko of luring the migrants to Belarus to send them across the border, in revenge for sanctions imposed last year after a heavy crackdown on the opposition. EU officials say they expect to approve new sanctions over the migrant crisis next week. Poland has deployed 15,000 troops along the border, put up a fence topped with barbed wire and approved construction of a wall on the frontier with Belarus. In a statement released for Poland's Independence Day on Thursday, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said his country was facing a ""new kind of war"" whose ""ammunition is civilians."" Poland accuses Belarus of using intimidation to force migrants to breach the frontier and refusing to allow them to leave border areas. Belarus has in turn accused Poland of violating international norms by blocking the migrants and violently beating them back. Migrants have been trying to cross the border for months but the crisis came to a head when hundreds made a concerted effort on Monday and were pushed back by Polish border guards. They set up a camp on the border, sheltering in tents and burning wood from local forests to keep warm, blocked by Polish guards behind razor-wire. Belarus says some 2,000 people are living at the camp. Teams from the UN refugee agency, the International Organization for Migration and the Red Cross visited the camp on Thursday to check on conditions and deliver aid, including hygiene kits and diapers. ""Priorities now are to prevent loss of life and move people to safer locations in Belarus,"" UNHCR chief Filippo Grandi said on Twitter. Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis told reporters his country was pushing for an evacuation corridor from the border to the Belarusian city of Grodno, which has an airport that could be used to send people back to their home countries. The migrants have been making sporadic attempts to cross, with Polish border guards reporting 468 attempts overnight Thursday. At least 10 migrants have died on the border, seven of them on the Polish side, according to Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza. Journalists and charity workers have been banned from the immediate border area by Polish authorities under state of emergency rules. Residents in the Polish town of Sokolka near the border said they were worried by the growing tensions but voiced support for the Polish government's tough stance. ""I'm afraid of the migrants getting through and what the consequences would be,"" said Henryk Lenkiewicz, a 67-year-old pensioner walking by a community noticeboard in the town center. European leaders have been putting pressure on Lukashenko's main backer, Russian President Vladimir Putin. German Chancellor Angela Merkel telephoned Putin on Wednesday to ask him ""to use his influence"" to stop what she called an ""inhumane"" instrumentalization of migrants. Poland has accused Putin of masterminding the crisis, a claim the Kremlin has dismissed as ""irresponsible."" France's Europe Minister Clement Beaune said Thursday there was no evidence that Russia was involved in trafficking migrants, adding it should be ""part of the solution because Belarus is more and more dependent on Moscow.""

The Kremlin came under scrutiny earlier this year from France and Germany over a reported deal to send 1,000 fighters from the Kremlin-linked Wagner mercenary group to the conflict-ridden state. ""We realize the need to support Mali's ability to combat terrorism,"" Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said during talks in Moscow with his Malian counterpart, Abdoulaye Diop. ""We provide the country with the necessary equipment, weapons and ammunition. We will do whatever is necessary to prevent threats to Mali's statehood and territorial integrity,"" Lavrov said. He said questions over the role of Russian mercenaries in the country should be directed to Malian authorities and that military initiatives established by private Russian citizens were not Moscow's official business. ""Regarding reports on the Malian government's plans to apply for a Russian PMC's (private military contractor's) services... this question is exclusively within the jurisdiction of the legitimate Malian government,"" Lavrov said.

Yet several unresolved issues had marred the Moldova-Russia gas relationship, notably accumulated debt, which played a major role in the crisis. Moldova’s gas consumption is very small at about 2.9 billion cubic meters (bcm), of which right-bank Moldova consumes about 1.3 bcm, while the breakaway republic of Transnistria consumes the rest. Moldova has no gas production of its own, and its national gas company, Moldovagaz, imports 100 percent of the country’s requirements from Gazprom. Moldovagaz owns the gas transmission network, as well as local supply and distribution companies. Gazprom owns 50 percent of Moldovagaz, with the remaining shares split between the Moldovan central government (36.6 percent) and the administration of the Transnistrian region (13.4 percent). Although Moldova is de facto a partitioned country (the Moldovan central government has no control over Transnistria), Moldovagaz is de jure a unified gas company, and all supply and transit contracts are concluded between Gazprom and Moldovagaz. It is understood that supply contracts stipulate volumes to be delivered to right-bank Moldova and Transnistria separately, with payments also made separately. Debt accumulation has been a constant feature of Russian-Moldovan gas trade throughout the post-Soviet period, with both right-bank Moldova and Transnistria running high debts, although the former’s debt has been significantly lower — and the payment discipline significantly higher — than the latter’s. By October 2021, Moldova’s gas debt stood at about $709 million (principal debt is about $433 million) for right-bank Moldova and about $7 billion for Transnistria. Prior to the end of September 2021, Gazprom supplied gas to Moldova under a 2006 five-year contract that had been extended on an annual basis. That contract, whose price formula was originally based on oil price indexation, was set to expire on September 30, 2021. Under the contract, the average annual price in 2020 was about $148 per thousand cubic meters (mcm). The second half of 2020 saw exceptionally low European gas hub prices, with the Dutch TTF hub price falling to about $75/mcm. The prevailing expectation was that low prices would continue into 2021, thus giving Moldova every incentive to seek some degree of hub price indexation. The Moldovan government apparently sought to negotiate a new contract that would give it more beneficial terms. Although no new contract was signed, the old contract was amended in January 2021 to introduce the German NCG month-ahead hub indexation for the warmer months — the second and third quarters of 2021— while preserving oil price indexation for the first and fourth quarters. Contrary to expectations, European hub prices did not remain at the low level, but started to increase in late 2020, having reached about $300/mcm by January 2021, before falling briefly to about $200/mcm by March 2021, and then increasing sharply and seemingly inexorably to about $900/mcm in September 2021, with a particularly steep rise occurring from August onwards. As some of that increase fed through the contract, the price for Moldova in September 2021 increased to $550/mcm. Suddenly oil price indexation started to look far more beneficial than hub indexation. Meanwhile, witnessing the European gas hubs’ price rally, Moldova never publicly said it wanted to extend the old contract, which would have ensured supplies at lower than hub prices, as its provisions stipulated oil-indexed prices for the fourth and first quarters. Rather, it continued to seek a new gas contract with Gazprom, although reportedly made no serious effort to negotiate it prior to the old contract nearing expiry. The new contract was one of the key issues discussed during the meeting in Chisinau on August 11 between Moldovan President Maia Sandu and Russia’s presidential envoy Dmitry Kozak. Kozak talked positively about the prospects for the new contract, saying that a “mutually beneficial” solution was needed. With the old contract about to expire, no new contract was yet in sight. Gazprom reportedly offered a hub-indexed price (about $790/mcm) with a 25 percent discount, which was conditional on debt repayment over a period of time, whereas Moldova had asked for a 50 percent discount. The price, although high, was reflective of the European gas market. As the parties failed to agree, Moldova asked Gazprom to extend the old contract for October. This request was made on the expiry date of the old contract: September 30. The contract was extended on the same conditions as in September (hub-indexed), resulting in a price of $790/mcm for October. It was not until the old contract expired—and it became clear that talks on a new contract had failed —that Moldova publicly said it wanted to extend the old contract on its previous terms. As Moldova only asked to extend the contract on September 30, Gazprom was unable to book corresponding capacity at an auction held on September 20 in accordance with the EU Capacity Allocation Mechanism (CAM) Network Code, as a result of which Moldova contracted only 54 million cubic meters (mmcm) for its right-bank consumption — the amount for which Gazprom had sufficient capacity under previous bookings — compared with the region’s 80 mmcm monthly consumption for October. As the ensuing shortage led to linepack gas in the Moldovan gas transmission system starting to be used, Moldova introduced a state of emergency on October 22 through November 20 to procure alternative supplies for balancing the grid. For several days, Moldova bought or borrowed additional gas — about 5 mmcm — from other suppliers (such as PGNiG, ERU, Vitol, and DXT) to complement its gas balance and prevent pressure from decreasing to critical levels. That gas was extremely expensive (supplies from PGNiG were about $1100/mcm at the TTF day-ahead rate), but no gas was available at lower prices. Since hubs are the prevalent price formation mechanism in Europe, no European supplier would sell gas to Moldova at a lower price. These purchases made it abundantly clear to Moldova that the only affordable way out of the imminent gas crisis was to secure a contract with Gazprom at a price lower than the hub-based price. It is unclear why the talks on the new contract collapsed. Russian President Vladimir Putin was one of the first world leaders to congratulate Sandu on her convincing victory in Moldova’s presidential elections in December 2020, and his envoy Kozak was the first high-ranking official to visit Moldova after its pro-European government took office in August 2021. As noted above, the Sandu-Kozak meeting sounded very positive. Russia stood to win nothing from a gas standoff with Moldova, either commercially or in PR terms, as it was certain to result in yet more accusations of using gas as a weapon. It seems much more likely that Moldova wanted (and may have been encouraged) to conclude only a short-term contract with Gazprom and not to accept its conditions—including on debt repayment and how to implement the EU acquis with regard to (Gazprom co-owned) Moldovagaz—while hoping there would be a safety net provided should the negotiations fail. No such safety net materialized. As the crisis was unfolding, the EU provided Moldova with financial assistance worth 60 million euros (the equivalent of about two-thirds of Moldova’s monthly consumption at current hub prices) “to set up a support scheme for the most vulnerable people,” but otherwise remained largely on the sidelines. Moldovan Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita asked the EU for help, saying that without a contract with Gazprom, Moldova would need to spend about 800 million euros over the next five months on alternative imports at market prices to meet its winter demand. The EU High Representative for Foreign Policy Josep Borrell said on October 28 that the solution to the crisis would “not come from the European Union funding all the differences between the current prices and the prices that Gazprom is asking for.” The EU’s message could hardly have been clearer, and Moldova signed its contract with Gazprom on the following day, October 29. On October 29, Gazprom and Moldovagaz signed a five-year contract, and supply began on November 1. The contract is understood to be an extension of the old one, with some adjustments. Although the formula has not been published, it reportedly takes into account the price of oil and gas in the preceding nine months, with 70 percent being indexed to oil prices and 30 percent to hub gas prices, with adjustments to be made quarterly. The price for November is about $450/mcm (over 60 percent less than the current hub prices at which Moldova bought balancing gas in the preceding days, and over 40 percent less than the contract hub-indexed price at which it bought gas from Gazprom in October). As before, Russian gas will be delivered at the Moldova-Ukraine border, thus enabling supplies both to right-bank Moldova and Transnistria (through which it will transit). In addition to the contract, a separate protocol was signed aimed at resolving prior disagreements. It addresses inter alia two specific problems that have complicated the Moldova-Russia gas relationship: the accumulation of debt, and the implementation of unbundling provisions of the EU acquis in respect of Moldovagaz. As stated in the protocol, Moldovagaz and Gazprom agreed to conduct an independent audit of Moldovagaz’s debt (with regard to supplies to right-bank Moldova) in 2022 to confirm the amount owed, with further negotiations to be held on the method and the repayment schedule. The protocol stipulates that the amount of debt is to be confirmed by May 2022 and paid back over a five-year period. The protocol also addresses the issue of Moldovagaz’s restructuring. As a contracting party of the Energy Community Treaty (EnCT), Moldova has committed to implement the EU energy acquis, including its unbundling provisions, under which Moldovagaz’s transmission activities would have to be separated from its supply activities. Gazprom, which owns 50 percent of shares in Moldovagaz, stands to be affected by unbundling, not least by the lack of certainty as to what entity will pay the debt once restructuring is complete. The protocol ensures forced restructuring will not be possible until full settlement of the debt, in the amount confirmed by the audit. Notably, the acquis allows for several unbundling models: ownership unbundling, which would necessitate the transmission network being sold off, is not mandatory, and other models allowing for the preservation of network ownership are also possible. It is easy to imagine that Gazprom’s concern over who will pay the debt once Moldovagaz’s unbundling is complete was construed as trying to force Moldova not to implement the EU acquis or undermining its government, thus giving rise to easy (and somewhat lazy) — but unconvincing — narratives of Russia having provoked the crisis to undermine Moldova’s new pro-European government. While there have been allegations of Russia imposing political conditions on Moldova — such as Chisinau’s withdrawal from the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area — in exchange for signing the contract, and the EU’s Borrell referred—without offering evidence—to “attempts by Gazprom to put political pressure in return to lower the gas prices,” both Sandu and Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Spinu have stated that no political conditions were attached as part of Moldova’s agreeing to the contract. The Russian-Moldovan gas relationship has always been heavily skewed in Russia’s favor because of Moldova’s high dependence on Russian gas imports, for which it was not able to pay in full and on time, and its relatively minor transit role compared to Ukraine and Belarus. The nature of this asymmetry has changed over time due to the construction of the TurkStream gas pipeline from Russia to Turkey, which has reduced Moldova’s transit role further, and the new Romania-Moldova interconnector (owned by the Romanian national gas company Transgaz), which enables Moldova to import gas from suppliers other than Gazprom, at least in the amount needed for its right-bank consumption. Having the technical ability to import gas from other suppliers strengthened Moldova’s position vis-à-vis Gazprom in that the latter is unable to demand a price for its gas higher than the price set by the European hubs. Of course, there is nothing to stop Gazprom from offering Moldova a discount on that price if it wishes to do so. At a time when European hub prices are at historic highs, the conclusion of the new five-year contract with Gazprom—which has elements of both gas hub and oil price indexation, and a nine-month lag, making it possible to even out the impact of high prices and volatility over time—is a positive development for Moldova, securing its gas supply balance ahead of winter and alleviating serious pressure on its very weak finances. While Gazprom has been able to rein in right-bank Moldova’s debt, its ability to extract payment from Transnistria, which has accumulated about $7 billion of debt, remains seriously constrained by the region’s undefined status. A lasting political solution of Transnistria’s “frozen” conflict would be conducive to the improved economic performance of Moldova (including Transnistria), and would enhance its ability to pay for its gas imports in the future — both from Gazprom and other suppliers. A broader point in European-Russian gas relations is that despite a significant—and successful — effort made by the EU in the 2010s to diversify supplies and reduce the dependence of its most vulnerable member states on Russian gas, Russia will continue to remain an important supplier of gas both to the EU and non-EU countries in the shared EU-Russia neighborhood — Moldova, Belarus, and non-EU Balkan countries —due to the competitiveness of its gas. The Moldovan crisis has demonstrated that no European supplier will sell gas at a price below hub level and that any country — especially where the EU acquis is being implemented — can be sure that Gazprom’s price will not be higher than the price set by the European hubs (which makes Gazprom a supplier like any other) and may be lower (which could make Gazprom a preferred supplier in countries with weaker economies). The ongoing European gas supply crunch this winter has demonstrated the limitations of EU diversification efforts. It is important to recognize this and encourage countries in the shared EU-Russia neighborhood to create gas markets on which both Gazprom and non-Gazprom exporters can compete.",1,2377,96.36,20.21,32.98,37.14,32.12,31.26,78.67,58.86,45.52,4.21,0.17,0,0,0,0.08,0,4.04,14.39,8.71,3.79,17.59,5.72,2.94,5.26,1.01,9.51,6.65,6.69,3.83,0.55,1.22,2.19,9.59,0.8,8.79,1.09,1.47,1.26,1.22,0.29,3.58,0,2.31,1.72,0.55,0.13,0.08,0,0,0,0,0,3.79,2.82,0.38,0.17,0.21,0.08,0.97,0.72,0,0,0.04,0.04,2.1,1.18,0.8,0.13,7.78,0.13,0.08,3.37,4.25,0.08,0.21,0.13,0,0,0,0,0,0.04,0,0.67,0.21,0.67,0.08,0.25,0,0.42,0.5,0.04,2.02,7.03,0.29,0.46,6.18,0.21,0.04,0.08,5.72,4.71,2.23,0.97,0.04,0,0.04,0,0,14.51,3.28,4.63,0,0,1.26,5.34

Ever since Russia conquered the Taman peninsula — a hilly, lagoon-studded spur of land that faces annexed Crimea across the Kerch Strait — in 1828, scholars have puzzled over how Phanagoria, the dynamic Ancient Greek colony it housed, could have thrived for almost two millennia before vanishing almost without trace. “You can find grand stone cities anywhere on the Mediterranean,” said Vladimir Kuznetsov, a 68-year-old archaeologist who has been working on the site since 1978. “But what we have at Phanagoria is different.” Situated outside the small village of Sennoy, Phanagoria, now one of Russia’s best-resourced and highest-profile digs, shines a light not just on the region’s long-lost Ancient Greek heritage, but also on how Russian archaeologists have had to adapt to a difficult financial environment with limited state support. Though archaeologists have been working at Phanagoria on and off since 1936, few of the site’s recent finds would ever have been made, were it not for a chance — and very Russian — twist of fate. In 2004, billionaire industrialist Oleg Deripaska — owner of the RusAl aluminium company and a native of the local Krasnodar region who owns a home a few hours’ drive from Phanagoria — began financing the excavations. His Volnoe Delo charitable foundation has so far donated $16.4 million to the project. Strung out along a remote, uninhabited stretch of a slender cove that burrows its way into the peninsula, rising seas and shifting dunes have buried ancient Phanagoria under an unusually thick layer of sand and swamps. For professional archaeologists — whose work is often obstructed by modern structures — it’s a scientific dream come true. “The archaeological layer here runs six metres deep, with each era in the city’s history preserved on top of the last. It’s very rare to have a layer so deep,” said Kuznetsov. Nestled as it is today between the budget resort villages of the Black Sea riviera and the hypersensitive military bottleneck of the Kerch Strait, it is hard to imagine that the Taman peninsula was once a thriving commercial hub. However, Phanagoria, a Greek colony founded around 543 BC by refugees from the Persian conquest of Anatolia, grew into a prosperous city-state on the back of trade with the Scythian tribes of what is now Ukraine. Though only around two percent of the Phanagoria site has been excavated, finds already testify to a wealthy and powerful settlement, passed down through the succession of empires that have dominated Russia’s southern steppe. There’s the fragment of marble wall engraved with Persian cuneiform text, the only one of its kind ever found outside the former Persian Empire. The menorah-engraved tombstones, evidence that the faith of the Khazars — a tribe of Turkic nomads who converted to Judaism in the first millennium — was present in this part of Russia. Or its Christian diocese, Russia’s oldest, which predates the conversion of Kievan Rus to Christianity by almost 500 years. Phanagoria’s sudden extinction, around the year 1000, remains an archaeological mystery. Historians say a letter discovered in a Cairo archive in the late nineteenth century may hint that early Russian invaders from the north were responsible. Though archaeology has never been chief among rich Russians’ charitable causes, a string of bespoke archaeological funds help wealthy Russians support digs. Deripaska’s support of Phanagoria, however, makes him the single biggest donor to archaeological causes in Russia, and Phanagoria by far the country’s best-financed dig. “For rich Russians, supporting archaeology is a lot like supporting artistic causes,” said Elisabeth Schimpfossl, a senior lecturer at the U.K.’s Aston University and author of a book on rich Russians and their philanthropic habits. “It’s often about filling in gaps where state provision is lacking.” Though individual philanthropy plays a major role in archaeology all around the world, in Russia — where government grants for the field are rare to non-existent — private largesse has assumed particular importance. “In Russia, there is no direct state aid for archaeology,” said Anastasia Stoyanova, an archaeologist and head of Millenium Legacy, a charitable fund supporting digs in Crimea. “There are a few indirect grants but it’s almost impossible to actually get one, and they don’t provide the long-term, year-on-year support you need for a serious project, anyway.” In the absence of meaningful state subsidies, many Russian archaeological projects are financed by so-called “rescue archaeology,” or commercial contracts to excavate construction sites. With developers legally required to pay to excavate lands they plan to build on, Russian archaeologists are often forced to recycle their private earnings from commercial work to support their academic projects themselves. With the broader field’s funding tenuous, Phanagoria has emerged as a lavishly resourced outlier, even as much of the rest of Russia’s archaeological heritage remains underexplored and at risk. “In general, the outlook for archaeology in Russia isn’t great,” said Stoyanova. “There are a handful of sites like Phanagoria, which are very well provided for. But apart from that, the situation is tough.” For Kuznetsov, who recalls working on the Phanagoria site with only his wife during the economic crisis of the 1990s when funding for archaeology withered away, financing from Deripaska — who has been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department — has been transformational. “Not having to worry about your funding does give you a certain freedom,” he said. On the walls of Phanagoria’s luxurious, Deripaska-built visitors’ complex hang photographs of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Defense Minister Sergei Shoygu, both of whom have visited the excavations. Out on the site, the results of the site’s lavish funding are even clearer. Its financing guaranteed, Phanagoria has been able to attract an expansive team of scholars, including numismatists to study the city’s coinage, and anthropologists to reconstruct its everyday life. Analysis of human remains found at the site has enabled the project to make groundbreaking discoveries, including determining an ancient Phanagorian’s life expectancy — 38 years — and to identify the parasites that likely inhabited their bodies. “Without exaggeration, I honestly don’t think there’s a team like ours anywhere else in Russia,” said Kuznetsov. Now, a vast new museum complex is planned to cater for Russian tourists travelling to annexed Crimea on the newly built bridge, which spans the Kerch Strait within view of Phanagoria. For Kuznetsov and his team, however, the focus remains on excavating the as-yet-untouched remainder of the 65-hectare site. One story, of the deposed Byzantine emperor Justinian II who was reputedly exiled to Phanagoria at the turn of the eighth century, has spurred many to wonder what else might be hidden beneath the peninsula’s rolling hills. “If a Byzantine emperor lived here, you’d assume he had a palace,” said Kuznetsov, gesturing toward the gentle, grassy slopes around the digsite. “I just don’t know where it is yet.”",1,1144,93.48,44.72,56.75,37.87,25.42,30.94,78.67,59.44,47.29,5.51,2.71,0.17,0.17,0.52,0.52,0.61,2.8,14.25,9.79,2.45,16.17,6.47,5.86,3.93,0.79,10.66,7.69,4.11,3.58,0.87,0.87,1.92,9.97,0.79,9.18,2.27,1.49,0.52,2.01,0.26,2.97,0.09,2.1,1.66,0.44,0.09,0,0.09,0.09,0,0,0,7.34,3.23,1.57,0,0.17,0,1.05,4.02,0.09,0,0.09,0.52,2.53,0.87,1.66,0,6.56,0.17,0.09,3.23,2.8,0.44,0.61,0.09,0.09,0,0,0,0,0,0.09,0.61,0,0.09,0.17,0,0,0.17,0.26,0.26,3.67,11.1,0.09,0.79,9.62,0.52,0,0.09,4.28,4.2,4.55,0.52,0.26,0.26,0.09,0,0,18.09,4.37,6.73,0,0,2.88,4.11

Escalating  Russia - Ukraine Tensions by Arming Kiev – Kremlin,English,Russia,"The United States is “escalating” the tense situation between Kiev and Moscow by sending weapons and military advisers to Ukraine, the Kremlin said Tuesday. The comments come after CNN reported, citing unnamed sources familiar with the deliberations, that the Biden administration is considering sending Javelin anti-tank missiles, stinger air defense missiles and military advisers to Ukraine amid Western concerns of getting caught by surprise with a possible Russian invasion in January. The Pentagon has also reportedly been pressing Washington to redirect equipment including Russian-made Mi-17 helicopters from its original destination of Afghanistan to Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said military advisers and weapons systems are arriving in Ukraine “not only from the U.S. but other NATO countries.” “This all leads to further escalation,” the state-run TASS news agency quoted Peskov as saying. Peskov also accused the Ukrainian armed forces of making “provocations” with the possible goal of reclaiming southeastern territories lost during its war with pro-Moscow rebels. “We are deeply concerned about the provocative actions of the Ukrainian armed forces on the line of contact and preparations for a possible military solution of the Donbass problem,” he added, referring to the separatist-held Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine. Peskov previously dismissed the claims of Russian troops massing near the Ukraine border as “hysteria” and as non-threatening domestic military moves. “Who’ll be attacking whom? Russia — Ukraine or Ukraine — Russia?” Peskov asked. “We assert that Ukraine is planning aggressive actions against Donbass.” Putin previously blamed the West for “escalating” the Ukraine conflict with Black Sea drills and U.S. bomber flights near Russian borders. Russia’s SVR spy agency on Monday dismissed claims of plans to invade Ukraine in a rare statement.

The comments come as Russia musters military units on its border with Ukraine. Moscow has dismissed growing Western claims that Russia may be preparing to invade Ukraine, instead accusing NATO of provocations. ""There is a threat today that there will be war tomorrow,"" Zelenskiy told a a marathon press conference with Ukrainian and international media. ""We are entirely prepared for an escalation."" Zelensky also called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to deny he was planning to invade Ukraine. ""The president of Russia should say in public: 'We are not planning this',"" he said. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg repeated Western concerns about the build-up on Friday and warned that ""if Russia uses force against Ukraine, that will have costs, that will have consequences."" Kiev has been at war with pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine for nearly eight years in a conflict that has taken over 13,000 lives. Ukraine and its Western allies accuse Russia of funding and arming the rebels, claims Moscow denies. Zelenskiy did not give details of the coup plot or accuse the Russian state of involvement, although he did say it involved Russian citizens. “I received information that a coup d'etat will take place in our country on Dec. 1-2,” he said. Zelenskiy said the Ukrainian security services obtained audio recordings in which the alleged plotters — named only as “representatives” of Ukraine and Russia — discuss their plans, mentioning billionaire Rinat Akhmetov’s possible involvement. He clarified that he believes Akhmetov, an energy tycoon whose media holdings have ramped up criticism of Zelenskiy in recent weeks, is not involved in the coup plot himself. “Let’s just say [the plotters] are discussing with Russia Rinat Akhmetov’s participation in the coup d’état in Ukraine, which will attract $1 billion,” he said. The Kremlin denied any involvement. “We don’t engage in that,” Interfax quoted Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov as telling reporters. Zelenskiy’s “de-oligarchization” campaign to reduce the influence of Ukraine’s wealthiest people on the country’s politics has been met with criticism from the Ukrainian elite.

Hysteria  Over Ukraine Conflict,English,Russia,"Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Sunday slammed the United States for driving ""hysteria"" over a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine, after Western countries accused Moscow of a troop build-up near the ex-Soviet country. His comments come as Western countries this week raised alarm over Russian military activity near Ukraine and Washington said it has ""real concerns"" over what it called ""unusual"" activity. ""This hysteria is being whipped up artificially,"" Peskov said on state television. ""Those who have brought their armed forces from overseas are accusing us of unusual military activity on our own territory. That is, the United States."" Ukraine's army has been locked in a simmering conflict with pro-Russian separatists in two breakaway regions bordering Russia since 2014, after Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine. Kiev and its Western allies accuse Russia of sending troops and arms across the border to support the separatists — claims Moscow denies. Peskov's comments come after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Saturday declined to say whether U.S. intelligence believed Russian President Vladimir Putin was aiming to seize land from Ukraine. ""We don't know what President Putin's intentions are. But we do know what's happened in the past,"" Blinken said. ""We know the playbook of trying to cite some illusory provocation from Ukraine or any other country and using that as an excuse for what Russia plans to do all along."" Putin for his part said Thursday that the West is ""escalating"" the Ukraine conflict by holding drills in the Black Sea and flying bombers near its borders. After an uptick in violence at the beginning of the year, Russia massed around 100,000 troops on Ukraine's borders in the spring, raising fears of a major escalation in the conflict which has claimed over 13,000 lives. Russia later announced a pullback but both Ukraine and its ally the United States said at the time the withdrawal was limited. Deputy Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, meanwhile, said Sunday that preparations were underway for another summit between Putin and U.S. President Joe Biden, after they met in Geneva earlier this year. Despite increased contacts between the two rivals since the June summit, tensions have recently spiked. In addition to the Ukraine conflict, the United States has warned Russia over its alleged influence in the migrant crisis on the Belarus-Poland border as well a missile strike on a satellite last week.

The comments come after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russia has gathered nearly 100,000 troops near its border and that Western countries had shared information about active Russian troop movements with Kiev. “We’re not recording any neighboring country’s equipment or military movement directly near the border,” Ukrainian state border service spokesman Andriy Demchenko said. “If any actions are taking place, they may be tens or even hundreds of kilometers from the state border,” the Russian state-run TASS news agency quoted Demchenko as saying on Ukraine's 24 Kanal channel. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said the U.S.-led alliance spotted “large and unusual concentrations of Russian forces” at Ukraine’s border in recent weeks. Western officials also accuse Moscow of using the escalating migrant crisis on the Polish-Belarus border to “distract” from its activities near Ukraine. The Kremlin has dismissed the concerns as unfounded, instead complaining about increased NATO activity in the region. Ukraine remains locked in a festering conflict with pro-Russia separatists in the east of the country that started seven years ago. French President Emmanuel Macron expressed “willingness to defend the territorial integrity of Ukraine” to Russian President Vladimir Putin in a telephone conversation Monday. Putin responded by saying that negotiations were ""made difficult"" by the Ukrainian authorities, the Elysee said. It added that this line of reasoning was ""often"" used by the Russian leader. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week it would be a ""serious mistake for Russia to engage in a repeat of what it did in 2014,” when it seized Crimea from Kiev.

Just last month, he spent several hours discussing world affairs at the annual Valdai Club meeting; more recently, he gave a wide-ranging interview to Russian TV, in which he discussed Ukraine, Belarus, NATO, and the United States. His appearance on Nov. 18 at a gathering of Russian Foreign Ministry senior officials resulted in a public speech and more private discussions, which of course remain confidential. The speech was fairly short, but made several important new points. The most interesting and intriguing passage concerned Russia’s adversaries: the United States, its NATO allies, and clients such as Ukraine. “Our recent warnings have had a certain effect: tensions have arisen there anyway,” Putin told the assembled officials. “It is important for them to remain in this state for as long as possible, so that it does not occur to them to stage some kind of conflict… we do not need a new conflict,” the Russian president added. Putin did not mean diplomatic warnings. Diplomacy is de facto paralyzed in Russia’s relations with Ukraine, NATO, the European Union’s leading powers such as Germany and France, and with the United States as far as Ukraine is concerned. The Kremlin has at this point completely written off Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as a negotiating partner. In exasperation with the Europeans de facto siding with Kiev against Moscow on the implementation of the Minsk Agreements, the Foreign Ministry published diplomatic correspondence between its head Sergey Lavrov and his counterparts in Paris and Berlin; according to Sergei Ryabkov, Lavrov’s deputy, recent exchanges on Ukraine with visiting U.S. Under Secretary of State Victoria Nuland produced zero results and zero understanding in Washington of Moscow’s arguments. The Kremlin also responded to NATO’s expulsion of Russian officers attached to Moscow’s mission to Brussels by severing all ties with the alliance. Instead, the warnings the Russian president was likely referring to are the activities of the Russian military. At the beginning of the year, the Russian Defense Ministry held a major exercise that included a concentration of significant forces along the entire length of the border with Ukraine: to its north, east, and south. Russian troop movements were made clearly visible, and carried the chilling message that it might not be a drill. Dmitry Kozak, the Kremlin point man on Donbass and relations with Kiev, repeated Putin’s earlier warning that a Ukrainian attempt to retake the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk regions — à la then Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili’s doomed adventure in South Ossetia in 2008 — would mean the end of the present Ukrainian state. Indeed, the exercises were taken seriously by the Americans. General Mark Milley, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, engaged in direct consultations with General Valery Gerasimov, chief of the Russian General Staff. Finally, U.S. President Joe Biden invited Vladimir Putin to a meeting in Geneva which resulted in a resumption of U.S.-Russian strategic stability talks. Yet there was no de-escalation with regard to Ukraine, the Black Sea region, and, more broadly, Eastern Europe. During the summer, a British Navy destroyer challenged Russia by sailing through territorial waters off Crimea, and Ukraine passed legislation that denied ethnic Russians the status of an indigenous community and prepared to adopt another law that, in Moscow’s view, would be tantamount to Kiev formally leaving the Minsk accords. In Donbass, the Ukrainians used a Turkish-made drone to strike pro-Russian forces; NATO significantly increased its presence and activity in the Black Sea; and U.S. strategic bombers flew missions as close as 20 kilometers from the Russian border, according to Putin. The gas price crunch in Europe provoked bitter accusations that Russia had caused it. Even the migrant crisis on Poland’s border, part of a plan by Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko to punish the EU and coerce its leaders into a dialogue with him, was blamed directly on the Kremlin. What some in Moscow had prematurely called the “spirit of Geneva” all but evaporated. Not that Russia was doing nothing to respond to and even get ahead of its adversaries. Russia allowed half a million of its newly acquired citizens in Donbass to vote in the September elections to the State Duma; made the produce of Donbass enterprises eligible for Russian government purchases; and stopped coal deliveries to Ukraine. Both President Putin and former president Dmitry Medvedev, now serving as deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, published long articles that were scathingly critical of the policies of the Ukrainian authorities and essentially concluded that there was no use talking to Kiev anymore. Against that background, reports appeared in the United States suggesting that Russia was again massing its forces on the border, and possibly preparing to invade Ukraine sooner rather than later. Right now, fears of a war in Ukraine are widespread. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has warned the Kremlin not to try to repeat what it did in 2014, lest it regret it. In fact, the stakes are much higher today than they were seven-plus years ago. In 2014, Putin, having received a mandate from the Russian parliament to use military force “in Ukraine,” limited its factual use to Crimea, plus, in a covert form, Donbass. Next time, as Putin’s own words suggest, the geographic scope of Russian military action, should the Russian commander-in-chief order it, is likely to be much broader. Those speculating what form it might take need not look at the ancient precedents of Afghanistan, Czechoslovakia, or Hungary. It makes more sense to look at Syria, except that a war in Ukraine may not be contained. Will President Putin make the fateful decision? Is Ukraine that “unfinished business” that he will seek to complete before the end of his reign? Or is Putin just bluffing? A few things are clear. NATO membership or not, seeing Ukraine turn into a U.S.-controlled unsinkable aircraft carrier parked on Russia’s border just a few hundred miles from Moscow — an apt comparison by my Carnegie colleagues in Washington — is no more acceptable to the Kremlin than that other unsinkable aircraft carrier, Cuba, was to the White House almost sixty years ago. Any Russian leader would seek to prevent such anchorage, using whatever means they have at their disposal. Another contingency would be massive military action by Ukrainian forces in Donbass, however unlikely that may seem in the West. What Saakashvili did in trying to retake South Ossetia by force back in 2008 never looked too clever to begin with, and yet he was not stopped by Georgia’s senior ally. In his speech to diplomats on Thursday, Putin called Western countries unreliable. In particular, he accused them of only “superficially” acknowledging Russia’s red lines and warnings — whatever he may have meant by that “superficiality.” Putin has called on Lavrov to provide Russia with “serious long-term guarantees” in the Euro-Atlantic region. That sounds puzzling. There is little that Russian diplomats can do to procure for Putin what he wants. More likely, the head of state may be exhorting his diplomats to exploit the fruits of military deterrence that Putin is busy organizing around Ukraine, in the Black Sea region, and elsewhere in Europe’s east. The Russian president is not, of course, leaving that task entirely to his subordinates. Even as he was delivering his hardline speech, his Security Council secretary was in talks with the U.S. National Security Adviser about another possible meeting between Putin and Biden. As always with deterrence, it can only work if the threat is believed to be credible, while any attempt to test whether the other side is bluffing may end in disaster.

""Any movement of Russian troops inside our territory does not pose a threat to anyone and should not cause concern to anyone,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. He previously dismissed the Western claims as ""hysteria."" In its statement, the SVR also said it had information on ""creeping advances"" by the Ukrainian armed forces, as well as Ukraine organising a ""concentration of forces"" in areas bordering Russia and Belarus. Kiev has said it would deploy thousands of border guards and security personnel to its frontier with Belarus because of a migrant crisis that has seen tensions soar between the EU and Minsk. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter that Russian accusations of Kiev ""plotting a military attack"" in its separatist east are ""false."" He said Ukraine is ""working hard to revive"" peace talks with France and Germany as mediators and called on Moscow to ""engage constructively in these peace efforts instead of undermining them."" France and Germany had accused Moscow last week of breaking diplomatic rules by publishing confidential correspondence over the planning of peace talks. Russian President Vladimir Putin last week said the West was ""escalating"" the Ukraine conflict by holding drills in the Black Sea. He also said the US flew bombers near Russia's borders.

Intel Believes Russian Invasion of Ukraine  Imminent  – Bloomberg,English,Russia,"The United States has warned European allies that Russia is readying for a possible invasion of Ukraine “on a scale far greater than seven years ago,” Bloomberg reported Monday. Russia has been accused by the West of funding and arming pro-Moscow rebels in eastern Ukraine since the outbreak of conflict there in 2014, claims Moscow denies. U.S. intelligence shared with some NATO members reportedly expresses “high confidence” that Russia could invade Ukraine from annexed Crimea, the western Russian border and Belarus as soon as next year, Bloomberg reported. “America and others are not saying a war is certain, or even that they know for sure Putin is serious about one,” Bloomberg said. It added that its sources “said it is likely [Putin] has not yet decided what to do.” Bloomberg reported that around half of the 100,000 soldiers are already in position for a rapid, large-scale push through “rough terrain and freezing conditions” over extensive territory and potentially prolonged occupation. Citing two unnamed people familiar with the intelligence-sharing, Bloomberg reported that Russia has also carried out an unannounced call-up of reservists “to secure territory in a later phase.” The Kremlin said Monday that the multiple reports of Russia’s planned invasion of Ukraine are “camouflage” for Ukraine’s “belligerent” attempts to reclaim ceded pro-Moscow eastern territories with outside help.

""Russia has an interest in everybody in Europe finally coming to their senses and stopping considering Russia the culprit of all problems,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. He added that Europe should instead ""address the primary sources of the problems that are currently suffocating Europe."" His remarks come after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday warned Russia against any ""military adventurism"" on the borders of Ukraine and EU member Poland. ""Recently there have been a lot of hysterical publications in Britain,"" Peskov said. ""Russia is not waging any hybrid wars,"" he added. Later on Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to address a Foreign Ministry meeting with ""detailed"" remarks, Peskov said. NATO and Western governments have denounced a build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, which has been fighting a war with pro-Russia separatists in its east since 2014. Russia had carried out large-scale drills near the Ukraine border and in annexed Crimea in the spring, sparking concerns of a possible invasion. Kiev, which in recent weeks downplayed the scale of Russia's presence at its borders, said Thursday it was seeking more military aid from the West. Videos circulated recently on social media have shown Russia moving troops, tanks and missiles towards the Ukrainian border. ""Russia's aggressiveness, both diplomatic and military, has increased considerably in recent weeks,"" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told a press briefing. The minister said that after his visits to Washington and Brussels ""work is underway to develop a comprehensive package for the containment of Russia."" He added that Kiev is in negotiations with the West for ""the supply of additional defense weapons for our army."" Moscow, in turn, has accused Kiev and the West of warmongering. In a call with French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday, Putin said U.S.-led exercises in the Black Sea were ""provocative"" and were ""increasing tensions"" between Moscow and NATO. According to the Elysee, Macron told Putin that France was ready to defend Ukraine's territorial integrity. Some Western governments have also accused Moscow of helping orchestrate the migrant crisis on the Belarus-Poland border. Several thousand migrants — mostly from the Middle East — have been staying in makeshift camps on the border in hopes of entering the EU. Brussels has accused Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko of luring the migrants to the border as revenge for sanctions against his regime over last year's crackdown on protests. Lukashenko and the Kremlin have rejected the accusations and criticized the EU for not taking in the migrants. The Belarusian strongman has twice spoken by telephone this week with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in his first direct contacts with a Western leader since last year's disputed presidential election.

Addressing an investor conference via video link, Putin declined to say whether Moscow planned to move troops across Ukraine's border — as the West has been alleging for weeks. ""Look, they spoke about a possible Russian military intervention in Ukraine at the beginning of the year. But as you see this did not happen,"" Putin said. ""It is not about intervening or not intervening, fighting or not fighting. It's about mending ties,"" Putin said, adding that it was important to take into account the security interests of all parties. ""If we sincerely strive to achieve this then no one will feel threatened."" Putin addressed investors as tensions spiral between Moscow and Brussels, and NATO looks to counter a fresh Russian military buildup on Ukraine's border. The new buildup follows a similar surge in the spring, when Russia gathered around 100,000 troops on Ukraine's borders but later announced a drawdown. Putin said Moscow was concerned by Western moves to conduct large-scale previously unannounced military drills near Russia's borders, singling out U.S.-led exercises in the Black Sea.

Putin has been voicing concern about U.S. naval exercises in the Black Sea for days, telling his French counterpart this week that they were ""provocative"" and leading to ""increasing tensions"" between Moscow and NATO. He has also slammed Ukraine for using a Turkish-made drone against pro-Moscow rebels. The Black Sea is a sensitive region for Russia, which controls the Crimea peninsula after annexing it from Ukraine in 2014. Since then, Kiev has fought a conflict with pro-Russia rebels in the east of the country which has claimed more than 13,000 lives. Renewed Western speculation about Russia's plans in eastern Ukraine have come amid a clash over an unexpected migrant crisis on the border with Kremlin-aligned Belarus and EU member Poland. The EU has accused the Kremlin-backed regime of Alexander Lukashenko in Belarus of purposefully luring thousands of migrants — mostly from the Middle-East — to its doorstep as revenge for sanctions. Some in the EU, including Poland, have said that Moscow is also behind the crisis. ""Brussels needs to understand that the decreasing of military-political tensions is not only in Russian interests, but in those of the whole of Europe, and even the world,"" Putin said. Earlier on Thursday, the Kremlin said Europe should not blame Russia for ""all problems."" ""Russia has an interest in everybody in Europe finally coming to their senses and stopping considering Russia the culprit of all problems,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. He added that Europe should instead ""address the primary sources of the problems that are currently suffocating Europe."" Peskov's remarks come after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday warned Russia against any ""military adventurism"" on the borders of Ukraine and EU member Poland. ""Recently there have been a lot of hysterical publications in Britain,"" Peskov said. ""Russia is not waging any hybrid wars,"" he added. Russia had carried out large-scale drills near the Ukraine border and in annexed Crimea in the spring, sparking concerns of a possible invasion. Kiev, which in recent weeks downplayed the scale of Russia's presence at its borders, on Thursday said it was seeking more military aid from the West. Videos circulated recently on social media have shown Russia moving troops, tanks and missiles towards the Ukrainian border. ""Russia's aggressiveness, both diplomatic and military, has increased considerably in recent weeks,"" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told a press briefing. The minister said that after his visits to Washington and Brussels ""work is under way to develop a comprehensive package for the containment of Russia."" He added that Kiev is in negotiations with the West for ""the supply of additional defense weapons for our army."" Moscow, in turn, has accused Kiev and the West of warmongering. This week, France's Macron told Putin that Paris was ready to defend Ukraine's territorial integrity, according to the Elysee.",1,600,95.86,51.99,55.14,1,21.43,31.5,76,57.67,44.33,6.17,2.33,0,0.67,0,1.33,0.33,3.83,14.5,8.5,0.67,17,5.67,2.5,4.33,0.5,11.33,5.83,5,5.67,1.5,0.5,3.83,7.5,0.67,6.67,1.17,1,0.67,0.67,0,2.33,0,4,0.17,3.83,0.33,0,0.33,0,0.33,0,0,10.67,6.33,0.33,0.17,1.33,0.67,3.83,4.17,0,0,0,1.5,4.67,2.83,1.5,0.33,1,0,0,1,0,0,0.33,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.17,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.83,0.17,2.33,15,1,2,11.17,0.83,0,0.83,4.17,4.33,3.83,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,18.83,5.33,4.33,0,0,1.17,8

But those of the past two weeks are unprecedented. For the first time, all three Eastern Slavic states — Belarus, Russia and Ukraine — are simultaneously involved. And the range of issues in play — military power, energy trade and migrant flows — is wider than ever. The region has become complex, unpredictable and increasingly dangerous. Two factors drive this. First, despite his suppression of last year’s nationwide demonstrations, Alexander Lukashenko knows that Belarus is not stable. Infuriated and threatened by the West’s sanctions and refusal to recognise him as president, he is seeking to intimidate rather than, as after previous crackdowns, restore relations with the West. The artificial migrant crisis, and empty threat to cut gas transit, reveal the futile desperation of an insecure despot whose judgement is deserting him. The Belarusian regime, long a dictatorship, is becoming a pariah. The second source of instability is Russia’s growing dissatisfaction with the status quo in Ukraine. Russia does not want to “freeze” the conflict it has fueled, but force further change. But while Russia remains publicly committed to the Minsk agreements — which according to its interpretation would federalize Ukraine and deepen Russian influence — it has no peaceful way to achieve this. Russia’s extraordinary decision, in breach of protocol, to publish recent correspondence with France and Germany suggests it is losing interest in diplomacy. Nor will its military buildup on Ukraine’s border by itself change minds in Berlin, Paris or Washington, let alone in Kiev. Russia’s only option is therefore a new military escalation. This would incur significant casualties and severe economic and financial sanctions. Yet Western leaders cannot assume that Putin weighs the risks as they might do in his shoes. His recent 5,000-word essay “On the historical unity of Russians and Ukrainians” points to ambitions that extend well beyond the matters addressed in the Minsk Agreements. Lukashenko’s struggle for survival and Putin’s designs on Ukraine are not only destabilising but connected. Despite their difficult relationship, Putin has a compelling interest in supporting Lukashenko: A free Belarus would not only seek better relations with the EU and Ukraine, but present the threat of a democratic example to Russia, as Ukraine’s revolutions in 2004 and 2014 did. Joint paratrooper exercises near the Polish border, Russia’s symbolic support with nuclear bomber overflights and the precedent of Russia’s own fabricated migrant crisis against Norway and Finland in 2015-16 all point to links between Russian and Belarusian policies.  Russia will also study reactions to Belarus’s actions to gauge Western resolve. Recent events have already produced significant effects. First, they show that Belarus and Russia can seize the initiative, threaten the status quo and precipitate crises that quickly become militarized. Second, they pose fresh tests for sanctions, a key Western policy tool. New EU measures seek to close down the complex supply chain of travel agencies, visa services and flights that enables Belarus to turn migrant misery into a novel form of de facto aggression against its neighbours. The West also seeks to use the prospect of severe future sanctions against Russia to avert a new invasion of Ukraine. Third, they mark the latest phase in a concerted Russian campaign of pressure against Europe that began soon after the Biden administration took office. In February, Russia threatened to cut off relations with the EU and humiliated High Representative Josep Borrell during his visit to Moscow. In April it conducted a massive troop buildup on Ukraine’s border. Last month it refused to supply extra gas to alleviate a temporary shortage, while suggesting that final approval of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline would resolve this. Russia could have reassured Europe of its reliability as a supplier by offering additional volumes — a smart move that might have eased Nord Stream 2 approval. Putin instead chose pressure over reassurance. He has since told the Foreign Ministry that Russia’s recent actions have produced a “certain tension” that “should be maintained as long as possible.” There is little sign that Russia seeks the “stable and predictable” relationship that America hopes for, and still less that Belarus will cease causing trouble for Europe.  On the contrary, a volatile mix of revanchism, insecurity, irrationality and military force is fueling tension and turbulence in the region. At worst, this could lead to the most serious crisis in Russian-Western relations in 40 years.",1,732,88.95,32.38,36.76,2.62,19.26,31.83,78.55,55.33,43.03,6.15,1.91,0,0,0,1.09,0.68,4.23,13.52,7.38,2.46,14.07,5.6,2.46,6.69,0.96,8.74,9.29,4.23,8.2,0.68,0.96,6.69,10.93,0.55,10.38,1.91,1.91,1.64,1.23,0,3.14,0,7.24,2.32,4.92,1.23,0.14,1.09,0.27,0.27,0,0,6.83,3.28,0.14,0,1.37,0.27,0.55,2.73,0,0,0,1.09,4.92,3.14,1.64,0.14,2.87,0.27,0.14,2.05,0.41,0.14,0.14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.14,0.82,0.27,0.14,0.27,0.14,0,0,1.91,0,3.01,9.56,0.82,0.96,6.97,0.27,0,0.55,6.01,1.5,3.28,1.37,0,0,0,0,0,14.07,5.19,4.92,0,0,2.05,1.91

Slaps Sanctions on Another Nord Stream 2 Firm,English,Russia,"The United States on Monday slapped sanctions on another company involved in the controversial Russia-Germany Nord Stream 2 pipeline even as it stops short of more drastic steps. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the United States was imposing sanctions on Transadria Ltd., a shipping company linked to Russia, as well as two vessels. President Joe Biden's administration took the action as part of a required report to Congress on action against the pipeline, which Ukraine and other Eastern European states fear will embolden Moscow and reduce their leverage. But Biden has waived sanctions on the main company behind Nord Stream, concluding that the pipeline will go ahead anyway and that it is better to work with Germany. ""Even as the administration continues to oppose the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, including via our sanctions, we continue to work with Germany and other allies and partners to reduce the risks posed by the pipeline,"" Blinken said in a statement. Germany, in a deal with the Biden administration, agreed to economic support to Ukraine on transitioning to clean energy and said it would insist that Russia keep gas flowing through its neighbor. The administration's approach has found wide opposition in the US Congress, with one Republican senator citing the issue to hold up State Department nominations.

Politicians in Europe have accused Moscow of withholding gas supplies in an attempt to accelerate approval for the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which links Russian gas fields to Germany via a mega pipeline under the Baltic Sea. Moscow says it is not manipulating the market and has pushed Europe to strike long-term supply deals with Gazprom if it wants to guarantee extra supplies. The company, Russia’s monopoly gas exporter, booked no additional transit capacity on either of the main transit routes to Europe through Belarus and Ukraine for the month of December, Russia’s state-run TASS news agency reported, citing data from European gas infrastructure operators. It was the third consecutive month of Gazprom booking no additional capacity on the routes, meaning the company could be intending to ship only the minimum amount of contracted supplies to the continent. Gazprom says its decisions over whether to book extra capacity are dictated by purchase agreements from gas buyers. Flows through Ukraine and Belarus have traditionally accounted for more than three-quarters of Gazprom’s supplies to the EU. However the company favors the Nord Stream pipeline, which does not incur high transit fees. The original Nord Stream, which started pumping gas in 2011, has accounted for 30% of Gazprom’s exports this year, according to Sova Capital, and is the only major transit route which has seen supply levels stable at maximum capacity throughout the year. European gas prices rose 10% in response to Gazpom not booking extra capacity through Ukraine and Belarus for December, with spot prices for gas still running at more than five times last year’s level. According to its own data, Gazprom has started to increase supplies to Europe in recent days, following a months-long process of replenishing storage facilities in Russia. Supplies to Europe were up 14% in the second week of November compared to the first week of the month. “​​We are starting to see the promised increase in flows to Europe, as well as some positive momentum in European underground storage. However, exports to Europe still lag in terms of flows versus historic levels,” said Sova Capital energy analyst Mitch Jennings. Gazprom’s gas exports to Europe are down by around 9% this year compared to the record supply year of 2018. But that comes against surging demand for power and after exports set all-time highs at the start of 2021, thus exacerbating the supply crunch which has hit markets this fall. Gazprom’s refusal to book additional transit capacity for December will keep the issue of Russia’s energy relations with Europe under the spotlight. It also comes at a time when Gazprom’s gas sales to China are surging. Shipments through the Power of Siberia pipeline, which connects Siberian gas fields to China’s energy network, are running 30% above contracted levels, the company said Monday. German regulators are currently assessing the recently completed Nord Stream 2 pipeline before it can be put into use. Officials said Monday they would consult Ukraine, which says it stands to lose $2 billion a year in transit fees from the pipeline, during that process. Russia says it is ready to start pumping gas as soon as it is given permission, and is eyeing a launch in early 2022.",1,566,97.41,18.67,60.68,18.15,25.73,30.04,74.2,54.77,41.87,4.24,0.35,0,0.18,0,0,0.18,3.89,10.42,7.07,3.18,18.9,4.95,2.47,4.24,0.88,10.95,4.42,6.36,3.53,0.18,0.35,3,7.42,0.71,6.36,0.53,0.88,0.71,0.18,0.35,3.89,0,1.59,0.71,0.88,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.42,3.18,0.18,0,0.53,0.18,1.94,0.35,0,0,0,0,1.24,0.35,0.88,0,6.18,0,0,4.24,2.3,0,0.53,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.18,0.35,0,0.88,0,0.18,0.18,0,3,9.89,0,2.65,7.07,0.53,0,0.18,6.18,2.47,5.65,0.88,0,0,0,0,0,12.37,3.89,4.42,0,0,1.77,2.3

Despite the sinister yet perplexing warnings coming from Washington and the certainties being paraded on every side by the pundits and the opinionated, we don’t know — and probably the Kremlin doesn’t know yet, either. As well as making open statements of concern and reaching out through multiple channels to Moscow, the U.S. administration has been reportedly briefing European allies about a massive reinforcement of Russian troops around Ukraine’s borders. The scenario is of 100 battalion tactical groups (BTGs) — the combined-arms mechanized units Russian army brigades generate to project force into conflict zones — or perhaps 90,000 troops, sweeping into Ukraine along multiple axes from Russia, Belarus and Crimea, in a massive strike supported by devastating airpower and long-range strikes. This would certainly be a major incursion and the implication is that it would have the objective of seizing large areas of territory or otherwise delivering a crippling blow to Ukrainian sovereignty. After all, Russia has almost 170 BTGs in permanent readiness overall, so this would represent almost two-thirds of its entire contingent. Yet buried amidst the assessment of a planned January or February assault is a crucial variable. As Bloomberg reported: The U.S. has shared intelligence including maps with European allies that shows a buildup of Russian troops and artillery to prepare for a rapid, large-scale push into Ukraine from multiple locations if President Vladimir Putin decided to invade, according to people familiar with the conversations. Quite. ‘If.’ The problem is that it is much easier to quantify capability than intent. Although there have been suggestions that this current troop build-up is being carried out more secretively than in spring, that really just means that the Russians are not making a media spectacle of it. That deployment — however much some prophesied an imminent invasion then, too — was much more clearly a political gesture. However, Moscow is well aware that the movement of thousands of troops and their associated armored vehicles, encampments and fuel bowsers can hardly be kept secret in an age of satellite surveillance and electronic eavesdropping. Forces are on the move, but so far nothing to explain the pitch of the American language (which implies they are working from some secret intelligence). Even according to Ukrainian military intelligence (GUR), there are only 40 BTGs currently around its borders, up from October’s tally, but lower than September’s (51), let alone April’s (53). That’s fewer than 40,000 soldiers — a BTG typically has a complement of 700-900 — although GUR chief Kyrylo Budanov claimed the total figure was actually 92,000. Even so, that is hardly the kind of superiority needed to take on a Ukrainian army that is now seasoned and well-trained and a quarter of a million strong, most of whom are in the Ground Forces. They may lack the higher-end capabilities of the Russians, but they would also be defending their homeland, and would be supplemented by volunteers and militias. It certainly isn’t the kind of force which could guarantee a quick and easy victory, and any attempt directly to take cities against collective local resistance — something the Russian army has never done in Ukraine — would be especially bloody. There is no way that the High Command cannot know that there would be many soldiers coming home crippled, wounded, or as ‘Cargo 200s’ — the dead. Nonetheless, if need be, the Russians could certainly build up a commanding force around Ukraine, and if Putin is willing to brave the international sanctions and condemnation and domestic outrage such a bloody war would generate, then an invasion can go ahead. But would it? Everyone knows what the Kremlin plans… With no way of knowing for sure what the Kremlin intends, observers tend to default to their operating assumptions. For those convinced Putin is an implacable foe of Ukrainian statehood, of course he is willing to pay any price to crush his foes. For those who see the most serious threat coming from Western warmongering, the U.S. position is simply making war more likely. One can frame an argument that says that Putin, eager to avoid further delegitimising his regime before the 2024 elections, would avoid such a war. One can frame one that says a war is how he would try to re-legitimate it. Focus on military balances of power and one can argue that, if Putin really does fear Ukraine’s westward drift and, especially, the danger that NATO forces would begin to be emplaced in the country – as he mused during his recent Valdai appearance, “what if missiles are stationed near Kharkov some day” under the guise of training bases? – then he may feel that delay will only make an eventual strike harder. Better to move sooner than later. Then again, maybe this is all another piece of political theatre to try and force Kiev to negotiate with Moscow on its terms, as Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council Secretary Oleksiy Danilov put it ‘to raise the table stakes of future talks.’ …Except the Kremlin The bottom line is that we do not know, and probably nor does the Kremlin. We are back to the usual metaphor of the opportunistic judoka versus the methodical chess grandmaster. This Russian administration does not tend to work on rigid, long term plans of the sort intended to bring about checkmate in 15 moves. Instead, it generates dynamic situations — which often means disrupting the status quo — and creates options for itself, so that it can seize opportunities and respond to threats as they arise. When the Russians built up their troops in spring, it was in part a rebuke and a warning to Kiev, and also a chance to see what concessions they might be able to extort. It’s highly unlikely they specifically had a summit meeting with President Biden in mind, but when that arose, they were happy to take the deal and stand down. Likewise, Putin probably has no clear and definite plan for 2022. It may be that there will be a war, although a full-scale invasion still seems an unlikely and dangerous move for a man who tends actually to be risk-averse. Alternatively, there may be some new talks — Minsk III? — or some quiet concessions. Or nothing may happen at all. The virtue of this kind of ambiguous menace is that it allows the Kremlin this option without having to look as if it is climbing down. Of course, if this happens then those crying ‘war!’ today can claim that it was only their vigilance and vehemence that made Moscow blink, just as the lack of an invasion in spring was presented as evidence of the power of the threat of sanctions, with equally little evidence. That will, however, be a small price to pay for avoiding another potential, bloody escalation.",1,1125,67.24,27,32.09,10.53,23.94,26.13,86.67,66.31,54.04,8.36,2.22,0,0.27,0,0.62,1.07,6.13,15.56,8.09,1.69,14.22,9.07,6.22,8.09,1.24,14.84,7.47,4,8.18,1.24,1.6,5.51,18.31,1.16,16.8,2.13,2.04,2.76,4.44,1.33,5.16,0,4.27,1.6,2.58,0.62,0.09,0.44,0.09,0.27,0.09,0.27,8,4,0.36,0,0.98,0.36,1.33,4,0,0,0,0.71,3.47,1.78,1.6,0.09,2.13,0.18,0.18,1.33,0.36,0.09,0.27,0.18,0.09,0.09,0,0,0,0,0.09,0.44,0,0.36,0.18,0,0,0.27,1.16,0.18,3.02,8.8,0.53,1.96,6.04,0.62,0.09,0.18,3.64,1.6,5.69,1.87,0,0,0,0,0,14.22,4.44,5.42,0.36,0.09,1.33,2.58

""The deadline for current payments is November 22... today, Gazprom notified the Moldovan side that in 48 hours gas supplies to Moldova will be stopped in accordance with the contract,"" Kupryanov said.  Moldova and Gazprom extended a deal to supply gas to the ex-Soviet country at the end of last month.  The deal was reached after a bitter stand-off that saw Chisinau declare a state of emergency over gas shortages and sign a gas contract with a country other than Russia for the first time.  On October 29, both sides said they agreed to extend their previous agreement by five years, with deliveries starting on November 1.  Kupryanov said Gazprom had signed a contract ""practically on the terms of the Moldovan side"", but on one condition: ""that Moldova completes one percent of its payments on time.""  He added that Gazprom was ""extremely disappointed with Moldova's failure to fulfil its contractual obligations.""  The agreement was reached after talks in Saint Petersburg between Moldova's Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Spinu and the Russian state-controlled firm's chief executive Alexei Miller.

Talk of a possible military confrontation between Russia and Ukraine has escalated in recent days, with Bloomberg reporting that U.S. intelligence has warned European allies a Russian invasion “on a scale far greater than seven years ago” could be “imminent.” The RTS Index — Russia’s main stock market, denominated in U.S. dollars — was down 4% by Monday afternoon, wiping billions off the valuations of Russia’s top companies. Banks were among the biggest fallers — seen as vulnerable to a devaluation in the ruble or introduction of new sanctions against Russia’s financial markets — along with energy giant Gazprom. The Russian ruble lost 1.1% against the U.S. dollar, trading at 74.4 — its lowest since August. The currency was down by a similar amount against the euro. Traders are also mulling the potential for a new round of sanctions against Russia.

""The difficult military and political situation in the world and the increased activity of NATO countries near the Russian borders require further quality development of the armed forces,"" Shoigu told officials in televised remarks. Among the Russian armed forces' priorities are ""increasing their effectiveness, maintaining the combat readiness of nuclear forces and strengthening the potential of non-nuclear deterrent forces,"" the defense minister added. Western countries have this month raised the alarm over reported Russian military activity near Ukraine, with the U.S. saying it has ""real concerns"" over a new troop build-up on the border. Moscow has dismissed mounting Western claims that Russia may be preparing to invade Ukraine and says any military buildup is a response to growing NATO activity near its borders. On Tuesday, Shoigu accused Washington of sending its bombers to practice a nuclear strike on Russia — from the east and the west — during its ""Global Thunder"" military exercises.

Around 110 countries have been invited to the virtual summit, including the United States' major Western allies, and snubbing Russia and China. The long-advertised meeting will take place online on Dec. 9 and 10 ahead of an in-person meeting at its second gathering next year. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the guest list, released Tuesday on the State Department website, showed that Washington ""prefers to create new dividing lines, to divide countries into those that — in their opinion — are good, and those that are bad."" ""More and more countries prefer to decide themselves how to live,"" Peskov told reporters, adding that Washington is ""trying to privatize the term 'democracy'."" The list of invitees from the former Soviet world includes Ukraine, Moldova, Armenia and Georgia as well as the three Baltic states that are now members of the European Union and NATO. Biden, who has made the struggle between democracies and ""autocratic governments"" a focal point of his foreign policy, pledged to hold the global conference during the 2020 presidential campaign. Russia’s snub comes amid tensions on multiple fronts between the two nuclear powers, with Washington blaming Moscow for a wave of cyberattacks, diplomat expulsions and election meddling. Moscow in turn labeled the U.S. an “unfriendly country” this spring, a move which Washington says forced it to halt all consular services within Russia.

Warns Russia Wagner Group Against Mali Meddling,English,Russia,"U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Saturday warned the shadowy Russian mercenary group Wagner over involvement in Mali as he pressed for a civilian transition in the troubled country. On a visit to Senegal, Blinken said that the United States was ""contributing to efforts with Mali and partners in support of stability"" in the war-ravaged country. ""I would only add that I think it would be especially unfortunate if outside actors engage in making things even more difficult and more complicated, and I'm thinking in particular of the Wagner group,"" he said. The private military outfit, which Western capitals see as closely linked to the Kremlin, has been tied to conflicts in Ukraine, Africa and the Middle East. France has been spearheading moves to target Wagner after its reported deal with Mali's military junta to send 1,000 contractors to help in a longstanding conflict with jihadists. West African regional group ECOWAS earlier this month slapped sanctions on individual members of the military junta ruling Mali since the August 2020 seizure of power.

In the letter, dated April 20, 1787, and addressed to a count, the German-born ruler who expanded Russia's territory provides detailed instructions to authorities in present-day Ukraine on how to organize an effective inoculation campaign. Auction house MacDougall's, which specializes in Russian art, put the letter and a portrait of Catherine on public display in Moscow on Friday before the pieces go on sale in London. The document and portrait are estimated to have a joint worth of up to $1.6 million. Held until now in an anonymous private collection, they will be shown at a Moscow gallery until Nov. 30 and will go up for auction in London on Dec. 1. ""One of the most important (tasks) should be the introduction of inoculation against smallpox, which, as we know, causes great harm, especially among ordinary people,"" Catherine wrote to Count Pyotr Rumyantsev, reportedly on a trip to Crimea. ""Such inoculation should be common everywhere,"" she wrote in neat Cyrillic, signing ""Catherine"" in large script. She goes on to provide details on how to make vaccinations widely available, including by setting up temporary accommodation in monasteries for those who fall ill after being jabbed. The Empress was the first person in Russia to be vaccinated against smallpox. ""In today's conditions, we should be very proud of Catherine,"" the auction house's co-director and Russian art expert Yekaterina MacDougall told reporters during a press viewing on Thursday. While President Vladimir Putin says he was vaccinated with Russia's home-grown Sputnik V vaccine, he took months into the pandemic to do so – and some have criticized him for not doing so on camera. The Empress had organized an ""unreal"" propaganda campaign to encourage her subjects to be jabbed against smallpox, which was decimating populations across Europe at the time. But, ""as a very intelligent woman,"" MacDougall said Catherine stopped short of mandating vaccinations. ""She knew that the Russian people would rebel against this."" During the Covid-19 pandemic, many Russians have also rebelled against Kremlin instructions, refusing to vaccinate themselves against the virus. Despite repeated pleas from Putin, only 40% of Russians are fully vaccinated. Catherine's letter is ""unique, especially given this situation we are all in,"" historian Oleg Khromov told reporters via video link, adding that it was a ""miracle"" that it had survived. Catherine, scared of dying of smallpox like many around her, had a doctor come from England to give her the smallpox vaccine. Khromov said doctors used a sample from a child to inject Catherine with the disease. The youngster was later rewarded with a title. She was then sick for some time and when she recovered, imperial authorities put out a decree saying the Empress was feeling well and urged others to follow her. But Khromov said that despite her efforts to convince Russians to get vaccinated, ""people were scared, it was new and unusual."" When France's Louis XV died of smallpox in 1774, Catherine reportedly said it was ""barbarism"" to die of the disease in the enlightened 18th century. ""I very much hope that one day, maybe in the near future, we can say: 'What barbarism to die of Covid in the 21st century',"" Yekaterina MacDougall said.

The other countries still on the U.S. list for ""religious freedom violations"" are Myanmar, Eritrea, Iran, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. Algeria, Comoros, Cuba and Nicaragua were placed on a watch list. ""The United States will not waiver in its commitment to advocate for freedom of religion or belief for all and in every country,"" Blinken said in a statement. ""In far too many places around the world, we continue to see governments harass, arrest, threaten, jail, and kill individuals simply for seeking to live their lives in accordance with their beliefs."" The latest annual report by U.S. diplomats on religious freedom highlighted the Russian government's ""misuse of the law on extremism to restrict the peaceful activities of religious minorities."" ""Religious groups and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) reported authorities continued to investigate, detain, imprison, torture, and/or physically abuse persons or seize their property because of their religious faith,"" it said. Among those classified by Russia as extremist and banned are the Christian group Jehovah's Witnesses and the Muslim group Hizb ut-Tahrir. Tensions between the United States and Russia have increased recently despite upbeat declarations made by leaders Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin at a June summit in Geneva. Washington has recently warned Moscow over military activities near Ukraine and over its alleged influence in the Belarus-Poland border crisis — as well as Russia's ""dangerous and irresponsible"" strike on a satellite.

The ruble sank 2% against major currencies by Friday lunchtime in Moscow trading, hitting a seven-month low of 75.7 against the U.S. dollar and 85.2 against the euro.  The sell-off caps a punishing week for Russian markets, which started with what traders have dubbed “black Monday” — a day of heavy losses prompted by fears of military confrontation between Russia and Ukraine.  Russia’s stock market has now lost 16% over the past four weeks.  Several countries have restricted travel to South Africa and a number of other African countries, where the new strain of the coronavirus, named “Nu,” was first discovered.  Scientists say the new variant has more mutations on the virus’ protein spike than even the highly-transmissible Delta variant, prompting fears it could be better able to evade vaccines and extend the pandemic.  Russia’s main stock market, the dollar-denominated RTS index, slumped by more than 4% in the first hours of trading Friday as investors took stock of the news and potential impact on the global economy. Russia followed other major markets lower, with the main stock indices in London and Frankfurt also down by more than 3%. Traders in the U.S. are also braced for big losses when markets open later Friday.  In Russia, commodities companies were the biggest fallers, heading lower after a 5% fall in the price of oil, as traders fear travel restrictions and new lockdowns could be on the way.  South Africa is on Russia’s list of countries with which air travel has been restored following a complete closure of Russia’s borders at the start of the coronavirus pandemic last year. The Russian Embassy in South Africa said Friday it was following the situation, but was not advising Russians to stop travelling to the country, the state-run TASS news agency reported. The Kremlin has previously shut down travel to virus hot spots and areas where new variants have been discovered, banning flights to Britain following the discovery of the Alpha strain last December, for instance.

The pipeline, which was completed earlier this year after months of delays and setbacks amid U.S. sanctions designed to thwart it, needs approval from German authorities before it can be put into use. The German regulator said it could not proceed with certification of the pipeline because Nord Stream 2 AG, the Gazprom-controlled company which owns the pipeline, is registered in Switzerland, not Germany. “Following a thorough examination of the documentation, the Bundesnetzagentur concluded that it would only be possible to certify an operator of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline if that operator was organised in a legal form under German law,” the regulator said in a statement Tuesday. Gazprom’s share price dropped 2% on the news, which comes as Europe faces a gas supply crunch, with Russia accused of withholding supplies in a bid to force approval for Nord Stream 2. Nord Stream 2 AG has agreed to set up a German subsidiary to govern the German part of the pipeline, the regulator said in its statement. “The certification procedure will remain suspended until the main assets and human resources have been transferred to the subsidiary.” Once that process is completed, the certification period will resume. Under German law, the regulator has four months to review documentation and make a decision on whether to approve the pipeline. It is the latest setback for Nord Stream 2, which has been beset with delays and hold-ups in recent years amid escalating tensions between Russia and the West. The pipeline has been heavily criticized by many European countries, including key German ally France, as well as Poland and the Baltic States, who see it as a Russian geopolitical weapon. Washington’s hostility to the project drove a wedge between the U.S. and Germany under the Donald Trump administration. New U.S. President Joe Biden struck a deal earlier this year with Germany to drop opposition to the project, with Germany pledging to support Ukraine, which stands to lose up to $2 billion a year in lucrative transit fees. The new pipeline, which connects Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea runs alongside the existing Nord Stream gas link. When launched, the two pipelines could account for 60% of Russia’s gas exports to Europe.

Around 2,000 people, mainly from the Middle East, are estimated to be living near the Poland-Belarus border in dire conditions and desperate to cross into the European Union. The EU says Belarus engineered the crisis in retaliation for sanctions on the ex-Soviet country. Minsk and its main ally Russia have rejected the charges and criticized the EU for not taking in the migrants seeking to cross over. ""We call on the regime to cease immediately its aggressive and exploitative campaign,"" the EU and foreign ministers of the G7 global powers said. But Belarus has said it wants to de-escalate the crisis. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's spokeswoman Natalya Eismont said on Thursday that there were currently around 7,000 migrants in the country. She said Belarus will send 5,000 of the migrants home, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel will negotiate with the EU on creating ""a humanitarian corridor to Germany"" for the 2,000 on the border. There was no immediate reaction from Germany. A repatriation flight with between 200 and 300 migrants on board took off from Belarus on Thursday bound for Erbil in Iraqi Kurdistan and Baghdad. The flight traveling to Baghdad is carrying 431 people, Russia's Interfax news agency reported. In the latest border incident, the Polish defense ministry said that Belarusian forces had first carried out reconnaissance and ""most likely"" damaged the barbed wire fence along the border. ""Then the Belarusians forced the migrants to throw stones at Polish soldiers to distract them. The attempt to cross the border took place several hundred meters away,"" it said. ""Belarusian special forces led yesterday's attack,"" it said. The border guard said a total of around 500 migrants took part in the attempted crossing and 200 of them were detained after crossing into Poland successfully. It said a family of five people, including three children aged between seven and nine, had been injured in the incident and were taken to hospital. Video footage released by the defense ministry appeared to show Polish soldiers surrounding a large group of migrants crouched down in a wooded area at night next to barbed wire. The incident could not be independently verified as journalists are banned from the immediate border area on the Polish side. Lukashenko, who has cracked down on political opponents and independent media for nearly three decades, has spoken twice to Merkel about the crisis in recent days. Lukashenko's press service on Wednesday said the Belarus leader and Merkel ""agreed that the problem as a whole will be brought up to the level of Belarus and the EU."" The Polish government has warned against any agreement on the crisis that might be struck ""over our heads."" Poland's state-run TVP network also on Thursday began broadcasting a new English-language channel TVP World, bringing forward the launch to ""show the whole world the truth"" about the migrant crisis on the Poland-Belarus border. Meanwhile British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said he would stand ""shoulder to shoulder"" with Poland during a visit to a military base in northeast Poland that hosts a NATO battlegroup. A squadron of British military engineers is expected in Poland later this month to help with border fencing and repairing roads in the area, Polish Defense Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said. Aid groups say at least 11 migrants have died since the crisis began in the summer. Polish medical workers said they had assisted a Syrian couple in the early hours of Thursday who had been in the forest for one and a half months. ""Their one-year-old child died in the forest,"" the Polish Center for International Aid said on Twitter. In another incident, video footage released by Belarusian border guards showed a Lithuanian border guard dog biting a man lying on the ground in a sleeping bag. Lithuania's boder guard admitted to the incident, saying that they were attempting to push back a group of migrants into Belarus and that the border guard did not see the migrant.

It’s become unhelpful at best and dangerous at worst, both in terms of understanding what Belarus is doing and the wider issue of Russia’s role in the neighborhood and beyond. Since the summer, Belarus has been enabling migrants, mostly from the Middle East, to travel through the country, huddling them up against the Polish border, even as President Alexander Lukashenko threatened to bring a migrant crisis to his neighbour’s doorstep. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki called Vladimir Putin the mastermind of the crisis, with officials and commentators widely describing the standoff as part of Putin’s “hybrid warfare” playbook. But not only does this language hobble our ability to really do anything about this human tragedy, let alone make sense of it. The very rhetoric of war risks bringing war closer. Ultimately, we cannot know what goes on in the conversations between Putin and his client Lukashenko and our feeble attempts to ascribe intent are based on conjecture. This week, Belarus restricted oil through the Druzhba pipeline to Poland and it emerged that Lukashenko, in his phone call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, allegedly demanded recognition and an end to sanctions in exchange for ending the crisis. Are all of these things, the migrants, the threats, the oil restrictions, part of some grand, coordinated onslaught managed from Moscow, or simply a series of retaliations for sanctions by a wavering dictator with no clear plan? The move to restrict oil really put Russian pipeline monopoly Transneft on the spot. In his statement, the company’s representatives called the Belarus repairs “unscheduled,” in effect distancing itself from this decision. The Kremlin, of course, is silent. Which doesn’t mean it’s pleased. That means literally: it may not necessarily mean anything at all. To know means to presume that Lukashenko knows exactly what he’s doing, that he approved this decision with Moscow, and that there’s some kind of reasonable plan. I’m not so certain. After all, Putin has warned against Minsk threatening to cut off oil and gas supplies to Europe as a move that will risk the already shaky relations between Russia and Belarus. More to the point, Lukashenko has a history of threatening Moscow as well. Let’s assume that Lukashenko and Putin are coordinating all these actions and statements, and especially that it’s part of a larger power play against European countries that also, absurdly, includes Russian troop build up on the Ukrainian border — but to achieve what, exactly? End sanctions? That scenario presumes a Kremlin that is either incredibly stupid or exceedingly smart, and that it’s adopted a strategy of three-dimensional chess that would make anyone’s head spin, and that its relations with Lukashenko are seamless and trustworthy. But none of these things are true. In my 20 years of writing about Russian foreign policy, I have yet to witness Putin thinking more than two steps ahead. Chess is probably the worst analogy for Putin’s behavior on the world stage, let alone for Lukashenko, who has a history of angering everyone around him, including Putin, without any clear plan. Perhaps Lukashenko had something of a plan prior to August 2020, when a particularly rigged election sparked mass protests and repressions that ultimately stripped the leader of much of his legitimacy. Until then he had been playing bait and switch with Moscow, oscillating between the Russians and the West in attempts to haggle out some choice energy subsidies from Russia. If it was a strategy, it failed because Moscow itself ultimately got tired of his unreliability and cut back on the subsidies. Since then, supporting Lukashenko has been a chore for the Kremlin, but a chore it can’t seem to let up precisely because when U.S. and EU officials and commentators make irresponsible comments tying up Lukashenko and Putin in some kind of wholesale “hybrid war” against the west it only vindicates Kremlin paranoias. Alas, Mark Galeotti has been one of the few voices to make the obvious point that making Putin responsible for Lukashenko has the effect of pushing them together. But I would also argue that our very fixation on the term “hybrid war” to describe what is happening is making the problem worse, and muddling what is actually going on. Do Lukashenko’s actions theoretically constitute hybrid warfare? Possibly. Maybe. Likely. But here’s the problem. What is even a hybrid war? Simply put, it is being nasty to your neighbor or another country by using non-military means together with military ones. By definition, most wars are hybrid wars in that they involve propaganda, diplomacy or politics. But the non-kinetic, non-conventional components of a hybrid war — disinformation, lawfare, political shenanigans, even political destabilization campaigns — also happen outside of the state which we commonly regard as war. We are in effect describing peacetime behavior as war, implicitly suggesting that kinetic aggression is the next stage in the plan. What could possibly go wrong? The recent hybrid war fad emerged when Russian military officials started talking about it as something that the United States was doing to Russia and other countries. It then deployed hybrid tactics in Ukraine to counter what it believed was a Western hybrid war. In other words, hybrid war emerged as a talking point of Russian propaganda. While it may be useful to look at what Russia did in Ukraine in 2014 through the lens of hybridity, I don’t believe that everything Russia has been doing since then constitutes some kind of wholesale hybrid war against the West. To say so, we are in effect parroting and amplifying Russian propaganda. We have become locked in a vicious and dangerous feedback loop by qualifying every selfish and nasty thing that Russia or its allies do as part of “hybrid war.” Russia is doing the same. The result is political escalation and the increasing fear, if not threat, of real war, as Leonid Ragozin wrote in bne IntelliNews. How about we all stop? As journalists, analysts, and policymakers, isn’t it our job to make sense of facts, and to avert, rather than exacerbate, crises? And not to write screenplays for future Netflix war epics? While it has its uses, the hybrid war concept has already been coming under criticism by scholars. But its damage lies outside the academe. Its (ab)use by officials and pundits who see an all-powerful Putin lurking around every corner, of a grand plan to destroy western values every time a dictator does something nasty, amounts only to epic that deflects from the difficult and often boring work needed to solve serious problems that demagogues everywhere — and yes, that also includes the Polish Prime Minister — love to politically exploit. When it comes to Russia, its role in potentially helping solve this particular crisis is more limited than many tend to assume. Putting pressure on Russia over Lukashenko will only backfire. But drawing it into talks — while offering something in return — may offer a limited benefit. Putin has offered to mediate the crisis and, to an extent, may already be doing so. It may not entirely change Lukashenko’s behavior — the Kremlin’s brokering potential is ever more modest than it sometimes makes it out to be — but it may make it more difficult for him to get away with it. But to work, either Germany, the EU, or whatever body that will be brokering this mediation will need to discard its assumptions about some kind of Russian hybrid war against the West before it approaches Moscow. Contrary to the widely popular idea that Putin can stop Lukashenko whenever he wants, the reality is that forcing someone to do something is always hard, costly work. Moscow will obviously be looking for something in return. Russia may continue to believe whatever it wants about the West waging a hybrid war against it. It doesn’t mean that the EU and the U.S. have to continue believing the same.

The EU has accused the Belarusian government of shipping Middle Eastern migrants toward Poland to force the bloc to drop sanctions imposed after the disputed victory of longtime leader Alexander Lukashenko in presidential elections. Poland, in turn, says Russia, Belarus’s only major ally and key political and economic backer, orchestrated the crisis. But despite ongoing Russian support for Lukashenko, who faced down unprecedented protests against his 27-year rule over Belarus last year, analysts from the two countries cast doubt on the idea that Russia has contrived the migration crisis, saying Moscow’s position on its neighbor is complex and often contradictory. “I don’t think Lukashenko needed any push from Russia to act in this way,” said Artyom Shraibman, a Belarusian political analyst based in Ukraine. “He has been threatening to unleash the flow of migrants for many years before 2021.” “But then, if Moscow had wanted to stop Lukashenko, it could have done so,” added Shraibman. The roots of the present crisis go back to August 2020. When Lukashenko claimed a landslide victory in his bid for a sixth term in office, the opposition cried foul and Belarus was plunged into uproar. As security forces resorted to vicious violence to put down unprecedentedly large protests, the EU — in particular Belarus’s neighbors Poland and Lithuania — threw their weight behind Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, the opposition candidate who said she defeated Lukashenko at the polls. The aftermath of the election, which saw sanctions imposed on Belarus and Lukashenko rendered persona non grata in Europe, spelled the end of Minsk’s decades-long policy of balancing relations between Russia and Europe to extract concessions from both. Instead, Russian President Vladimir Putin, seeing in Lukashenko a guarantee that Belarus would not follow Ukraine in aligning with the West, stepped in offering economic and political support that proved crucial in thwarting the Belarusian protest movement. The result, however, was to leave Lukashenko, who had always jealously guarded his country’s independence, profoundly reliant on Putin, with whom he has reportedly had difficult personal relations. Among Russian experts, there is broad agreement that the migration crisis is Lukashenko’s bid to force Europe to talk to him, and therefore to lessen his dependence on Russia. “Throughout this crisis, Lukashenko has been trying to force the West into dialogue,” said Andrei Kortunov, head of the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC), a Kremlin-aligned think tank. Russia’s contradictory moves throughout the crisis — signaling support for Lukashenko with military drills in Belarus while also coordinating with European leaders to defuse the crisis — point to the Kremlin’s complex position on Belarus, which aims to keep Lukashenko in office while preventing him from resuming his traditional independence. “Lukashenko wants to put some distance between Minsk and Moscow and to increase his freedom for maneuver independent of Russia,” said Kortunov. “It would be strange if Putin supported him in that.” For some experts, Russia’s guarded support for Lukashenko reflects the Belarusian president’s own weakness, and the improbability of his scheme bearing fruit. “Russia doesn’t need to publicly abandon Lukashenko because the chances of him actually managing to force the EU to restore relations were always very minimal,” said Maxim Samorukov, a scholar of post-Communist Eastern Europe at the Moscow Carnegie Center. For Samorukov, Lukashenko’s continued pariah status in Europe means his migration gambit was never likely to achieve his goals. “It’s quite clear that a phone call with Merkel isn’t the same as sanctions relief, or a reset in relations,” he added, referring to Lukashenko’s call with the outgoing German chancellor this week, the first since his disputed re-election. With the EU unanimous in its support for Poland’s actions despite Warsaw’s strained relations with Brussels, and Middle Eastern countries shutting down flights to Minsk under EU pressure, some conclude that Lukashenko’s bid to force his neighbours into dealing with him has failed. “Lukashenko wanted the Europeans to realize what good relations with Belarus had given them in terms of border security,” said political analyst Shraibman. “I don’t think it has worked in the way he intended.” However, regardless of Lukashenko’s isolation, some Russian experts feel that the Belarusian strongman is becoming a liability for Moscow’s interests. “The main goal of Russian policy in Belarus isn’t to annex Belarus, but to make sure Belarus doesn’t move toward the West,” said Carnegie’s Samorukov. “On the one hand, Lukashenko is an iron-cast guarantee that won’t happen. But on the other, Russia also understands that Lukashenko’s behavior is itself becoming a risk factor.” It has not gone unnoticed in Moscow that the migration standoff is Lukashenko’s second self-inflicted crisis in a year. In May, the forced grounding of a Ryanair jet flying over Belarus and the arrest of an opposition journalist onboard provoked international outrage and led to Belarus’s transport links with the outside world being almost entirely severed. In the last week, experts have pointed to Lukashenko’s threat to shut off the Yamal pipeline, which carries Russian gas through Belarus to Europe, as particularly disturbing for Moscow at a time when gas supplies to the EU are a sensitive issue. Putin, in an interview with Russian state TV, publicly rebuked Lukashenko for the pipeline threat, dismissing his Belarusian ally as “overly emotional.” According to Samorukov, Lukashenko’s increasingly erratic conduct has the Kremlin set on a gradual, stage-managed transition of power in Minsk ahead of presidential elections scheduled for 2025. “There’s no need for him to go imminently, but everyone now understands that Lukashenko shouldn’t run for another term,” said Samorukov. “That would be the single biggest risk to Russian interests in Belarus.” With Lukashenko having publicly committed himself — with Russian endorsement — to an as-yet vague program of constitutional reform to be approved by referendum, some see a mechanism by which Belarus’s first and so far only president could formally retire, even while maintaining a degree of control over his country. “Every time you hear a Russian official talk about constitutional reform in Belarus, they’re saying that Lukashenko has to go,” said Samorukov.",1,1015,94.41,43.54,23.76,10.47,26.71,34.78,77.34,55.57,43.94,6.8,3.45,0.2,0,0.1,2.46,0.3,3.35,12.91,7.59,0.99,17.14,5.12,2.76,4.43,1.18,11.92,4.63,2.76,6.7,0.59,1.58,5.22,10.54,0.79,9.66,1.77,1.58,1.28,1.28,0.59,2.96,0,5.02,1.97,2.96,0.59,0.1,0.39,0,0.2,0.1,0,10.84,5.42,1.08,0,1.48,0.3,2.36,4.83,0,0.3,0.1,2.36,6.21,3.05,2.86,0.3,2.46,0.1,0.3,1.87,0.2,0,0.39,0.1,0,0.1,0,0,0,0.1,0,1.48,0.39,0.1,0,0,0,0.3,1.77,0.3,2.46,10.54,0.39,2.17,7.59,0.49,0.1,0.2,3.25,3.65,3.45,0.89,0,0,0,0,0,18.13,3.74,6.6,0,0,3.55,4.24
570,themoscowtimes.com,1638000000,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/11/27/spice-things-up-with-adjika-a75684,Spice Things Up With Adjika - The Moscow Times,English,Russia,"This week I gave the fridge a very thorough going over, the kind of special operation where I take absolutely everything out, and give the shelves and drawers a good scrub, as well as the sticky collection of jars that crowd my top shelf. It did not surprise me to find three almost empty jars of adjika, which, alas, could not be combined, as they were all different. I threw the contents of the spiciest into a plastic bag of marinating pork, smeared the other on a grilled cheese sandwich for lunch, and mixed the third together with kefir and lemon juice to make salad dressing. And as I did so, it reminded me of how versatile and enjoyable adjika can be. But what is adjika exactly? I’ve heard adjika called everything from “Georgian pesto,” to “Russian salsa,” to “Kyrgyz harissa.” Adjika is none of these things, of course, though harissa is the closest analogy. Adjika is a chili paste, tempered with garlic, salt, and a few signature Caucasian spices. Though the Georgians have eagerly claimed this beloved regional condiment as their own, adjika is originally from Abkhazia, the autonomous republic of the South Caucasus, which, come to think of it, the Georgians also claim as their own. Adjika in Abkhaz means “salt,” and the condiment’s story begins with Abkhazian shepherds, who fed salt to their grazing sheep to increase their appetites and thus fatten them up. Because salt was an expensive commodity, the shepherds mixed it with the region’s ubiquitous red peppers, later adding wild herbs and garlic to the mixture. The best adjika is hand ground with stones, though today, most people take the straightforward route and use a food processor or meat grinder. Adjika’s appeal has spread far beyond the pasturelands of Abkhazia. The spicy, salty condiment was adopted (the Abkhazians might use the word “appropriated”) by the republic’s neighbors in the region, where adjika is a popular ingredient for soups, stews, and marinades, and an essential condiment, appearing on the table to liven up everything from a dish of beans to a full lamb roasted on a spit. As adjika traveled north through the vast Russian empire, it was further adapted with ingredients that no Caucasian would ever dream of including. In Ukraine, I have encountered “adjika” made with peppers, carrots, apples, honey, and tomatoes, while Russians add copious amounts of dill to a heavily tomato-based sauce and also call that adjika. Clearly across the years and kilometers, the word “adjika” has taken on a generic meaning for a piquant sauce or condiment. It is just as impossible to pin down a definitive, authoritative recipe for adjika as it is one for Pesto Genovese, but the essential ingredients are red peppers (both bell and chili), salt, garlic, coriander, blue fenugreek, and calendula or dried marigold flowers. The hottest, spiciest adjika, used predominantly in cooking, is heavy on the chili peppers and their seeds: a pepper’s heat comes from its seeds, so you can always gage the relative spiciness of adjika by the number of seeds in it. Milder versions of adjika are served at table as dips or spreads, the fire dampened by the exclusion of the seeds and a generous addition of walnuts. Green adjika is less common, perhaps because its key ingredients — green peppers and fresh herbs — are more perishable and thus more challenging to preserve and transport. But green adjika is no less delicious with its dominant notes of garlic and fresh herbs, making it a superb marinade for lamb, fish, and poultry. This is the adjika I turn to when all about me is cold, dark, and grey and I need a reminder of the bright sun and intoxicating air of the south. As we grapple with faulty supply chains throughout the world, increasingly I am setting myself the challenge of making things from scratch, particularly essentials I used to pick up at retail outlets or buy online. And so it is now with adjika, which I always want to have on hand. There are so many things this versatile sauce/condiment can do, from livening up a bowl of cottage cheese to marinating pork. Pair it with leftover roast turkey or chicken as a marvelous zingy note or slather it on a well-grilled steak instead of garlic butter. I love to serve mild adjika as a dip on its own or swirled around a bowl of hummus or labneh. It is a marvelous addition to a charcuterie board, an omelet, tucked inside a pita sandwich, or on top of a side dish of grains. Stuff jacket potatoes with either one of the adjikas listed below, or dip small meatballs in a shallow bowl of either of these versions of Abkhazia’s incomparable condiment. However you choose to enjoy them, may they bring sunshine and warmth to you! *Note: This milder version or adjika is primarily used as a spread rather than a sauce. Its distinctly orange color comes from the calendula or dried marjoram leaves and the addition of walnuts.

Warns Russia of  High - Impact  Sanctions If It Invades Ukraine,English,Russia,"U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that Washington had seen ""evidence"" Russia could be planning an invasion of Ukraine, threatening Moscow with painful economic sanctions if it attacks. Blinken accused Moscow of massing ""tens of thousands of additional combat forces"" near Ukraine's border as he geared up for talks with Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Stockholm over the crisis. ""We're deeply concerned by evidence that Russia has made plans for significant aggressive moves against Ukraine, plans include efforts to destabilise Ukraine from within as well as large scale military operations,"" he said after a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Latvia's capital Riga. ""Now, we don't know whether President (Vladimir) Putin has made the decision to invade. We do know that he's putting in place the capacity to do so on short order, should he so decide,"" he said. Blinken insisted ""diplomacy is the only responsible way to resolve this potential crisis"" but warned there would be ""far-reaching and long-lasting consequences"" for Moscow if it pushed ahead with any aggression. ""We made it clear to the Kremlin that we will respond resolutely, including with a range of high-impact economic measures that we've refrained from using in the past,"" Blinken said. Kiev's Western allies have been sounding the alarm since last month over a fresh Russian troop buildup around Ukraine's borders and a possible winter invasion. Russia, which seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and backs separatists fighting Kiev, has strongly denied it is plotting an attack and blames NATO for fuelling tensions. Moscow on Wednesday hit back by accusing Ukraine of massing tens of thousands of troops in the country's east, as worries grow over an escalation. The allegations came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for direct talks with Moscow over the festering conflict with Russian-backed separatists in the east of his country. ""We must tell the truth that we will not be able to end the war without direct talks with Russia,"" Zelensky said during an annual address to lawmakers in Kiev. More than 13,000 people have been killed in a war that began in 2014 between Ukraine and pro-Russian separatists, who have carved out two ""People's Republics"" in eastern Ukraine. In Moscow, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov appeared to pour cold water on the idea, reiterating that the war was a domestic problem in Ukraine. ""We know of attempts to present Russia as a party to this conflict. This is not the case,"" Peskov told reporters. ""The war in Donbass can only be stopped through negotiations between Ukrainians and Ukrainians."" A senior U.S. official on Wednesday urged a ""complete ceasefire"" on the Donbass conflict over Christmas. ""With the Christmas season coming, this is a time for a resumption of complete ceasefire, for prisoner exchange and for re-opening of crossing points so that families can visit,"" Victoria Nuland, the U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs told a security forum in Kiev via a video link. ""We have been encouraging both Moscow and Kiev to work together on a package of those kinds of measures,"" Nuland added. Putin has warned the West and Kiev against crossing the Kremlin's ""red lines"" over staging military exercises and building up weaponry in Ukraine. Blinken insisted in Riga that NATO allies were ""making sure that Ukraine has the means to defend itself."" And he said that the alliance would ""look at what it needs to do in the event of further Russian aggression, to shore up its own defenses"" as NATO eyes bolstering forces along its eastern flank. Blinken said Russia was using the same ""playbook"" it employed when it took control of Crimea, including by intensifying ""disinformation"" to portray Kiev as the ""aggressor"". The foreign minister of Ukraine – which has seen its bid for membership in NATO stall – urged the U.S.-led alliance for a ""deterrence package"" to stop Russia as he attended the meeting in Riga. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell also pledged the bloc ""will be standing firmly and decisively with Ukraine in front of any attempt to undermine its territorial integrity and sovereignty.""

Speaking in his annual address to the Ukrainian parliament on Wednesday, Zelenskiy said the return of Crimea to Ukraine following Moscow’s 2014 annexation of the peninsula should be the country’s main goal — but stopped short of saying it should be retaken by force. “We see this as a direct threat to Russia,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying by Interfax. “Such wording means that the regime in Kiev intends to use all available possibilities, including force, in order to encroach on a Russian region."" In addition to the conflict over the annexation of Crimea, Kiev has been locked in a nearly eight-year war with pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine that has claimed over 13,000 lives. Ukraine and its Western allies accuse Russia of sending arms and funding to the rebels, claims Mosow denies. Tensions have ratcheted up significantly between Ukraine and Russia in recent weeks, with Kiev accusing Moscow of massing forces near their shared border and the United States warning of a possible Russian invasion. Russia, in turn, has accused Ukraine of massing troops near southeastern Ukraine, and NATO of provocations. Zelenskiy on Wednesday called for direct talks with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to end the escalation. “Let’s be honest, the war in Donbass has been going on for eight years. Eight years since Russia annexed Crimea,” Zelenskiy said. “We must talk, knowing that we have a strong and powerful army.” Kiev's Western allies have warned that Russia could use a perceived threat to its security as pretext for an invasion of Ukraine. ""The likelihood of hostilities in Ukraine is still high,"" Peskov said Thursday. ""This remains a matter of particular concern and worry for us. We are seeing an increase in the intensity of provocative actions on the contact line."" Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) said Thursday it had detained three alleged Ukrainian spies who it said were gathering secrets and plotting terrorist attacks. The chief diplomats of the U.S. and Russia are due to meet in Sweden on Thursday, where they are likely to discuss the escalation in tensions with Ukraine.

More than 13,000 people have been killed in a war between Kiev troops and Russian-backed separatists who have carved out two ""People's Republics"" in eastern Ukraine. Kiev and its Western allies have accused Russia of stirring up the separatist conflict to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and the EU and sending troops and arms to support the breakaway regions. Moscow has denied those claims. The war broke out after a popular uprising in Kiev ousted a Kremlin-backed president and Moscow moved to annex Crimea in 2014. Even though active fighting has decreased, the West has been concerned by Russia's troop movements on Ukraine's border this year. Kiev's Western allies have since last month warned of a fresh Russian troop buildup around Ukraine's borders and a possible winter invasion. The alleged surge follows a similar buildup in the spring, when Russia gathered around 100,000 troops on Ukraine's borders but later announced a drawdown. At the peak of those tensions Zelenskiy invited the Russian leader to meet for talks in eastern Ukraine, but the Kremlin declined the invitation. Russian officials in turn have accused Kiev of massing tens of thousands of troops near separatist-controlled territory. ""The Armed Forces of Ukraine are building up their military strength, massing heavy equipment and personnel,"" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Wednesday. ""According to some reports, the number of Ukrainian troops in the conflict zone has already reached 125,000 personnel,"" she claimed, saying this represented half of Kiev's troops. Those comments followed the Ukrainian foreign ministry saying Tuesday that Russia has massed 115,000 troops around Ukraine, on the Crimean peninsula and in two eastern regions occupied by the breakaway fighters. Putin on Tuesday declined to say whether Moscow planned to move troops across Ukraine's border. ""Look, they spoke about a possible Russian military intervention in Ukraine at the beginning of the year. But as you see this did not happen,"" Putin said. The Russian leader added that the security interests of all parties should be taken into account and called for improved ties.

Urges De - Escalation on Ukraine as Russia Warns of  Nightmare Scenario  ",English,Russia,"Top U.S. diplomat Antony Blinken on Thursday warned Russia against invading Ukraine, as Moscow told Kiev that any attempt to retake the Crimean peninsula amounted to a ""direct threat"" to Russia. Western powers have been sounding the alarm in recent weeks about Russia massing troops along the border with Ukraine, further stoking tensions in an area where a long-running conflict has already left 13,000 dead. Moscow, which is accused of backing the separatists fighting Kiev, has denied preparing an attack and accuses NATO of raising the temperature. ""We have deep concerns about Russia's plans for renewed aggression against Ukraine,"" Blinken told Lavrov in talks on Thursday near Stockholm, warning of ""serious consequences"" if Russia ""decides to pursue confrontation."" Striking a conciliatory note, Blinken said the U.S. was ready to ""facilitate"" the ""full implementation"" of the Minsk peace accords. The Minsk deal was reached after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and aimed at resolving the conflict with pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine but never enforced. ""The best way to avert a crisis is through diplomacy,"" Blinken said. The U.S., Russia and Ukraine were all in Stockholm on Thursday for a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), one of the few international dialogue forums to which both the U.S. and Russia belong. Speaking in the plenary session, Blinken called on Moscow to ""de-escalate, reverse the recent troop build-up (and) return forces to normal peaceful positions."" Lavrov meanwhile warned that the ""nightmare scenario of a military confrontation was returning"" in Europe, accusing NATO of inching its military infrastructure closer to Russia's borders. He reiterated his opposition to any NATO expansion eastward — including Ukraine — but said Russia was open to dialogue. ""We are interested in joint efforts toward a resolution of the Ukraine crisis,"" he said. Despite the cordial tone, the OSCE meeting took place amid spiking tensions. At a NATO meeting in the Latvian capital Riga on Wednesday, Blinken accused Russia of trying to ""destabilize Ukraine from within as well as large scale military operations"". He said it was not known whether Russian President Vladimir Putin had decided to invade, but added: ""We do know that he's putting in place the capacity to do so on short order, should he so decide."" Blinken warned there would be ""far-reaching and long-lasting consequences"" for Moscow if it pushed ahead with any aggression, including ""a range of high-impact economic measures that we've refrained from using in the past."" Blinken also held talks on Thursday with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, who said his country would ""demonstrate restraint."" But he called on Kiev's partners to ""prepare a deterrence package"" that would make Russia think twice before resorting to military force. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had said on Wednesday that Crimea was Ukrainian territory and Kiev's goal was to ""liberate"" it. ""We see this as a direct threat to Russia,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday. Outside the diplomatic forum, tensions continued on the ground on Thursday. A Ukrainian soldier was killed in clashes with pro-Russian separatists, Kiev said, while Moscow announced it had arrested three Ukrainian spies, including one it said had been planning a terrorist attack. The OSCE meeting was planned long in advance but comes at a crucial moment as tensions mount on numerous issues in Europe. In addition to Ukraine, other issues on the meeting's agenda include the migrant crisis on the Belarus-EU border and the resurgence of clashes between OSCE members Armenia and Azerbaijan. The EU reached an agreement Wednesday on new sanctions against Belarus, and the US would follow suit soon, the U.S. State Department said. The OSCE ministers' plenary session is not expected to lead to the adoption of any major agreements, as unanimity is required.

According to the Levada Center, 39% of Russian respondents believe that war with Ukraine is either highly likely or unavoidable. Another 38% said that Russian-Ukrainian war is unlikely. Only 15% rule out the possibility of a Russian-Ukrainian war. Exactly half of those polled blamed the U.S. and other NATO countries for the current tensions in Ukraine. Older respondents were more likely to blame the West than their younger counterparts. The U.S. and its allies have in recent weeks said their intelligence and Russian troop movements near Ukrainian borders pointed to Moscow’s plans to invade Ukraine. Russia has denied planning an invasion, saying its military maneuvers come in response to Ukraine’s troop buildup. Moscow has also recently stepped up accusations of NATO’s eastward expansion and its deployment of weapons that threaten Moscow’s security. According to Levada, 16% of Russian respondents pinned the blame for heightened tensions on Ukraine. That figure saw little change when broken down into age groups. Only 4% blamed Russia and 3% the pro-Moscow breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine for the standoff. These figures also remained unchanged across all age groups. Younger Russians, however, were more likely to say that no one is to blame for the Russian-Ukrainian tensions or not answer the question than their older counterparts.

S ., Russian Foreign Ministers to Meet as Ukraine Tensions Soar",English,Russia,"Top U.S. diplomat Antony Blinken on Thursday warned Russia against invading Ukraine, as Moscow told Kiev that any attempt to retake the Crimean peninsula amounted to a ""direct threat"" to Russia. Western powers have been sounding the alarm in recent weeks about Russia massing troops along the border with Ukraine, further stoking tensions in an area where a long-running conflict has already left 13,000 dead. Moscow, which is accused of backing the separatists fighting Kiev, has denied preparing an attack and accuses NATO of raising the temperature. ""We have deep concerns about Russia's plans for renewed aggression against Ukraine,"" Blinken told Lavrov in talks on Thursday near Stockholm, warning of ""serious consequences"" if Russia ""decides to pursue confrontation."" Striking a conciliatory note, Blinken said the U.S. was ready to ""facilitate"" the ""full implementation"" of the Minsk peace accords. The Minsk deal was reached after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and aimed at resolving the conflict with pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine but never enforced. ""The best way to avert a crisis is through diplomacy,"" Blinken said. The U.S., Russia and Ukraine were all in Stockholm on Thursday for a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), one of the few international dialogue forums to which both the U.S. and Russia belong. Speaking in the plenary session, Blinken called on Moscow to ""de-escalate, reverse the recent troop build-up (and) return forces to normal peaceful positions."" Lavrov meanwhile warned that the ""nightmare scenario of a military confrontation was returning"" in Europe, accusing NATO of inching its military infrastructure closer to Russia's borders. He reiterated his opposition to any NATO expansion eastward — including Ukraine — but said Russia was open to dialogue. ""We are interested in joint efforts toward a resolution of the Ukraine crisis,"" he said. Despite the cordial tone, the OSCE meeting took place amid spiking tensions. At a NATO meeting in the Latvian capital Riga on Wednesday, Blinken accused Russia of trying to ""destabilize Ukraine from within as well as large scale military operations"". He said it was not known whether Russian President Vladimir Putin had decided to invade, but added: ""We do know that he's putting in place the capacity to do so on short order, should he so decide."" Blinken warned there would be ""far-reaching and long-lasting consequences"" for Moscow if it pushed ahead with any aggression, including ""a range of high-impact economic measures that we've refrained from using in the past."" Blinken also held talks on Thursday with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, who said his country would ""demonstrate restraint."" But he called on Kiev's partners to ""prepare a deterrence package"" that would make Russia think twice before resorting to military force. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had said on Wednesday that Crimea was Ukrainian territory and Kiev's goal was to ""liberate"" it. ""We see this as a direct threat to Russia,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday. Outside the diplomatic forum, tensions continued on the ground on Thursday. A Ukrainian soldier was killed in clashes with pro-Russian separatists, Kiev said, while Moscow announced it had arrested three Ukrainian spies, including one it said had been planning a terrorist attack. The OSCE meeting was planned long in advance but comes at a crucial moment as tensions mount on numerous issues in Europe. In addition to Ukraine, other issues on the meeting's agenda include the migrant crisis on the Belarus-EU border and the resurgence of clashes between OSCE members Armenia and Azerbaijan. The EU reached an agreement Wednesday on new sanctions against Belarus, and the US would follow suit soon, the U.S. State Department said. The OSCE ministers' plenary session is not expected to lead to the adoption of any major agreements, as unanimity is required.

To encourage Biden to accept this responsibility, Russia has been staging military drills close to Ukraine’s borders, with enough troops massing there to launch an offensive. As Putin seeks a final formula for the configuration of the post-Soviet space, the signal is clear: if the Minsk agreements aren’t being implemented, the alternative is military force. Back in October, Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said that in order to help resolve the conflict, the United States doesn’t necessarily have to be part of the Normandy format for talks (that format consists of Ukraine, Russia, France, and Germany). Another way of interpreting this is that Moscow doesn’t see the need for the Europeans to take part in any serious conversation on Ukraine, since it believes that any such conversation should take place directly between Moscow and Washington. This was also the thinking behind the Russian Foreign Ministry’s controversial publication of confidential correspondence on Ukraine between the ministry’s head, Sergey Lavrov, and his French and German colleagues: Moscow is showing that there is nothing to discuss with Ukraine’s advocates, and that talks should be held directly with its patron Washington. It also explains Lavrov’s complaints that Russia proposed including the United States in the Normandy format, but that Germany and France refused, as well as Putin’s calls for firm guarantees that NATO will not expand further east: something only the United States can promise. Although this may look like an unreasonable negotiating position now, it clearly sets out the strategic horizon of Russia’s demands. If those demands are satisfied, Russia is ready to promise predictability and security. In other words, the issue here is the Minsk agreements in their broadest interpretation: a chain of actions and obligations that should lead to a Ukraine that is friendly and neutral, but not necessarily subordinate to Moscow: something along the lines of Kazakhstan. By massing its troops at Ukraine’s borders, Russia is implying that Kiev’s failure to implement the Minsk agreements is a sign it wants to take back the Donbas by force. Ukraine’s Western allies don’t believe for one minute that Kiev would embark on such a reckless undertaking, and instead see it as a sign of impending Russian aggression. The Americans don’t want a war in Europe: it could lead to the defeat of their ally Ukraine, and the need to come back swinging at Russia. The impossibility of responding by force and the insufficiency of further sanctions would make America look weak for the second time in a year, following its withdrawal from Afghanistan. In these circumstances, it’s better to work on the Minsk accords — or other agreements. Judging by the Russian communique on the presidential meeting, as well as by the press conference given by Biden’s national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, the United States is indeed prepared to push for the implementation of the Minsk agreements. Still, Biden can’t just accept responsibility for implementing the agreements simply because the Kremlin is disappointed in Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the Europeans: that would mean he was carrying out Putin’s wishes, and he has promised not to give in to him. In this respect, the buildup of troops and talk of an imminent Russian attack on Ukraine are very timely. For having confirmed to Putin the U.S. commitment to taking part in resolving the Ukraine conflict, Biden needs something in exchange — like showing the world he has managed to stop Putin and prevent a war. That’s no mean feat, and a powerful defense against those who have criticized him for even sitting down with Putin. For this reason, among others, the idea of an impending war began to take on a life of its own even before the summit, and to have as much impact on the behavior of the parties involved as actual events. The source of this talk of a coming war is Western media, politicians, and experts: not the Kremlin, which prefers to use secret special operations to achieve its goals, rather than openly mobilize its troops, which is simply a way of strengthening its negotiating position. Biden has come out of this as the leader who prevented a war, but that’s not to say that the summit will necessarily be followed by deescalation and the return of Russian troops to their barracks, as was the case back in the spring after the agreement to hold the Geneva summit. This time, no dramatic deescalation is likely. Biden will be the leader who prevented a war, but not the threat of war: not until Moscow sees new steps taken by Washington on Ukraine and visible signs of work on engaging with Russian security concerns. The Minsk agreements themselves are not equally acceptable to Ukraine and the United States. Washington has said that the agreements are the most important and, effectively, the only way of resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The United States cannot, without losing face, give public assurances that Ukraine will not join NATO. Its intentions on this issue can only be divined from indirect signs over several months, or even years. For Moscow, progress on implementing the parts of the Minsk agreements that are most unpalatable to Kiev would show that its concerns are being taken seriously, rather than being ignored in the hope they will blow over. The problem is that Kiev is prepared to wait until any fresh insistence on the Minsk agreements being implemented blows over. Just as the West overestimates the absolute influence of Putin, Moscow is mistaken when it sees Ukraine as a mere U.S. satellite. The West may have some levers of influence over Kiev, but nothing can replace the conflict in the Donbas as a source of anti-Russian mobilization within Ukraine, and a way of attracting allies and constantly putting pressure on Moscow in international affairs. Russia would be satisfied with a neutral, friendly, bilingual Ukraine, but that would be seen as a humiliating step backwards by many in Ukraine. For this reason, the danger of renewed hostilities in eastern Ukraine is considerably less virtual than the presidential summit. Handing over responsibility for the Minsk agreements to the United States is Putin’s final attempt to resolve the issue of Ukraine before 2024 — when his current term ends — within the existing legal framework. If that doesn’t work, Putin, who is consolidating his political and historical legacy ahead of 2024, will look for other ways of resolving the Ukraine crisis. It appears that what he manages to achieve in Ukraine will be the deciding factor in whether or not Putin stays on after 2024. From his words and an article on the issue, it’s clear that Putin sees relations with Ukraine as part of his historical mission. That’s not something he wants to leave in less experienced hands, nor to share the credit for in the event of success. And in the event of failure? Well, if victory hasn’t yet been achieved, perhaps it’s not the time to step down.

Putin's comments came as U.S. President Joe Biden was scheduled to speak with Ukraine leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the heads of other countries on Russia's borders concerned over Kremlin military aggression. They came in response to a question during a meeting of the presidential rights council, during which Putin fielded a query on discrimination against Russian speakers beyond Russia's borders. ""I have to say that Russophobia is a first step towards genocide,"" the Russian leader said. ""You and I know what is happening in Donbass,"" referring to the conflict zone in the east of the country, adding that: ""It certainly looks like genocide."" Putin has previously made similar comparisons about the war in eastern Ukraine including in 2015 and 2019. Most people in Ukraine speak both Ukrainian and Russian, though regions in the south and east — and some in the center — are predominantly Russian-speaking and have traditionally been more Russia friendly. A popular uprising in Ukraine forced a Moscow-backed regime out of office in 2014. Since then Moscow has annexed Crimea and Kiev's forces are locked in conflict with separatists supported by Russia in the east of Ukraine. The fighting there has cost some 13,000 lives so far.

All three Ukrainian nationals had confessed to being recruited by Ukraine’s military and security services, Interfax quoted the FSB as saying. Ukraine's security service, the SBU, denied the incident, saying the accusation was ""fake"" and part of a ""hybrid war"" effort. The Russian intelligence service said one of those detained had planned to detonate two explosive devices at an undisclosed location. The FSB identified the alleged spy as Oleksandr Tsilyk, who had reportedly confessed to being recruited by the Ukrainian defense ministry's main intelligence directorate. “I was recruited in May 2021,” he was quoted as saying, adding that Ukrainian intelligence had trained him to “work with dead drops and special communications.” A father-and-son pair identified as Zinoviy and Ihor Koval also confessed to being ordered by the Security Service of Ukraine to “photograph road and railway bridges as well as a thermal plant” in exchange for a $10,000 reward, Interfax reported. The FSB’s anti-terrorist unit said it had uncovered “short-barrelled automatic weapons and personal protective equipment” in the pair’s vehicle that were sent for forensic review. The FSB did not disclose where in Russia or when the alleged spies had been detained. Its announcement of arrests comes amid growing warnings from Ukraine and its Western allies that Russia may be gearing up for an early 2022 invasion of Ukraine with a fresh troop buildup. Moscow has in return blamed Kiev for massing tens of thousands of troops near pro-Russia separatist-held territory in southeast Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy this week called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to explicitly deny plans to move Russian troops across the Ukrainian border, which Putin declined to do. Zelenskiy previously disclosed that Ukrainian intelligence services uncovered discussions between Ukrainian and Russian nationals of a Dec. 1-2 coup. The Kremlin denied any involvement.

",English,Russia,"Once again, the world is discussing the possibility of Russia waging war against Ukraine. This time, however, the circumstances are extraordinary. Back in the spring, the buildup of Russian troops for military drills close to Ukraine’s borders ended in a series of communications between the U.S. president and the leaders of Russia and Ukraine, followed by the summit this summer between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Joe Biden. At the time, that flare-up in tensions was explained as being down to the desire to put the Donbass conflict firmly on the agenda of the new U.S. president and to force new talks on the issue. Although the current escalation appears similar to that of the spring, a whole host of new circumstances has been thrown into the mix. The Russian Foreign Ministry has broken a diplomatic taboo by publishing confidential correspondence with Germany and France over Ukraine: something that would have needed to be approved at the very top. Speaking at the Foreign Ministry soon after this, Putin called for “serious, long-term guarantees that ensure Russia’s security in this area [its Western borders], because Russia cannot constantly be thinking about what could happen there tomorrow.” It’s not clear what form such guarantees would take, but it’s likely that ahead of another possible summit between Putin and Biden, Moscow would like to receive assurances similar to those made to Beijing: not to enter into an open conflict with China, and not to try to change the Chinese political system. Instead of such assurances, however, Russia has seen Western military vessels close to Russia’s borders, and a resolution introduced to the U.S. Congress that would automatically declare Putin’s rule illegitimate beyond the next elections in 2024. It seems that Russia does not have the same sway as China to obtain the promises that one superpower has given another. As a recent superpower, Russia considers this particularly unpleasant, and the simmering conflict in eastern Ukraine could be used to give it more clout. The West finds itself, therefore, facing the uncomfortable dilemma of whether to boost Russia’s status, thereby rewarding the dangerous exploitation of a simmering conflict, or to refuse to give Moscow the promises it desires, thus conserving the conflict in its heated state. Russia’s action of releasing the diplomatic correspondence and Putin’s call for guarantees can be interpreted in two ways. Either Moscow has information that Kiev is seriously considering a military solution to the problem of the Donbass separatists, or Russia itself is preparing for a military operation in eastern Ukraine, and these overwrought statements are an attempt to absolve itself of responsibility for its future actions: alas, Moscow had warned of the coming storm, and called for action, but to no avail. The problem is that if implemented, the first scenario of Ukraine taking back Donbass by force would instantly turn into the second: of Russia invading Ukraine. Western journalists and politicians would not have enough time to decide who started it, nor indeed the motivation, since Ukraine would be acting on territory internationally recognized as its own, unlike Russia, which would inevitably be designated the aggressor. Even if Russia were only responding to action taken by Ukraine, it would still be seen as invading: something the West has warned against. Determining how proportionate a response was to the use of force would be a long and difficult process. In Kiev, the tone of Moscow’s statements is seen as a sign that Russia itself is preparing to strike first, and is simply trying to push responsibility for resumed hostilities elsewhere. Russia vividly recalls Georgia’s attempt to regain control over South Ossetia in 2008, which was thwarted by Russia’s intervention. Despite the fact that Georgia’s proactive role in the events of the six-day war is now much clearer (thanks to Wikileaks and the Tagliavini report), that war is still broadly cited as an example of Russian aggression and occupation, since it unfolded on territory internationally accepted as part of Georgia, albeit at the location of a frozen conflict. Georgia’s then president Mikheil Saakashvili’s attack on South Ossetia is still considered to have been prompted by a deliberate provocation by separatists and Moscow. In a situation in which the two sides suspect each other of harboring the worst intentions, and with every hour counting at the start of military action, the South Ossetia scenario could unfold of its own accord. A confrontation on the Donbass demarcation line that goes beyond the regular clashes could prompt a response like that over Ossetia: why wait for the worst to happen? Nor would it be hard to manufacture such an event, should there be any desire to do so. If the West views any events in Donbass in the broader context of a Russian attack on Ukraine’s territorial integrity, and even the restoration of the Russian empire, many in Moscow see those same events as an attack by the Kiev authorities on the integrity of ethnic Russians. In his recent article on Ukrainian history, Putin wrote in startlingly harsh terms about the disappearance of hundreds of thousands of Russians, comparing it to the use of weapons of mass destruction. A man who holds such views is unlikely to simply step down from his post without even trying to stop such an adverse turn of events. What would his successors say? After all, Ukraine was offered the decent option of the Minsk agreements and voluntary federalization, while the West was offered Ukrainian neutrality. The options left are the bad ones. Russia, for its part, is discovering its own worst option. For three decades, the greatest fear of the Russian leadership was that Ukraine (and Belarus) would join NATO and move Western military infrastructure right up to Russia’s borders. Now it turns out that that can happen even without NATO, and in more real and long-term and less predictable ways. An aggrieved country that is building its entire identity on the rejection of everything Russian is far easier to turn into a fortified area on Russia’s border than a country confined by NATO procedures. In the absence of any security guarantees from a bloc, that country will be ready at the drop of a hat to welcome foreign aircraft, ships, and troops, and to equip its own army, leaping into action out of fear. Russia’s military preparations, the publication of the confidential correspondence, and Putin’s call for guarantees on its southwestern flank signal that Moscow has recognized the danger of coexisting with such a fortified area and does not want to accept it, but doesn’t yet know what to do about it. For now, Moscow and Kiev are opting to increase their own significance by showing how — with their restrained and responsible behaviour — they are saving humanity from the danger of a global conflict into which the opposite side would readily drag the world.

Fears that this time, the Kremlin’s actions will culminate in another war have prompted a hastily arranged video call on Ukraine between U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin, due to take place on Dec. 7. So far, all of the Western anxiety and hand-wringing about the crisis seems to be clouding people’s ability to listen to what the Kremlin is actually saying. Until now, there has been surprisingly little Western acknowledgement that Russian President Vladimir Putin is being much blunter about what he wants in Ukraine and the lengths to which he is prepared to go to obtain it. In just a few days, Putin has said that he wants a deal to prevent Ukraine from ever joining NATO. He also wants a Western promise never to deploy NATO military infrastructure in Ukraine. Putin cited U.S. MK-41 missile launchers now in Romania to illustrate what he’s worried about: “I will repeat once again that the issue concerns the possible deployment in the territory of Ukraine of strike systems with the flight time of 7–10 minutes to Moscow, or 5 minutes in the case of hypersonic systems. Just imagine that.” Why is Putin, who sometimes keeps his cards close to the vest, being so specific? Seen from Moscow, it appears that the Kremlin’s key objective in the current crisis is not to inflict a humiliating defeat on Kiev or to take on the unsavory job of occupying Ukraine. Rather it is aimed at persuading the West that Russia is prepared to start a full-scale war over Ukraine unless something is done about the existing and (in Putin’s eyes, at least) completely unacceptable state of affairs. Over the past year, the Kremlin has communicated two simple messages to Biden and his team. First, Russia attaches paramount importance to Ukraine. Second, its patience with the status quo is running thin, and it is ready to take drastic measures to reverse the situation. These messages come in a variety of forms, including harsh public statements, lengthy essays penned by members of the Russian leadership such as Putin himself, and even the publication of confidential correspondence between Moscow and France and Germany on the Donbas conflict. The last step was unprecedented and apparently intended to communicate Russia’s utmost irritation with the stalemate in the implementation of the Minsk agreements aimed at ending the conflict. Moscow’s main concern — preventing Ukraine from joining NATO — is hardly new news. What has changed is that the Kremlin now argues that even if Ukraine never formally accedes to the alliance, it must never be turned into a U.S. military bridgehead on Russia’s border. Other issues are also being identified as must-haves by the Kremlin. It wants to prevent the European Union from linking flows of Russian natural gas to Europe to the Ukrainian conflict. This issue has become more acute in recent months due to the debate over the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was designed to end once and for all the need for export infrastructure passing through Ukrainian territory. Cultural issues are particularly neuralgic. In his extensive article on Russia-Ukraine relations, Putin emphasized the historical affinity and unity of the two nations while harshly accusing the Ukrainian authorities of using coercive assimilation policies to diminish the number of Russians living in Ukraine “by millions.” The use of such strong wording was no coincidence: mass coercive assimilation may constitute a misdeed grave enough to warrant a foreign intervention to stop it. Ever convinced that a kind word and a gun are more efficient than a kind word alone, Russia has accompanied all of these forms of communication with military ones, transforming the security balance on the ground. By moving huge numbers of troops to the Ukrainian border, the Kremlin now has the ability to threaten the country from the south and north, as well as the east. Putin wants Biden to finally face up to an unpleasant dilemma. The message is simple: Washington needs to brace itself for its partner Ukraine to be soundly defeated militarily in what would be an especially humiliating re-run of recent events in Afghanistan. Or it can back down and reach a compromise with Moscow over Ukraine. The Kremlin seems to be under no illusions that the first option would inflict huge costs on Russia’s economy and international standing. But it wants to convince the United States that it is prepared to bear those costs because of the importance of Ukraine for Russian national interests. Putin is also seeking to persuade Washington that unlike Russia, it has little to lose from compromising over Ukraine. The country’s fate is hardly a U.S. vital interest worth going to war over, let alone an important element of the Biden administration’s foreign policy agenda. If Washington doesn’t need Ukraine as an ally in its standoff with China or to fight climate change, why sleepwalk into a possible confrontation with Russia over it? Just a few months ago, Biden showed that he believed U.S. interests in Afghanistan were not sufficient to justify an open-ended troop presence and that he was willing to scale back U.S. commitments in order to adapt his foreign policy to new global realities. In the Kremlin’s view, it is now time for the United States to make a similar rational choice about Ukraine.

Vows to Prevent Any Russian Invasion of Ukraine,English,Russia,"U.S. President Joe Biden said Friday he would make it ""very, very difficult"" for Russia to launch any invasion of Ukraine, which warned that a large-scale attack may be planned for next month. Washington and Kiev say Moscow has massed troops near Ukraine's borders and accuse Russia of planning an invasion. Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin are due to hold a video call in the near future to discuss the rising tensions, both sides confirmed Friday. Biden told reporters in Washington he was putting together ""the most comprehensive and meaningful set of initiatives to make it very, very difficult for Mr Putin to go ahead and do what people are worried he may do."" Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and has since been accused of backing separatists fighting Kiev in the east of the country. The conflict has left more than 13,000 dead. ""The most likely time to reach readiness for escalation will be the end of January,"" Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov told parliament in Kiev on Friday. A report in the Washington Post on Friday citing U.S. officials and an intelligence document said Russia was planning a multi-front offensive involving up to 175,000 troops as soon as next year. Reznikov said a ""winter training period"" had started in Russia and that Moscow had already launched exercises near Ukrainian territory. He estimated that Russia had around 100,000 troops near Ukraine's border. Russia denies any military build-up. On the frontline in eastern Ukraine, government troops said they were ready to repel any Russian assault. ""Our task is simple: not to let the enemy enter our country,"" a soldier named Andriy, 29, told AFP, smoking in a trench near the frontline town of Svitlodarsk. ""All our guys are ready to hold them back. This is our land, we will protect it until the end,"" another soldier, Yevgen, 24, added. Kremlin foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov told reporters a date had been agreed for the Putin-Biden video summit but would not be announced until final details of the talks have also been set. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the call was expected ""in the very near future."" Asked if he had spoken to Putin on Friday morning, Biden shouted ""no"" as he left a press conference in Washington. He gave no further details of his planned ""initiatives"" on Ukraine. Putin has warned the West and Kiev against crossing the Kremlin's ""red lines"" over staging military exercises and building up weaponry in Ukraine. When reporters asked Biden whether he would accept Putin's line, he responded, ""I won't accept anybody's red line."" Despite increased contacts between the two rivals since Putin and Biden met for the first time at a summit in Geneva in June, tensions remain high. As well as the Ukraine conflict, Russia and the United States continue to argue over cyberattacks and the staffing of their embassies, after several waves of diplomatic expulsions. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told AFP on Friday that it rejects any efforts to get it to scrap its plans to join NATO. Moscow wants to see an end to NATO's eastward expansion, after much of Eastern Europe joined the alliance following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Agreeing to abandon its plans to join the alliance ""is not an option,"" Kuleba said on the sidelines of an OSCE meeting in Stockholm. ""I reject this idea that we have to guarantee anything to Russia. I insist that it's Russia who has to guarantee that it will not continue its aggression against any country,"" he said.

Zelenskiy said Friday that Kiev is “entirely prepared” for a potential Russian invasion and added that Ukrainian security services had obtained audio recordings of discussions of a Dec. 1-2 coup. He did not accuse Russia of involvement, though he did say it involved Russian citizens. “Absolutely,” Reuters quoted Prime Minister Denys Shmygal as saying when asked if the Russian state was behind the alleged coup plot. “We have secret data which demonstrates the special intentions [to foment a coup],” Shmygal said on a visit to Brussels for talks with top EU officials. The Ukrainian prime minister added that intelligence had picked up activities of “outside powers” trying to influence Ukraine’s political opposition to whip up popular discontent and a government overthrow. “We understand there was influence from outside to enforce protests in Kiev, to make them stronger. Our secret service is making a special investigation,” Shmygal said. The Kremlin denied any involvement Friday. “We don’t engage in that,” Interfax quoted Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov as telling reporters. Zelenskiy on Friday called on Putin to specifically deny that Russia is “not planning” to invade Ukraine.

The short-notice call came amid high alarm from Washington over Russia’s massing of troops near the Ukrainian border, with reports saying U.S. intelligence has information on a possible Russian invasion as soon as late January. But although the Kremlin described the two-hour discussion as “frank and businesslike,” the path forward for both sides — and Ukraine — remains unclear. Here’s a recap of what the two leaders discussed: Western response if Russia invades Ukraine “President Biden voiced the deep concerns of the United States and our European allies about Russia's escalation of forces surrounding Ukraine,” the White House said in a statement. Biden “made clear that the U.S. and our allies would respond with strong economic and other measures in the event of military escalation.” The U.S. leader also “called for de-escalation and a return to diplomacy,” the statement said. Biden's national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, said there were sanctions that Washington had held back from in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine, but was ""prepared to do now."" According to Bloomberg, these would include fresh restrictions on the Russian ruble, Russian sovereign debt, and on some of the country’s largest financial institutions. Cutting off Russia from the SWIFT international payment system is also on the table if there is an invasion. Nord Stream 2 Following the call, U.S. officials made clear that if the Russian leader does take military action against Ukraine, freezing the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline and its money-earning potential would be a key mode of retaliation. The 10 billion-euro ($12 billion) pipeline, majority-owned by Russian giant Gazprom, was completed in September, just around the time the Russian buildup of some 100,000 troops near the border with Ukraine began. “It is leverage for the West, because if Vladimir Putin wants to see gas flow through that pipeline, he may not want to take the risk of invading Ukraine,” said White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. Putin’s ‘red lines’ The Kremlin said Putin blamed NATO for tensions in Ukraine and insisted on “legal guarantees” against the Western military alliance expanding its forces any closer to Russia. Putin says he sees Ukraine's growing alliance with Western nations as a threat to Russian security — and that any move by Ukraine to join NATO or to host NATO missiles would be unacceptable. “Russia is seriously interested in obtaining reliable legal guarantees that will exclude NATO's eastward expansion and the deployment of offensive strike weapons in countries adjacent to Russia,” the Kremlin said. Restoring diplomatic missions Biden and Putin discussed options for restoring both countries’ diplomatic missions, which have been left hamstrung by several rounds of tit-for-tat diplomat expulsions. The U.S. Embassy in Russia has been forced to suspend nearly all services. “The Russian side proposed to annul all the accumulated restrictions on the functioning of diplomatic missions, which could also serve to normalize other aspects of bilateral relations,” the Kremlin said. What else was discussed? Putin and Biden also discussed bilateral strategic stability plans set in place at their June summit in Geneva, efforts to fight ransomware and cybercrime and joint work on regional issues such as Iran. What wasn’t discussed? The pair did not discuss the poisoning and jailing of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, the banning of his groups as “extremist” or the controversial results of this year’s parliamentary elections. While Washington has criticized Russia over these issues, Moscow views such criticisms as interference in its domestic affairs. Washington’s accusations of Russian meddling in its presidential elections were also absent from the conversation. What are the results? Apart from agreeing to keep dialogue open in the interests of maintaining international security, Biden and Putin appear to have failed to make any significant breakthroughs. The White House did not say how Biden responded to Putin’s request for guarantees to halt NATO’s expansion or block Ukraine’s path to membership. Sullivan told reporters that Biden ""made no such commitments or concessions."" Biden is expected to speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Thursday. Asked if Russia planned to draw down troops after the summit, the Kremlin's top foreign policy adviser Yury Ushakov said: ""Russian troops are on their territory, they are threatening no one, the president has said so."" Ushakov insisted that a possible invasion of Ukraine by Russia had not been discussed.

""We would probably be required to reinforce our presence in NATO countries to reassure particularly those in the eastern flank. In addition to that, I made it clear that we would provide a defensive capability to the Ukrainians as well,"" he said. However, Biden said that sending US troops to defend Ukraine from Russia is ""not on the cards,"" because the country is not part of NATO. ""The idea the United States is going to unilaterally use force to confront Russia invading Ukraine is not on the cards right now,"" Biden said. ""We have a moral obligation and a legal obligation to our NATO allies under Article Five. It's a sacred obligation. That obligation does not extend to... Ukraine.""

The foreign ministry also demanded that NATO stop conducting military exercises close to Russia's borders and added that this and other security proposals would be unveiled ""in the near future."" Earlier this week Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. leader Joe Biden held two hours of talks, with the Kremlin chief demanding that the West put in writing guarantees that Ukraine would not become a NATO launchpad. In the past few weeks Russia moved around 100,000 troops to Ukraine's border. Putin did not say whether Moscow planned to go on the attack but insisted the country has a right to defend its security. On Friday, the Russian foreign ministry said the United States should formally close the door both to Ukraine and Georgia, which were promised in 2008 they would become members one day. ""In the fundamental interests of European security, it is necessary to officially disavow the decision of the 2008 NATO Bucharest summit that 'Ukraine and Georgia will become NATO members,'"" the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement. By supporting Ukraine and Georgia's aspirations, NATO is violating the basic principle of all OSCE participating states to ""not strengthen their security at the expense of the security"" of other states, Moscow said. The military bloc should also guarantee that weapons threatening Russia's security will not be deployed on the country's western borders — by either NATO members or other countries, the ministry said. Moscow also said it wanted to receive a ""concrete"" reaction from NATO regarding a number of earlier proposals, including a demand to move military exercises away from the ""contact line"" between NATO and Russian forces.

The behind-closed-doors talks came after weeks of rising tensions between Moscow and Washington, as a buildup of Russian troops on its border with Ukraine has sparked fears of a return to all-out hostilities between the two sides. But although the Kremlin described the two-hour discussion as ""frank and businesslike,"" the two leaders appear to have failed to reach a major compromise. Biden ""voiced the deep concerns"" of the U.S. and its European allies toward ""Russia’s escalation of forces surrounding Ukraine"" and vowed ""strong economic and other measures"" in response to a Russian offensive, the White House said in its readout of the call. ""President Biden reiterated his support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and called for de-escalation and a return to diplomacy,"" the White House added. In response, Putin accused NATO of ""making dangerous attempts to conquer Ukrainian territory"" and ""building up its military potential at our borders"" and reiterated his desire for legal guarantees that NATO will not expand any further eastward. The Kremlin said Putin described the current situation as a result of ""Ukraine's internal crisis"" and ""lack of progress"" in implementing the 2015 Minsk peace agreement. Putin also pointed to Ukraine's so-called ""destructive stance"" and its ""provocative actions"" against the eastern Donbass region, the Kremlin readout added. Apart from Ukraine, both the Kremlin and the White House said the two leaders discussed bilateral strategic stability plans set in place at their June summit in Geneva, efforts to fight ransomware and cybercrime and joint work on regional issues such as Iran. The Kremlin added that the two leaders discussed the problem of their countries' ""curtailed"" diplomatic missions following several rounds of tit-for-tat expulsions. ""The Russian side proposed to annul all the accumulated restrictions on the functioning of diplomatic missions, which could also serve to normalize other aspects of bilateral relations,"" the Kremlin said. Biden and Putin agreed that their representatives will maintain a dialogue on these issues, both sides' readouts said. The White House said Biden called the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Italy after the summit to follow up on coordinations between the leaders that took place Monday ahead of the Putin talks. He will also speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Thursday, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said.

The key question hanging over the talks — and the subject of keen debate among analysts and political leaders — is whether Putin might actually launch a cross-border offensive, or whether he is using the troops to pressure Biden for guarantees ex-Soviet Ukraine will never become a NATO launchpad. The two have a daunting list of other differences to air, from Russia's harsh treatment of dissidents to the presence of ransomware hackers on Russian soil to Moscow's support for the repressive regime in Syria. But the magnitude of the Russian buildup near Ukraine — the Kremlin may be planning an offensive early in 2022 involving up to 175,000 troops, according to U.S. intelligence obtained by The Washington Post and other outlets — has raised red flags in Washington and across Europe. Many analysts doubt that Putin would carry through with an invasion — which would inevitably prompt international condemnation and probably new sanctions — but at least some take a darker view. ""Putin has sharply raised the stakes. He is no longer bluffing,"" said Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of the political consultancy R.Politik Center and a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Moscow Center. ""He's ready to take a desperate step,"" she told AFP on Sunday. The looming crisis could pose the sternest test yet of the foreign policy savvy and clout of the 78-year-old U.S. president. Biden and Putin — who are expected to speak around midday Tuesday, Washington time — have a history together. They first met in person in the Kremlin in 2011. Then-vice president Biden later said he told the Russian leader, ""I don't think you have a soul"" (to which, Biden says, Putin responded, ""We understand one another."") They met again in 2014 in Geneva to deal with the now-familiar issue of Russian military pressure on Ukraine. And they met in Geneva on June 16 of this year — for the first time with Biden as president. Contacts have continued since — as have tensions, with Putin seen as eager to pressure Biden into another in-person summit as a way to project parity on the world stage. On Friday, Biden vowed to make it ""very, very difficult"" for Russia to launch an invasion but did not say how. Putin has warned the West and Kiev against crossing the Kremlin's ""red lines,"" including building up weaponry in Ukraine. Biden later responded, ""I won't accept anybody's red line."" Some analysts said Russia, deeply concerned with Ukraine's warming ties to NATO, is applying pressure to cut that movement short. Following Putin's lead, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday called on U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to provide ""security guarantees"" that NATO would not come closer to Russia's border. Stanovaya said this might be Putin's bottom line: ""Either NATO provides guarantees or Russia invades Ukraine,"" she said. Russia has continued to deny any bellicose intentions, instead accusing the West of provocations in the Black Sea. NATO recognized Kiev in June 2020 as one of a handful of so-called ""enhanced opportunity partners,"" potentially a step toward membership. Heather Conley, a former assistant U.S. secretary of state for European affairs, said she believes Putin is willing to apply ""enormous pressure"" in the Ukraine standoff. He is set on another in-person summit with Biden, said Conley, who is with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. And he wants to loosen Western ties to Ukraine which, she said, some see as ""a sort of NATO aircraft carrier."" Fyodor Lukyanov, a prominent political analyst close to the Kremlin, said he doubts Biden and Putin will agree on anything concrete on Tuesday, but he does not expect hostilities to break out if the talks fail. ""No, this is hysteria whipped up by the West,"" he told AFP on Sunday. ""Wars begin suddenly. If it begins, it will begin differently."" Moscow seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and has since backed the separatist forces fighting Kiev. The conflict has left more than 13,000 dead. What if the virtual meeting between the rival leaders goes poorly on Tuesday? If Russia fails to obtain the accommodations it seeks, and all efforts at diplomacy fail, said Conley, her sense is that ""Mr. Putin would then use military means to achieve his political objective.""",1,735,93.73,42.46,39.11,9.69,21.62,27.21,80.82,60.27,45.03,6.12,3.4,0.27,0.14,0.14,2.04,0.54,2.72,12.24,8.03,2.04,16.33,5.58,2.31,5.58,1.09,13.74,7.35,2.99,5.99,0.82,1.36,4.08,11.56,0.54,10.88,1.5,1.5,0.95,2.72,0.68,4.22,0,4.49,1.63,2.72,1.09,0,0.95,0.14,0.54,0,0,11.97,6.39,0.27,0.14,1.22,0.41,3.54,5.71,0,0,0.68,1.5,5.71,4.63,0.95,0.14,3.4,0,0,3.27,0,0.14,0.14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.14,0.68,0.14,0.82,0,0,0,0.27,0.68,0,2.59,11.02,0.27,1.9,7.48,1.09,0,0.41,4.22,4.08,3.95,2.45,0.27,0.14,0.14,0,0,18.5,5.85,5.31,0.14,0,1.5,5.71

U.S. intelligence and NATO allies believe Russia will be ready to conduct an invasion with 175,000 troops by the beginning of 2022. The magnitude of the Russian mobilization on the border makes it hard for the Kremlin this time round to walk back empty-handed. The virtual meeting between U.S. President Biden and Russian President Putin did not suggest a breakthrough in negotiations. The debates in and among the NATO and EU countries about how to respond to Russia’s saber-rattling have devolved into two antagonistic camps, which seems symptomatic of the Western polarization on most foreign-policy issues nowadays. Public debate is healthy when it balances a variety of concerns, but emotional polarization may fail to unite the Western countries around a calibrated policy. The first camp favors accommodating Moscow’s long-standing security concerns if that is what it takes to prevent war. The most debated proposal advocates Kiev to implement the Minsk Agreement concluded in 2015 to solve the conflict in the Donbass, even though this risks giving Russia a de facto veto over Ukraine’s foreign-policy decisions. Others argue that NATO and the United States should find a modus vivendi with Russia, starting with a willingness to bring into play NATO’s Open-Door policy, which today seems pointless to cling to since Ukraine anyway is unlikely to join the alliance. Their implicit assumption is that Russia acts defensively to prevent the the encroachment of rival alliance on its border. The second camp is vehemently opposed to giving in to Russian demands, some even accusing the former of appeasement or of taking a pro-Putin line. They claim pressuring Kiev to unilaterally implement the Minsk Agreement is both immoral and strategically ill-advised since it will invite more Russian aggression. Their explicit assumption is that Russia has broader expansionist ambitions that only superior force can tame – in the present crisis by threatening exclusion from the SWIFT banking system, sanctioning its debt markets, and ending Nord Stream II. While advocating increased military support of Ukraine, no serious policymaker has proposed combat-ready deployments to deter Russian aggression in Ukraine akin to what NATO membership would require. Either way, the premise of Western policy remains unwillingness to intervene militarily on behalf of Ukraine. It now falls on its diplomacy to test the nature of the Russian threat. Putin earlier this year published an essay essentially making the case that Russia and Ukraine make up one people, which was a pre-warning about the Kremlin’s dissatisfaction with status quo in Ukraine. Contrary to the claims of recent commentary, President Putin in the current escalation has been quite specific about his demands: a deal that prevents Ukraine from joining NATO, accompanied by a Western pledge not to deploy military infrastructure in the country. This is consistent with the findings of a recent Carnegie report asserting that Kremlin is as worried about ‘Ukraine in NATO’ as it is about ‘NATO in Ukraine’. In no circumstance could the Western countries agree to conceding Ukraine to a Russian sphere of influence. Pressuring Kiev to implement the Minsk Agreement may not be the best starting point, since that risks giving Russia a veto not only over Ukraine’s military orientation but also its economic and political affiliation with the EU. Instead, Western diplomacy should confine itself to Putin’s specific demands about NATO. It is a long-standing controversy for the Kremlin that gives reason to explore its significance for Ukraine-Russia and West-Russia stability. Considering the utility of the Open-Door policy is no longer as controversial as it was, say, 13 years ago when NATO agreed that Ukraine and Georgia ‘will become members’. Today, this is all but a distant aspiration for well-known both domestic and geopolitical reasons. Other than the general principle that all sovereign countries in Europe are free to choose their alliance affiliations, it is also unclear which NATO allies really wish to extend collective defense guarantees to Ukraine. The growing tension with Russia and the migrant grey-zone attack from Belarus seem to have changed the mood even in the Baltic States and Poland, whose security so crucially depends on the unambiguity of NATO’s collective defense guarantees. NATO could never agree to a ‘closed door’ policy but, if prompted by U.S. leadership, perhaps to negotiate about language that in exchange would commit Russia not to use military force against Ukraine and to solve the conflict in the Donbass. Such language should signal what is already the reality: that NATO has the intention neither to enlarge, nor to station military infrastructure in Ukraine in the current security environment. Negotiations should be treated strictly as a question of military neutrality, without concessions on NATO’s continued advising, training, and funding of Ukraine’s armed forces. It is necessary to factor in the two understandings of the Russian threat here. Should President Putin change his aggressive westward posture, concession on NATO may prove the right path for a more managed great-power rivalry with Russia (moreover, setting the United States on a firmer course to compete with China). Conversely, should Putin feel emboldened to threaten Ukraine and to further push Western lines, NATO has the option of backtracking its language. Rhetoric that does not hold the West back from more than what it might theoretical do seems to be its cheapest bargaining chip. Meanwhile, the Western debate tends to forget that Ukraine achieved what its Euromaidan Revolution in 2013-14 was essentially about: reaching an Association Agreement with the EU. While Ukraine’s exports to the EU and the rest of the world have grown, Ukraine still has not recovered economically to its pre-2014 level. This testifies to the significant domestic problems Ukraine must overcome to achieve prosperity. The more the West can convince Ukraine to define its destiny as one of fight against economic insecurity rather than of geopolitical choice and NATO membership, the more that process is likely to be surrounded by stability.",1,978,92.41,24.25,33.33,8.7,25.74,32.92,80.16,57.77,46.93,6.34,0.72,0,0,0,0.2,0.41,5.62,15.54,9,1.33,16.16,6.03,4.19,4.91,1.33,10.74,6.24,2.76,7.98,1.84,1.12,5.11,12.68,0.61,11.96,2.86,1.94,1.53,2.04,0.51,3.78,0.1,4.19,1.33,2.56,1.12,0,0.82,0.2,0.51,0,0,7.77,6.03,0.92,0,1.94,0.2,1.53,2.15,0,0,0,0.2,5.42,4.4,0.92,0.1,2.35,0.1,0,1.43,0.92,0,0.31,0.31,0.1,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0.41,0.2,0.2,0,0,0,0,1.43,0.1,2.86,7.87,0,0.61,6.95,0,0,0.31,3.27,1.53,4.19,1.33,0.2,0,0.2,0,0,12.37,4.5,3.48,0,0,1.53,2.86

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the conversation will take place in the evening Russia time and the two leaders will determine the duration, according to Russian news agencies. Biden said Friday he would make it ""very, very difficult"" for Russia to launch any invasion of Ukraine, which warned that a large-scale attack may be planned for next month. Washington and Kiev say Moscow has massed troops near Ukraine's borders and accuse Russia of planning an invasion. Russia has denied any bellicose intentions and accused the West of provocation, particularly with military exercises in the Black Sea, which it sees as part of its sphere of influence. Biden and Putin had been expected since Friday to hold a video call. Biden told reporters in Washington he was putting together ""the most comprehensive and meaningful set of initiatives to make it very, very difficult for Mr Putin to go ahead and do what people are worried he may do"". Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and has since been accused of backing separatists fighting Kiev in the east of the country. The conflict has killed more than 13,000. Moscow, meanwhile, wants to see an end to NATO's eastward expansion, after much of eastern Europe joined the alliance following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday called on his U.S. counterpart Antony Blinken to provide ""security guarantees"" that NATO would not come closer to Russia's borders. Despite increased contacts between the two rivals since Putin and Biden met for the first time at a summit in Geneva in June, tensions remain high.

But although the Kremlin described the two-hour discussion as ""frank and businesslike,"" the two leaders appear to have failed to reach a major compromise. Biden ""voiced the deep concerns"" of the U.S. and its European allies toward ""Russia’s escalation of forces surrounding Ukraine"" and vowed ""strong economic and other measures"" in response to a Russian offensive, the White House said in its readout of the call. ""President Biden reiterated his support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and called for de-escalation and a return to diplomacy,"" the White House added. In response, Putin accused NATO of ""making dangerous attempts to conquer Ukrainian territory"" and ""building up its military potential at our borders"" and reiterated his desire for legal guarantees that NATO will not expand any further eastward. The Kremlin said Putin described the current situation as a result of ""Ukraine's internal crisis"" and ""lack of progress"" in implementing the 2015 Minsk peace agreement. Putin also pointed to Ukraine's so-called ""destructive stance"" and its ""provocative actions"" against the eastern Donbass region, the Kremlin readout added. Apart from Ukraine, both the Kremlin and the White House said the two leaders discussed bilateral strategic stability plans set in place at their June summit in Geneva, efforts to fight ransomware and cybercrime and joint work on regional issues such as Iran. The Kremlin added that the two leaders discussed the problem of their countries' ""curtailed"" diplomatic missions following several rounds of tit-for-tat expulsions. ""The Russian side proposed to annul all the accumulated restrictions on the functioning of diplomatic missions, which could also serve to normalize other aspects of bilateral relations,"" the Kremlin said. Biden and Putin agreed that their representatives will maintain a dialogue on these issues, both sides' readouts said. The White House said Biden called the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Italy after the summit to follow up on coordinations between the leaders that took place Monday ahead of the Putin talks. He will also speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Thursday, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said. Байден выразил сожаление, что не смог увидеться лично с Путиным и заявил, что надеется на это в будущем. А в начале встречи - раскатисто рассмеялся. pic.twitter.com/Y7cRnfvguJ U.S. intelligence reportedly indicated that around 175,000 Russian soldiers have massed on the Ukrainian frontier, with a possible offensive as soon as late January. Russia has denied the accusations of military posturing as ""hysteria"" and maintains it is responding to a Ukrainian buildup and NATO provocations. ""Russia has never planned to attack anyone,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said ahead of Tuesday's talks. ""But we have our own red lines."" Mosow has made clear its desire for the U.S. to guarantee that Ukraine will not join NATO, and that deepening Kiev’s informal cooperation with the Western military alliance will be halted. Washington meanwhile has said that no country can block Ukraine's path to NATO membership. Kiev has been locked in a bitter war with pro-Russian separatists in its eastern Donbass region since 2014, the same year Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine. The conflict has claimed over 13,000 lives. Biden was expected to threaten sanctions that would go far beyond those introduced in response to the annexation of Crimea, as well as boosted military support in Eastern Europe, in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine. According to Bloomberg, the sanctions would include fresh restrictions on the Russian ruble, Russian sovereign debt, and on some of the country’s largest financial institutions. The New York Times has reported that cutting off Russia from the SWIFT international payment system is also under discussion if there is an invasion.

Deputy Foreign Ministry Sergei Ryabkov’s threat follows Moscow’s complaints over NATO weapons deployment in Eastern Europe and Western warnings of Russia’s imminent invasion of Ukraine. “Our response will be military” if the Western military bloc does not guarantee an end to its eastward expansion, Ryabkov told the state-run RIA Novosti news agency. “There will be confrontation,” he added, warning that Moscow would deploy weapons that were previously banned under the INF Treaty, which expired in 2019. “Currently, [these banned weapons] do not exist; we have a unilateral moratorium. We call on NATO and the United States to join this moratorium,” Ryabkov said, lamenting that “they just don’t respond to our proposals.” “There’s basically no trust in NATO,” the senior diplomat told RIA Novosti. “Therefore, we’re no longer playing this kind of game and don’t believe NATO’s assurances.” Elsewhere in Monday’s interview, Ryabkov derided the United States’ “inexplicable fixation” on the threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine. “This isn’t so and cannot be,” he said. Russian President Vladimir Putin held a videoconference with U.S. President Joe Biden last week, where he did not say whether he planned to go on the attack but insisted that Russia has a right to defend its security. Putin also demanded from Biden that the West guarantee in writing that Ukraine would not be a staging ground for NATO. On Friday, Russia’s Foreign Ministry demanded that the U.S. formally close the door to NATO membership to the ex-Soviet republics of Ukraine and Georgia. The Foreign Ministry also demanded that the Western military bloc guarantee the non-deployment of weapons threatening Russia’s security on its western borders.",1,290,68.11,44.13,31.84,4.28,20.71,34.48,80.69,54.14,44.14,10,3.45,0,1.72,0,1.38,0.34,6.55,14.48,7.59,0.34,11.03,7.24,4.14,4.14,3.45,12.76,4.14,1.03,9.31,2.76,0.34,6.21,9.31,0.69,8.62,1.38,1.03,1.03,1.03,1.38,3.45,0,3.45,0.69,2.76,0.69,0,0.69,0,0.34,0,0,15.17,9.31,0,0,2.41,0,5.86,5.86,0,0,0,1.38,8.62,7.93,0.69,0,2.07,0.69,0,1.38,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.41,0,2.76,10.69,1.03,0.34,9.31,0,0,0,3.45,4.14,3.45,2.07,0,0,0,0,0,24.14,6.21,4.83,0,0,4.83,8.28

The group itself, said by Western capitals to work on behalf of the Kremlin in conflict zones, was targeted with an asset freeze, along with eight individuals and three firms, diplomats said. The sanctions list was drawn up by EU officials and unanimously approved by foreign ministers, who met Monday to discuss various world crises and prepare Thursday's summit of European leaders. ""Wagner is a Russian private military company used to destabilize security in Europe and in its neighborhood, notably in Africa,"" one European diplomat said. Wagner is said to be financed by 60-year-old St. Petersburg businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, reputedly close to President Vladimir Putin, who has already been hit with EU and U.S. sanctions for destabilizing Libya and meddling in U.S. elections. Those sanctioned included: Dmitry Utkin, a 51-year-old former lieutenant colonel in Russian military intelligence — once decorated by Putin — now said to be Wagner's commander and responsible for mercenary operations in Ukraine. Utkin is accused of extrajudicial killings, including allegedly ordering a Syrian deserter to be tortured to death and filmed. Alexander Kuzentsov, a 44-year-old Russian said to be commander of Wagner's 1st Attack and Reconnaissance Company under the call sign ""Ratibor,"" accused of threatening the peace and security of Libya. Retired colonel Andrei Roshev, 68, a founding executive director of Wagner now commanding mercenary troops in Syria in support of Bashar al-Assad's regime under the call sign ""Siedoy."" Wagner units and operatives have been seen in several conflict zones, allegedly serving Russian private and state interests in Ukraine, Syria and Libya. The firm has also offered its services to local authorities in sub-Saharan Africa, including former French colonies Mali and the Central African Republic.

During their summit by secure video link Tuesday, Biden warned Putin of a ""strong"" Western economic response should Moscow attack its neighbor. The talks were seen as a chance to lower tensions on the Russian-Ukrainian border, where Moscow has deployed up to 100,000 troops, sparking fears of a major war. ""Russia has a peaceful foreign policy, but has the right to defend its security,"" Putin said at a news conference with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. He refused to say if Moscow planned to move troops massing on Ukraine's frontier across the border, but said that simply watching NATO move closer to Russia would amount to ""criminal inaction."" ""We cannot but be concerned about the prospect of Ukraine's possible admission to NATO, because this will undoubtedly be followed by the deployment of appropriate military contingents, bases and weapons that threaten us,"" he said. The Russian leader stressed that NATO expanding eastwards is a ""very sensitive"" issue for Russia. ""It is one of the key questions in preserving Russia's security,"" he said, adding that Russia had been ""warning"" NATO against any expansion. Putin told Biden on Tuesday that Moscow seeks legal guarantees from the West that Ukraine would not join NATO. The Russian leader nonetheless hailed the talks with Biden as ""constructive,"" saying the pair agreed to continue dialogue. France on Wednesday said it had sent ""strong messages"" to Russia warning that it would face ""strategic and massive consequences"" if it attacked Ukraine. The French foreign ministry statement came after telephone talks this week between the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, the UK and the U.S. It said that the so-called Quint of the five Western allies had in their talks ""expressed their determination that the sovereignty of Ukraine be respected."" The same day, Russia said sent planes to intercept and ""escort"" three French military plans flying near its borders in the Black Sea, in a rise of tensions. Moscow's defence ministry said its pilots escorted French Mirage-2000 and Rafale planes after stopping them from violating the Russian border. It is the latest sign of tensions in the Black Sea, a sensitive region for Russia which controls the Crimea peninsula after annexing it from Ukraine in 2014. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy — who has said he is ready to negotiate with Putin — said it was ""positive"" that Putin and Biden spoke. ""I think it's positive that the president of the United States spoke with the president of Russia,"" Zelenskiy said. He is due to hold talks with Biden on Thursday. ""I believe that Ukraine's victory lies in the fact that the United States has always supported Ukraine, our sovereignty and independence,"" Zelenskiy said at a press conference with Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic. He said it was ""important"" that Biden had taken a ""personal role in resolving the conflict"" in eastern Ukraine. Ex-Soviet Ukraine has been fighting pro-Russia separatists in its eastern Lugansk and Donetsk regions since 2014, shortly after Moscow seized Crimea. Kiev and its Western allies accuse the Kremlin of supporting the separatists — claims Moscow denies — in a conflict that has claimed over 13,000 lives.",1,545,90.97,56.48,20.49,5.27,24.77,27.89,80.55,58.17,42.57,9.72,3.12,0.37,0.55,0,1.28,0.73,6.61,14.86,8.44,1.65,13.94,5.69,1.28,4.22,0.37,13.94,6.06,1.83,7.52,1.65,0.92,5.14,7.71,0.18,7.52,1.47,1.28,0.92,1.28,0.55,2.57,0,4.95,1.47,3.3,0.55,0,0.37,0.37,0,0,0,15.41,9.91,0.73,0,1.65,0.37,6.42,5.5,0,0,0,1.28,6.42,4.59,1.65,0.18,1.65,0,0.18,1.28,0.18,0,0.55,0.18,0,0.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.18,0,0,0,0,1.65,0,1.1,10.09,0.92,1.1,6.61,0.73,0,0.92,3.67,6.61,4.04,1.1,0,0,0,0,0,18.53,4.77,4.77,0,0,1.28,7.71

The Russian and U.S. foreign ministers came face to face in Sweden to discuss recent allegations raised by Kiev and its Western allies that Russia could invade ex-Soviet Ukraine this winter. Western powers have been sounding the alarm for weeks about Russia massing troops along the border with Ukraine, further stoking tensions in an area where a long-running conflict has already left 13,000 dead. Moscow, which seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and backs separatists fighting Kiev, has strongly denied it is plotting an attack and blames NATO for fueling tensions. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday called for ""long-term security guarantees"" on his country's borders to halt NATO's eastward expansion after meeting U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. As Lavrov warned that the ""nightmare scenario of a military confrontation was returning"" in Europe Blinken said it was ""likely the presidents will speak directly in the near future."" Russia also said that it hopes for ""contact"" between Putin and Biden in the coming days. ""The date has not yet been agreed. There are difficulties in aligning the calendars of the two leaders, but contact is very necessary, our problems are multiplying,"" said Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov. ""There is no movement on bilateral affairs, which are more and more reaching an acute crisis phase. There is no mutual understanding about how to de-escalate the situation in Europe,"" he was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies. ""The situation in Europe is very alarming,"" he added. ""It's clear that this will be one of the main topics of discussion at the presidential level."" Attending a meeting in Stockholm of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Lavrov accused NATO of inching its military infrastructure closer to Russia's borders. Blinken said the U.S. had ""deep concerns about Russia's plans for renewed aggression against Ukraine,"" and warned Moscow of ""serious consequences"" if Russia ""decides to pursue confrontation."" But the top U.S. diplomat also struck a conciliatory note, saying the U.S. was ready to ""facilitate"" the ""full implementation"" of the Minsk peace accords. The Minsk deal was reached after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and aimed at resolving the conflict with pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine but never enforced. ""The best way to avert a crisis is through diplomacy,"" Blinken said. A senior U.S. official said Blinken had proposed a meeting of U.S. and Russian experts to draw up a road map aimed at ensuring that all parties respect the accords. The foreign ministers from Russia, Ukraine and the United States were all present in Stockholm for the gathering of the OSCE, one of the few international dialogue forums to which both Russia and the United States belong. Speaking in the plenary session, Blinken called on Moscow to ""de-escalate"" and pull back the troops the West claims have been massing at the Ukrainian border. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, who also met Blinken, said his country would ""demonstrate restraint."" But he called on Kiev's partners to ""prepare a deterrence package"" that would make Russia think twice before resorting to military force. At a NATO meeting in Riga on Wednesday, Blinken had accused Russia of trying to ""destabilise Ukraine from within as well as large scale military operations."" He said it was not known whether Putin had decided to invade, but added: ""We do know that he's putting in place the capacity to do so on short order, should he so decide."" Blinken warned there would be ""far-reaching and long-lasting consequences"" for Moscow if it pushed ahead with any aggression, including ""a range of high-impact economic measures that we've refrained from using in the past."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had said on Wednesday that Crimea was Ukrainian territory and Kiev's goal was to ""liberate"" it.

The British leader echoed concern from the G7 on Sunday about the build-up of Russian forces on the border, urging a diplomatic solution to the stand-off, his office said. His intervention comes after a two-day meeting of the G7 in which the grouping's top diplomats warned Moscow of ""massive consequences"" if it invades the former Soviet state. Direct contact between London and Moscow has been rare since London expelled dozens of Russian diplomats following a chemical weapon attack in the English city of Salisbury. Britain blamed Russia for the 2018 attempted murder of former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with the Cold War-era nerve agent Novichok. It had already accused the Kremlin of being behind the radiation poisoning death of another former Russian agent, Alexander Litvinenko, in London in 2016. Downing Street said Johnson told Putin of his ""deep concern"" at the Russian troop build-up on the border with Ukraine, which Moscow says is defensive. He ""reiterated the importance of working through diplomatic channels to deescalate tensions and identify durable solutions,"" the government statement said. ""The prime minister emphasized the U.K.'s commitment to Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty, and warned that any destabilizing action would be a strategic mistake that would have significant consequences.""

According to Bloomberg, the U.S. would increase its package of economic restrictions against Moscow, including further blocks on Russia’s sovereign debt and trading of the Russian ruble. Sanctions could also be slapped on some of the country’s top financial institutions, including state development bank the Russian Direct Investment Fund, effectively banning western financial institutions from dealing with them, Bloomberg said, citing unnamed U.S. sources. The New York Times reported that cutting off Russia’s access to the SWIFT international financial settlement system in the event of an invasion is also under discussion. The two presidents will speak later on Tuesday in an attempt to defuse a tense situation on the Russia-Ukraine border. Ukraine, the U.S. and its western allies have accused Russia of deploying up to 175,000 troops to the region and say they have evidence Moscow is planning an offensive. Russia has denied military posturing and says it is responding to a Ukrainian troop buildup.

""But if they choose not to pursue that path, there will be massive consequences and severe costs in response, and the G7 is absolutely united in that,"" a senior State Department official told reporters at a meeting of the grouping's top diplomats in Liverpool, northwest England, adding that Moscow still had time to change course.

The Russian and U.S. foreign ministers came face to face in Sweden to discuss recent allegations raised by Kiev and its Western allies that Russia could invade ex-Soviet Ukraine this winter. Western powers have been sounding the alarm for weeks about Russia massing troops along the border with Ukraine, further stoking tensions in an area where a long-running conflict has already left 13,000 dead. Moscow, which seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and backs separatists fighting Kiev, has strongly denied it is plotting an attack and blames NATO for fueling tensions. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday called for ""long-term security guarantees"" on his country's borders to halt NATO's eastward expansion after meeting U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. As Lavrov warned that the ""nightmare scenario of a military confrontation was returning"" in Europe Blinken said it was ""likely the presidents will speak directly in the near future."" Russia also said that it hopes for ""contact"" between Putin and Biden in the coming days. ""The date has not yet been agreed. There are difficulties in aligning the calendars of the two leaders, but contact is very necessary, our problems are multiplying,"" said Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov. ""There is no movement on bilateral affairs, which are more and more reaching an acute crisis phase. There is no mutual understanding about how to de-escalate the situation in Europe,"" he was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies. ""The situation in Europe is very alarming,"" he added. ""It's clear that this will be one of the main topics of discussion at the presidential level."" Attending a meeting in Stockholm of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Lavrov accused NATO of inching its military infrastructure closer to Russia's borders. Blinken said the U.S. had ""deep concerns about Russia's plans for renewed aggression against Ukraine,"" and warned Moscow of ""serious consequences"" if Russia ""decides to pursue confrontation."" But the top U.S. diplomat also struck a conciliatory note, saying the U.S. was ready to ""facilitate"" the ""full implementation"" of the Minsk peace accords. The Minsk deal was reached after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and aimed at resolving the conflict with pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine but never enforced. ""The best way to avert a crisis is through diplomacy,"" Blinken said. A senior U.S. official said Blinken had proposed a meeting of U.S. and Russian experts to draw up a road map aimed at ensuring that all parties respect the accords. The foreign ministers from Russia, Ukraine and the United States were all present in Stockholm for the gathering of the OSCE, one of the few international dialogue forums to which both Russia and the United States belong. Speaking in the plenary session, Blinken called on Moscow to ""de-escalate"" and pull back the troops the West claims have been massing at the Ukrainian border. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, who also met Blinken, said his country would ""demonstrate restraint."" But he called on Kiev's partners to ""prepare a deterrence package"" that would make Russia think twice before resorting to military force. At a NATO meeting in Riga on Wednesday, Blinken had accused Russia of trying to ""destabilise Ukraine from within as well as large scale military operations."" He said it was not known whether Putin had decided to invade, but added: ""We do know that he's putting in place the capacity to do so on short order, should he so decide."" Blinken warned there would be ""far-reaching and long-lasting consequences"" for Moscow if it pushed ahead with any aggression, including ""a range of high-impact economic measures that we've refrained from using in the past."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had said on Wednesday that Crimea was Ukrainian territory and Kiev's goal was to ""liberate"" it.

The US and its allies have for weeks accused Russia of planning an invasion of its neighbour, warning of a massive coordinated sanctions response should Putin launch an attack. Tens of thousands of Russian troops are stationed near the borders of ex-Soviet Ukraine, where the West has accused the Kremlin of backing pro-Moscow separatists since 2014. In a phone call with the Finnish president — whose country has traditionally served as middle ground between Russia and the West — Putin said he wanted security talks to begin without delay. He told President Sauli Niinsto that Moscow wants ""to immediately launch negotiations with the United States and NATO in order to develop international legal guarantees for the security of our country,"" the Kremlin said in a statement. Russia's demands, it said, included stopping NATO from expanding east and the deployment of weapons in neighboring states, including Ukraine. Putin reiterated the same demands in a phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron later on Tuesday. In his call with the Finnish president, Putin also accused the Ukrainian leadership of increasingly using ""heavy weapons and attack drones"" against pro-Russia rebels in its separatist east. The Russian leader denies planning an invasion, blaming the Western security alliance for the rise in tensions and demanding ""legal guarantees"" the alliance won't expand eastwards. U.S. President Joe Biden last week warned Putin of ""sanctions like he's never seen"" should Russian troops massed on the Ukrainian border launch an attack. The EU and the G7 met in recent days to coordinate what they warn would be an unprecedented economic sanctions regime if Russia attacks. Putin's comments come a day after Russia's deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov warned Moscow could act militarily if the talks it demands do not materialize. ""The lack of progress towards a political-diplomatic solution to this problem will lead to the fact that we will respond militarily,"" Ryabkov told the RIA Novosti state news agency. Tensions continued to soar Tuesday, with Russia saying it was monitoring a French warship near its borders in the Black Sea. The Russian army last week said it scrambled three of its jets to escort five French and U.S. military aircraft over the sea. Putin has accused the West of provoking tensions in the Black Sea, decrying U.S.-led military exercises there. The Black Sea is a sensitive region for Russia, which controls the Crimean peninsula after annexing it from Ukraine in 2014. Kiev has been fighting a pro-Russia insurgency in its eastern regions since the annexation. The conflict has claimed more than 13,000 lives. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, meanwhile, accused Kiev's ally Germany of blocking a supply of NATO weapons to the country. ""Germany has recently prevented us from getting anti-drone rifles and anti-sniper systems from NATO, which are exclusively defense tools,"" Zelenskiy said in an interview with Italian newspaper La Repubblica published Tuesday. ""Don't we have the right to have them in the eighth year of the war? Obviously, we do,"" he added. A spokesperson for the German foreign ministry said Monday that it could not comment ""on the confidential decisions at the heart of the (NATO) alliance at this stage."" Zelenskiy's comments come after Ukraine said in November it was seeking more military aid from its Western allies to deter Russia from an attack. The Ukraine leader warned of ""much higher losses"" in the event of an invasion. ""Is Russian society ready to pay with the lives of its sons for the attempt to occupy another part of Ukraine?"" he asked. The West for a long time hesitated to sell arms to Kiev, but Ukraine eventually managed to get some defense systems — including Turkish-made Bayraktar drones. Kiev's use of the drones in October was met with criticism from Russia and some of its Western allies, including France and Germany.",1,660,97.7,63.38,36.45,1.23,22,30.76,81.67,55.45,43.18,6.21,2.27,0,0.76,0,1.06,0.3,3.94,14.55,10.45,1.21,16.36,4.55,1.67,3.79,0.76,10.91,5,3.33,10,2.42,0.76,6.97,7.42,0.15,7.12,0.76,1.52,1.36,0.45,0.61,2.42,0,3.94,0.3,3.64,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.85,9.24,1.52,0,1.97,0.91,4.85,6.36,0.15,0.15,0,1.21,7.73,5.45,1.97,0.3,1.97,0,0.3,1.21,0.45,0,0.61,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.45,0.3,0.15,0,0,0,1.67,0,2.73,12.73,0.91,1.06,9.55,0.61,0,0.91,4.85,4.09,3.03,1.52,0,0,0,0,0,15.3,5.15,3.33,0.3,0,1.52,5

Russia has been accused of preparing to invade Ukraine and is amassing tens of thousands of troops close to the Ukrainian border, according to satellite images and Western intelligence reports. Moscow says it is not planning to attack and is responding to Ukrainian military posturing. Just 12% of Ukrainians said they see Russia as an ally, according to the survey by Ukrainian polling organization Rating Group published Friday. Despite this week’s call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his U.S. counterpart Joe Biden, fears remain high and the rhetoric about a possible confrontation has ramped up. In stark comments issued Thursday, Putin said the ongoing conflict between pro-Russia separatists and forces loyal to Kiev in eastern Ukraine “looks a lot like genocide.” Rating Group conducted its survey between Dec. 6-8 —  as Putin held his high-profile video call with Biden — and had 2,500 respondents from Ukraine, excluding Russia-annexed Crimea as well as the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk republics, which have been under separatist control since 2014. In April, when Russia was similarly accused of mounting a significant troop buildup near the Ukrainian border, 76% of Ukrainians said Russia was “hostile.” Some 14,000 people have died in the seven-year conflict between Ukraine and pro-Russian forces. Despite a ceasefire agreement, violations are rife and dozens of fighters from both sides are killed every year. A majority of Ukrainians want that agreement — named the Minsk accords — to be revised, the survey found. The survey also showed Ukrainians have grown significantly more negative toward Belarus over the past eight months as strongman leader Alexander Lukashenko has aligned himself more closely with Moscow amid international isolation. Almost half — 48% — of the respondents said Belarus was a “hostile state,” up from 22% in the previous survey.",1,312,96.3,47.66,35.18,1,22.29,32.37,75.64,54.49,43.27,2.88,1.28,0,0,0,0.96,0.32,1.6,12.82,7.37,4.49,17.31,6.09,2.56,5.77,0.32,11.22,6.09,5.13,5.77,1.28,0.32,4.17,6.41,0.32,6.09,0.64,1.6,0.32,0.64,0,2.56,0,6.09,1.28,4.81,1.6,0,1.6,0.32,1.28,0,0,11.22,7.37,0.64,0,3.85,0.96,2.88,4.17,0,0.32,0,0.96,3.21,1.28,1.92,0,1.6,0,0,1.6,0,0,0.96,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.96,0,0.32,0.32,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.53,11.86,0,0,10.26,1.28,0,0.32,3.85,6.41,3.85,0.64,0,0,0,0,0,16.03,5.13,4.49,0,0,0.32,6.09

Judges in Berlin sentenced Russian Vadim Krasikov, alias Vadim Sokolov, to life in jail after finding him guilty of gunning down Georgian national Tornike Kavtarashvili, 40, in a Berlin park in broad daylight on Aug. 23, 2019. ""Russian state authorities ordered the accused to liquidate the victim,"" presiding judge Olaf Arnoldi said, agreeing with prosecutors that the murder had been carefully planned. The murder was meant ""as retaliation"" for being a Kremlin opponent, the judge added. Moscow immediately slammed what it called a ""political"" ruling against a backdrop of ""general anti-Russian sentiment."" ""We consider this verdict to be a biased, politically-motivated decision that seriously aggravates already difficult Russian-German relations,"" Russia's ambassador to Germany, Sergei Nechayev, said in a statement. The ruling is the first major stress test for Germany's new government, which has vowed a tougher stance towards Russia, and comes amid growing alarm in the West about Russian troop movements on the border with Ukraine. New Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said she had summoned Moscow's ambassador to inform him that Germany was expelling two Russian diplomats in response to the court's ruling. ""This murder by order of the state as determined by the court today constitutes a serious violation of German law and sovereignty,"" Baerbock told reporters. Shortly after the murder in Berlin's Kleiner Tiergarten Park, Germany under then-chancellor Angela Merkel expelled two Russian diplomats in protest at Moscow's perceived lack of cooperation with the investigation. Russia, denying any connection to the killing, responded with a tit-for-tat move. According to German prosecutors, the suspect shot Kavtarashvili from behind on a bicycle, firing two shots from a Glock 26 pistol equipped with a silencer. After the victim fell to the ground, Krasikov is accused of then shooting him in the head, killing him on the spot, before getting back on his bicycle and fleeing. Police divers later recovered the handgun, a wig and a bicycle from the nearby Spree river. Calling for Krasikov to be jailed for life as they summed up their case last week, prosecutors said they had identified him as a ""commander of a special unit of Russian secret services FSB."" ""He liquidated a political opponent,"" prosecutor Lars Malkies told the court. But in an earlier hearing, the defendant had told the court through his lawyer Robert Unger that he should be identified only as Vadim Sokolov, who is ""Russian, single and a construction engineer."" He denied being known as Krasikov, saying ""I know of no one by this name."" Prosecutors say the defendant traveled as a tourist in the days before the murder, arriving on Aug. 17 in Paris where he visited sights before traveling to Warsaw. Photos of his tourist cover were found on a mobile phone in the Polish hotel where he stayed before heading to Berlin on Aug. 22. The trial has spanned a period of particularly rocky ties between Berlin and Moscow over a series of espionage cases, as well as the poisoning and jailing of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. Russia denies all allegations. The verdict also comes as Russia stands accused by the West of planning an invasion of Ukraine and massing tens of thousands of troops near its neighbor's border. Germany's new government has taken a sharp tone with Moscow, warning that it will not approve the controversial Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia in the event of any new ""escalation"" in Ukraine. Chancellor Olaf Scholz issued a fresh warning on Wednesday, saying Russia would pay ""a high price"" if it invaded its neighbor. Russian President Vladimir Putin has described the Tiergarten victim as a ""fighter, very cruel and bloody"" who had joined separatists against Russian forces in the Caucasus and also been involved in bombing attacks on the Moscow metro. Moscow also said it had been seeking his extradition. According to German media, the victim survived two assassination attempts in Georgia before seeking asylum in Germany, where he had been living for several years.",1,690,97.77,68.03,27.24,1,22.26,30,75.8,54.93,43.62,5.8,3.33,0.14,0.14,0,2.32,0.43,2.46,14.49,10.29,2.32,17.39,4.2,2.17,5.22,0.29,10.58,4.49,2.46,8.41,1.01,0.29,7.1,5.36,0.43,4.93,2.32,0.43,0.43,0.43,0.14,1.16,0,6.67,1.3,5.22,0.72,0,0.58,0.14,0.29,0,0.14,13.48,6.52,0.14,0.14,2.46,1.01,3.04,6.38,0,0,0.14,2.32,5.36,2.75,2.17,0.43,2.17,0,0.29,1.59,0.29,0,1.88,0.29,0.14,0,0,0,0,0,1.3,0,0,0.29,0.14,0,0,0,0.43,0,1.3,10.29,0.72,1.88,7.97,0,0.14,0,4.06,5.8,1.45,0.58,0,0,0,0,0,15.8,4.49,5.51,0,0,1.16,4.64

Here are the main highlights from his acceptance speech: — “There is a saying in Russian and English and other languages: ‘When the dogs bark, but the caravan keeps walking.’ One explanation is that nothing can hinder the progress of a caravan. The government sometimes derisively says the same about journalists. They bark, but it does not affect anything. But I was recently told that the saying has an opposite explanation. The caravan drives forward because the dogs bark. They growl and savage the predators in the mountains and the desert. The caravan can move forward only with the dogs around. Yes, we growl and bite. Yes, we have sharp teeth and a strong grip. But we are the prerequisite for progress. We are the antidote against tyranny.” — “​​There are two contradicting trends in Russia today. On the one hand, Russia’s president supports the erection of a monument to Sakharov’s 100th anniversary. On the other hand, Russia’s Prosecutor General demands the elimination of the international organization Memorial. ... But Memorial was established by Sakharov. Memorial is not an ‘enemy of the people.’ Memorial is a friend of the people.” — “We hear more and more often about torture of convicts and detainees. … I am now presenting an initiative of setting up an international tribunal against torture, which will have the task to gather information on torture in different parts of the world and different countries, and to identify the executioners and the authorities involved in such crimes. Of course, I shall rely first and foremost on investigative journalists around the world. Torture must be recognized as the most serious crime against humanity.” — “Hybrid warfare and the tragic, ugly and criminal story of the Boeing MH17 have ruined relations between Russia and Ukraine, and I do not know if the next generations will be able to restore them … Moreover, in the heads of some crazy geopoliticians, a war between Russia and Ukraine is not something impossible any longer. But I know that wars end with identifying soldiers and exchanging prisoners.” — “Journalism in Russia is going through a dark valley. Over a hundred journalists, media outlets, human rights defenders and NGOs have recently been branded as ‘foreign agents.’ In Russia, this means ‘enemies of the people.’ Many of our colleagues have lost their jobs. Some have to leave the country.” — “I can probably — as always — get questions like: why did your colleagues go there? Yes, to witness. To prove. To see it with their own eyes. Because as the great war photographer Robert Capa said: ‘If your picture isn’t good enough, you aren’t close enough.’ — “‘Aren’t you afraid?’ is the most common question my colleagues get. But this is their mission. As governments continually improve the past, journalists try to improve the future.” — “Let us rise and honor my and Maria Ressa's reporter colleagues, who have given their lives for this profession, with a minute of silence, and let us give our support to those who suffer persecution. I want journalists to die old.”",1,576,80.15,47.26,49.53,3.61,13.09,26.91,86.63,64.06,51.74,9.03,6.6,1.56,1.56,0.69,0.69,1.56,2.43,17.19,9.72,1.22,12.85,6.94,3.13,7.47,1.39,13.54,6.94,2.95,7.99,2.6,1.91,3.47,11.98,1.22,10.76,2.43,0.69,1.22,1.74,0.87,5.03,0,7.29,2.43,4.69,1.56,0.17,1.22,0.17,0,0.17,0,12.85,5.73,0.35,0,1.91,1.22,1.56,6.94,0,0,0,0.69,1.56,1.39,0.17,0,4.69,0,0.17,4.51,0,0,2.43,0,0,0,0,0,0.17,0,1.22,0.35,0.17,1.04,0,0.52,0,0.35,0.35,0,4.86,9.38,0,1.22,6.42,1.04,0.69,0.17,3.3,2.43,5.21,1.22,0.52,0,0.52,0,0,19.97,8.16,4.51,0.35,0,2.26,4.69

Now that thaw is definitively over. The political crisis that broke out following the contested presidential election of 2020, the European ban on EU aircraft flying over Belarus following the forced landing of a Ryanair plane in May, and Lukashenko’s pro-Russian lurch mean Minsk is no longer an acceptable stage for negotiations. The achievements of five years of an actively multi-vectoral foreign policy by Minsk from 2014 to 2019 have lost value. The bonuses that Belarus earned by distancing itself from Russia have vanished and will not return any time soon, given the extent of the West’s dismay over human rights abuses in Belarus. And if Minsk had continued to pretend to be neutral in the current situation, it would have risked eliciting the ire of Moscow too. Today, Lukashenko is dependent on the Kremlin’s goodwill and deep pockets for two key issues: how peaceful and smooth the rest of his time in power will be, and the future power transition. Minsk’s priority, therefore, is to win Moscow’s benevolence while giving up as little sovereignty as possible in exchange. Lukashenko has decided to go about this using two methods: making strong symbolic gestures on the one hand, such as recognizing Crimea as part of Russia, and dragging Russia even further into its geopolitical standoff with the West on the other. After all, Moscow will be far more willing to open its coffers for a proud bastion standing in the way of Moscow’s enemies than for an ally that is constantly performing a balancing act and which simply wants to live well without bothering to reform its economy. For Lukashenko, therefore, it’s important that his own standoff with the West should be perceived in Moscow not simply as the petty squabbles of a minor Eastern European state, but as part of a major NATO crusade against Russia and its friends. This is why Lukashenko has started resorting to the verbal rattling of Russian sabers, trying to involve Moscow in his own disputes with Belarus’s neighbors amid a series of belligerent, anti-Western statements, such as raising the possibility of returning Russian nuclear weapons to Belarusian territory, twenty-five years after they were removed. There are two possible explanations as to why Lukashenko has spoken out now on Crimea and launched his latest crusade against the West. The first explanation is that negotiations are under way on a new $3 billion loan for Minsk from the Eurasian Development Bank, which is controlled by Moscow. The second is that in a recent speech to senior Foreign Ministry officials, Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly said that Moscow is in favor of a dialogue between the authorities and the opposition in Belarus. Like many analysts, the Belarusian authorities likely interpreted Putin’s advice as a sign of displeasure, which could have been incurred by Minsk’s attempts to turn the drawn-out process of constitutional reform promised to Moscow into a mechanism for extending Lukashenko’s rule under a new title. In any case, it’s not a good idea to upset Russia over anything right now, while loans are being discussed and the West is introducing new sanctions against Belarus, which will require joint efforts by Minsk and Moscow to circumvent. Belarus’s neighbors — Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine — have long viewed the Belarusian authorities as a puppet regime controlled by Russia. Accordingly, the reaction to Lukashenko’s comments on Crimea was fairly muted. The EU and United States paid no heed, occupied instead with passing new sanctions against Minsk for instigating the migrant crisis on Belarus’s borders. There will be consequences for the relationship between Belarus and Ukraine, of course, but a complete breaking off of relations is unlikely. Most probably, Kiev will scale down its representation in Minsk by sending home the Belarusian ambassador and recalling its own. If Lukashenko visits Crimea in violation of Ukrainian law, as he has promised to, new personal sanctions are a possibility, along with trade wars, but Kiev is not prepared to go without its main Belarusian import: petrochemicals. Belarusian refineries send about 40 percent of their petrochemicals (gasoline, diesel, and bitumen) to neighboring Ukraine, which has no potential replacement for them in the foreseeable future. Nor is it likely that the West will impose additional sanctions specifically over Belarus’s recognition of Crimea. Restrictions are imposed over threats to regional stability, such as the forced landing of the Ryanair plane or the situation with the migrants on the Belarusian-Polish border. Against this backdrop, Lukashenko’s rhetoric about Russian territorial disputes with its neighbors pales in comparison. Given that Lukashenko had nothing left to lose in relations with the West and Ukraine, his recognition of Crimea is unlikely to herald a breakthrough in relations with the Kremlin. Support for Russia’s position on Crimea would have been appreciated back when it would have incurred a cost for Minsk. But a friendly gesture made out of despair, when Belarus’s multi-vectoral foreign policy has stopped yielding fruit, smacks of insincerity. In any case, the recognition of Crimea as Russian territory could easily be reversed by a future government eager to distance itself from the previous regime, whose very legitimacy is in doubt. For Moscow, of course, any crisis in the relationship between Minsk and Kiev is a bonus. It reduces the chance of any kind of coordinated action by these two neighbors — both transit countries for Russian gas supplies to Europe — in the future, as well as leaving Minsk with less room to maneuver and decreasing its chances of returning to any kind of multi-vectoral foreign policy. Only time will tell whether this move by Minsk will impact on Moscow’s financial generosity. The Belarusian state is due to pay off $3.4 billion in debts next year, and more than $4 billion in 2023. Taking into account the effect of Western sanctions and the state of Minsk’s foreign currency reserves, new Russian loans are absolutely essential. In September, Putin promised $630 million by the end of 2022. Clearly that won’t be enough, so Lukashenko’s Crimea diplomacy and, more importantly, the Kremlin’s reluctance to drive its ally to default and chaos mean Minsk can likely count on a larger sum. The problem is that Lukashenko will have to provide Moscow with constant reminders of his loyalty, and following his recognition of Crimea, he is running out of options for further rhetorical and symbolic concessions. Going forward, he will either have to sacrifice something sacred like state property or aspects of sovereignty, or escalate affairs with Belarus’s neighbors to such an extent that the Kremlin won’t be able to remain on the sidelines. For now, it looks like Lukashenko is leaning toward the second option, making that the biggest source of risk to the region today.

""The hysteria unrolled in the West on this topic shows, first of all, the jealousy of some European cities and states towards Africa and the Middle East, whose sovereignty and independence they were once forced to recognise,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. It added that Moscow may respond to the ""unfriendly"" move. On Monday, European foreign ministers agreed to slap sanctions on targets linked to Wagner — a secretive company accused of acting to destabilise Ukraine and parts of Africa. They approved a list of eight names and three companies associated with Wagner to be added immediately to existing sanctions regimes. The West says the group works on behalf of the Kremlin in conflict zones. In its statement, the ministry said ""private military companies are not under the control of official Russian authorities."" It added that independent countries — ""assessing their own security capabilities"" — have the right to work with such companies. ""The European Union casts doubt on the sovereign right of these UN member states to build an independent and domestic foreign policy,"" the ministry said. ""Russia reserves the right to respond to the unfriendly actions of the EU,"" it added. Wagner is said to be financed by Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, who has already been hit with EU and U.S. sanctions for destabilising Libya and meddling in US elections. In addition to the Wagner firm and three linked companies, the sanctions list targeted eight individuals, including the group's alleged commander.

",English,Russia,"Did anyone really think a two-hour video conversation between Presidents Putin and Biden was really going to bring a breakthrough? Of course, it didn’t. Nonetheless, it is worth considering just what such a personal connection can and can’t do. Of course, all we know about the conversation, beyond the first few seconds, is from the respective sides’ statements, so it’s simply a question of whose spin you want to believe. Washington’s brief readout struck a minatory tone, saying that Biden “reiterated his support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and called for de-escalation and a return to diplomacy,” and warning that “the U.S. and our Allies would respond with strong economic and other measures in the event of military escalation.” While Putin said the conversation was “very open, substantive, and constructive,” Moscow’s own rather lengthier summary offered — unsurprisingly — a rather different interpretation. It said that while “Biden, in turn, focused on what he described as “threatening” movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border… Putin warned against shifting the responsibility on Russia, since it was NATO that was undertaking dangerous attempts to gain a foothold on Ukrainian territory, and building up its military capabilities along the Russian border.” In particular, it emphasized Moscow’s new big-picture demand: that this crisis be resolved not simply with Kiev’s return to the Minsk process in the ways understood by Russia, but also with steps towards the creation of a new European security architecture, starting with “reliable, legally binding guarantees ruling out the eventuality of NATO’s eastward expansion and the deployment of offensive weapons systems in the countries neighboring Russia.” To some hawks in the West, President Biden’s willingness even to talk to his Russian counterpart was a concession. This is a deeply dangerous contention, as dialogue and diplomacy are precisely at their most valuable with those with whom one disagrees and in times of the greatest tension. A more reasonable criticism is that nothing new came of the conversation. The various sanctions Biden presumably outlined are unlikely to be different from the options already openly discussed, from extending controls on Russian banks’ access to credit markets to finally blocking Nord Stream 2. Likewise, Putin does not seem to have offered any new concessions or potential diplomatic solutions. The Kremlin and its usual mouthpieces have been floating the need for some more comprehensive security deal for some time now, and Russian forces are still building up around Ukraine’s borders. It’s good to talk However, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan affirmed after the event that “there is no substitute for direct dialogue between leaders, and that is true in spades when it comes to the U.S.-Russia relationship” and he is right. It would be a mistake to consider the conversation futile and fruitless. First of all, whatever was said, the simple fact that there was such a conversation matters. The Kremlin has internalized — and not without reason — that it is only really heard by the Americans when it makes a fuss and creates a problem. Putin’s people had been pushing for this contact and had it continued to be denied, there would have been a temptation for them to escalate in some way — though certainly not to the level of major military action — simply to make their case more compelling. Secondly, there is scope for some kind of human rapport. Foreign policy is at once dominated by intractable global processes and also deeply personal. Although there is no prospect of any kind of odd couple affinity as blossomed between Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan, for example, perhaps one of Biden’s only particular strengths appears to be his affability. To the best of my knowledge, no scholar has written specifically on the role of geniality in geopolitics (watch me be proven wrong). However, if he was able to convey not just toughness but also a genuine desire for dialogue — rather than, as the Kremlin sees it, the usual American assumption of automatic righteousness — then this may, in some admittedly very small way, offset the hawkish chorus Putin has installed around himself. Finally, as during the Geneva face-to-face summit, the conversation between presidents unlocks further, quieter, more technical discussions by their specialists. Sullivan noted that the U.S. and its “European allies would engage in a discussion that covers larger strategic issues, including our strategic concerns with Russia and Russia’s strategic concerns” — so long as Russia did not escalate. Putin clearly has some strange and unhealthy notions about Ukraine and the Ukrainian people that preclude them true agency and sovereignty. He is also by no means alone in believing that the West duped Moscow over NATO expansion, hence his likely unachievable desire for cast iron guarantees about what would, in effect, be the enforced ‘Finlandisation’ of Ukraine. At the same time, the nature of haggling is that both parties start with extreme bids, expecting to be negotiated towards the middle. It may well be that the gap is unbridgeable, and in any case this is not simply a deal to be struck between Moscow and Washington — it is not for either of them to dispose of Ukraine’s fate. However, insofar as any diplomatic solution may be achievable, that can only come when both sides talk.",1,868,71.71,31.68,32.08,26.24,28,29.84,82.95,65.55,53.69,7.95,2.65,0.23,0.35,0.12,1.04,0.69,5.3,15.55,7.37,0.81,15.32,7.83,7.03,7.14,1.73,12.9,8.18,3.23,5.18,1.04,1.38,2.76,14.86,0.69,13.94,2.53,1.38,1.5,2.53,2.42,4.03,0,4.15,2.19,1.73,0.46,0.12,0.12,0,0.12,0,0,9.68,5.65,0.81,0.23,0.46,0.35,3.57,4.03,0,0,0,1.04,3.8,2.42,1.27,0.12,1.96,0.12,0.12,1.27,0.58,0,0.35,0.23,0,0,0.12,0,0,0,0,0.35,0.46,0.12,0.12,0,0,0.12,1.04,0.46,3.34,8.87,0.46,1.38,6.91,0.35,0.23,0.12,3,3.92,4.03,1.04,0,0,0,0,0,15.67,4.49,5.88,0.12,0,2.19,3

Russian respondents’ approval of the president’s job performance dropped to 63% in November from 67% in October, according to the Levada Center pollster. Putin ordered a nationwide partial lockdown from Oct. 30-Nov. 7 in a bid to slow the virus’ spread after placing most Covid-19 response decisions in the hands of regional leaders for much of the pandemic. According to Levada, 57% of its respondents approved of their regional leaders in November, while 38% did not. Putin’s approval has yet to return to the highs it enjoyed following Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, as unpopular pension reforms and lagging living standards have fueled public discontent. While he has repeatedly urged Russians to get vaccinated with one of the country's Covid-19 vaccines amid widespread vaccine hesitancy, Putin still opposes the idea of mandatory vaccination. Key Putin allies who typically maintain relative popularity also saw their approval ratings drop from October to November, with Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin’s indicators both falling by 2%.

Spy Plane Nearly Caused Mid - Air  Catastrophe  ",English,Russia,"Moscow has said that a U.S. plane threatened civilian aircraft but ""catastrophe"" was avoided when a Russian passenger plane dived to avoid the NATO reconnaissance aircraft that crossed its path above the Black Sea. On Friday morning a NATO CL600 reconnaissance aircraft descended rapidly across the planned route for a Tel Aviv to Moscow Aeroflot service with 142 people on board, Russia's Federal Air Transport Agency said in a statement. The Aeroflot flight reportedly had to drop 500 meters (1,600 feet) to keep its distance from the reconnaissance aircraft, which the pilots saw from the cockpit with the naked eye. A second plane, a smaller CL650 aircraft, flying from the Black Sea resort Sochi to Skopje, the capital of Northern Macedonia, also had to divert to avoid the spy plane, the Russian air transport authority said Saturday. ""The direction and altitude of the commercial flights were immediately altered"" to avoid a collision, the agency said, adding that the unknown plane did not respond to radio hails from air traffic control. While the Federal Air Transport Agency did not say which nation had operated the spy plane, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova indicated on Sunday that the reconnaissance aircraft belonged to the United States. ""The actions of the U.S. Air Force have created a threat to civil aviation,"" Zakharova said on messaging app Telegram. ""If now a catastrophe in the airspace over the open waters of the Black Sea has been averted, this does not mean that the United States and NATO can continue to risk people's lives with impunity."" The Federal Air Transport Agency said it would lodge a diplomatic protest. ""Increased activity by NATO aircraft near Russia's borders, including above the Black Sea, creates a risk of dangerous accidents involving civilian aircraft,"" the agency said.

In a separate telegram to the 67-year-old Merkel, Putin thanked her for cooperation over the past 16 years and readiness for ""mutually respectful dialogue,"" using the familiar ""ty"" form of address in his message rather than the formal ""vy."" ""We were constantly in contact and tried to find ways out of even the most difficult situations,"" Putin said. ""We will of course continue our friendly interaction."" On Wednesday, the German parliament elected Scholz as chancellor as a new center-left-led coalition takes the wheel of Europe's top economy. The incoming government has pledged a tougher line with authoritarian states such as Russia after the business-driven pragmatism of the Merkel years. Despite their bitter differences, Merkel and Putin, who speak each other's languages, managed to keep talking throughout the outgoing German leader's years in office. Merkel was a proponent of direct talks with Putin and her ambivalent stance on Russia also frequently alienated partners, particularly in eastern Europe. She angered them especially with the controversial Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline set to carry Russian gas to Germany, which several eastern European countries believe will embolden Moscow at their expense. Germany imports around 40% of its gas from Russia and is set to receive even more via Nord Stream 2, a project that has raised U.S. concerns, divided Europe and angered EU ally Ukraine.",1,307,94.79,76.72,13.54,55.75,25.58,32.57,76.87,57.33,42.02,5.86,4.89,0.33,0.98,0.65,1.63,0.98,0.98,12.05,7.82,1.63,16.29,3.58,3.26,6.51,0,9.77,6.84,2.28,6.51,2.93,0.33,3.26,7.82,0,7.17,0.33,0.65,0.98,0.33,0.98,1.63,0,6.84,4.56,2.28,1.95,0.65,0.98,0,0.65,0,0,14.98,9.12,3.91,1.63,0.33,0,3.91,6.84,0,0.33,0.98,0.65,5.21,2.93,2.28,0,2.61,0,0,1.95,0.98,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.33,0.65,0,0,0,0,0.33,1.3,1.63,8.47,0.65,1.3,6.84,0.33,0,0,4.23,4.23,1.63,0.65,0.33,0.33,0,0,0,17.92,4.56,4.89,0,0,1.3,7.17

S . as Ukraine Tensions Soar,English,Russia,"President Vladimir Putin said Russia has sent the United States its proposals on mutual security guarantees amid high tensions between the countries over Ukraine, Interfax reported Wednesday. Russia’s Foreign Ministry passed the offer to U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Karen Donfried, who is in Moscow after visiting Kiev amid fears of Russia invading Ukraine. Putin reiterated his request to “immediately launch negotiations” with the U.S. and NATO on international legal guarantees for Russia’s security. Putin previously informed his Finnish counterpart of the offer. “The president expressed hope that the Americans and NATO members will respond positively to this,” Interfax quoted Putin’s senior foreign policy aide Yury Ushakov as saying. Putin’s demands include stopping NATO from expanding east, including closing Ukraine's door to membership, and halting its deployment of weapons in neighboring states. Ushakov said Putin informed Chinese President Xi Jinping of the U.S. and NATO security guarantee proposal during virtual talks Wednesday. “The Chinese president stressed that he […] fully supports our initiative to develop appropriate security guarantees for Russia,” Interfax quoted him as saying. Putin’s aide added that the Russian leader agreed to keep Xi informed “about how negotiations develop on this matter with American and NATO partners.” Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov has previously warned that Moscow could act militarily if the talks it demands do not materialize. U.S. President Joe Biden last week warned Putin of ""sanctions like he's never seen"" should the Russian troops massed on the Ukrainian border launch an attack. Putin denies planning an invasion, blaming the Western security alliance for the rise in tensions and demanding ""legal guarantees"" the alliance won't expand eastward.

The end of the Union brought with it a period of intense economic instability that plunged many into poverty, as newly independent Russia transitioned from communism to capitalism. RIA Novosti, reporting from excerpts of the documentary, said Putin had revealed that he worked occasionally as a taxi driver to boost his income. ""Sometimes I had to earn extra money,"" Putin said.

The Dec. 1-3 drills along the Strait of Malacca on the northeastern coast of Sumatra involve all 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Russia dispatched the large anti-submarine ship Admiral Panteleev for the marine phase of the two-part virtual and marine exercises. Agence France Presse reported that these were the first ever joint Russian-ASEAN naval exercises. According to the state-run TASS news agency, Rear Adm. Abdul Rasyid, the Indonesian Navy’s commander of the first fleet, said the maneuvers will “strengthen friendship” and “interaction and mutual understanding” between Russia and ASEAN. “These exercises are about peace, stability and prosperity in the region,” said Russia’s ambassador to ASEAN Alexander Ivanov. “We’re opening a new page in our strategic partnership,” added Ivanov, who attended the opening ceremony with Russia’s Ambassador to Indonesia Lyudmila Vorobyova. The Russian-ASEAN exercises are taking place against the backdrop of the Southeast Asian states’ growing tensions with China around its claim of the entire South China Sea. Russia has been forging closer ties with China since its relations with Western nations soured after it annexed Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula and is being accused of backing pro-Moscow rebels in the country’s southeast. In addition to Indonesia, the bloc comprises Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia, Myanmar and Brunei.

S . ",English,Russia,"The United States on Saturday urged Russia to pull back from the brink over Ukraine, warning that the G7 and its allies will impose tough measures if it abandons diplomacy. A senior State Department official told reporters at a meeting of the grouping's top diplomats in Liverpool, northwest England, that Moscow still had time to change course. ""But if they choose not to pursue that path, there will be massive consequences and severe costs in response, and the G7 is absolutely united in that,"" the official said. ""A large number of democratic countries will join us in imposing costs,"" they added. The warning came as Russian sabre-rattling against Ukraine and how to counter an increasingly assertive China dominated the first day of a two-day meeting of G7 foreign ministers in the British city. The meeting — at which ministers want to present a united front against authoritarianism — is the last in-person gathering of Britain's year-long G7 presidency, before it hands the baton to Germany. Opening the talks, Britain's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told delegates: ""We need to come together strongly to stand up to aggressors who are seeking to limit the bounds of freedom and democracy. ""To do this, we need to have a fully united voice. We need to expand our economic and security posture around the world."" Truss, in the job since September, set out her foreign policy vision in a major address on Wednesday, echoing U.S. threats of unprecedented sanctions if Russia invades Ukraine. Western concerns are growing over a Russian troop build-up on the border that the Kremlin says is defensive against any move by the former Soviet state eastwards towards NATO. G7 ministers want to show the grouping can move beyond condemnation to robustly defend its values as a deterrent to future threats. The meeting comes after U.S. President Joe Biden this week held a virtual summit with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to try to end the stand-off diplomatically.

618,themoscowtimes.com,1639555200,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/12/15/russias-third-cold-war-a75822,Russia Third Cold War - The Moscow Times,English,Russia,"While discussions abound on the internet concerning the results of the recent talks between President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Joe Biden — and with most suggesting that the Kremlin once again “outmaneuvered” his opponent by forcing the White House to assure the world of its adherence to the so-called Minsk Agreements and agree to freeze military aid to Ukraine — I would like to note that Russia has already effectively entered into a new Cold War with the West: a conflict that resembles not only the major Cold War of 1947-1986, but also the minor one of 1830-1856. A number of parallels exist between today’s events and those of the past. In each instance, Russia acted from a position of imagined moral superiority. Almost 200 years ago, it stood for “preserving the foundation” and conserving monarchical orders in Europe, defending that system from all manner of “nihilists.” After World War II, it spoke of the triumph of communism as the most progressive social system. Now, the Kremlin is repeating the idea that Russia stands in opposition to the pernicious and immoral West, that it is once again the defender of traditional values which the West is liable to desecrate. And each time, the confrontation began when Russia “bullied” Western proxies. In the first Cold War, this involved Russia’s suppression of the uprising in Poland in 1830, the revolution in Hungary in 1848 and the ultimatum in 1853 that Turkey grant a protectorate over its dominions inhabited primarily by Russian Orthodox. The second, larger Cold War began with the Soviet satellite states refusing to participate in the Marshall Plan and blockading West Berlin in 1947. Most recently, tensions escalated when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and undermined Ukraine’s territorial integrity through military intervention in Donbass in 2014-2015. And each time, events did not escalate into a “hot” or direct shooting war. Instead, the conflicts were limited to a peripheral theater of operations — such as the Crimean campaign of the 1850s; played out wherever in the world the interests of the warring parties clashed — as happened in the second half of the 20th century; or, as is happening now, boil down to the activities of quasi-military formations over which one side claims it has no control — and various types of terrorist actions. We shouldn’t forget that each time, Russia or the Soviet Union lacked the economic and technological might that would have given it the upper hand in the ensuing confrontation. Although Moscow has had the capability to wipe its enemy off the face of the earth ever since it developed nuclear weapons in the mid-20th century, it would have also been blown to smithereens in the process, with the result that it was unable to win any of these “cold wars,” and each of its defeats ended in a serious crisis of the entire social model of both the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union. However obvious these parallels might appear, Russia has made the same mistakes every time. First, it has earned a reputation in Europe and the West as an “evil empire” — if not through openly hostile actions, then through domestic policies and ideological aspirations — with which cooperation was, by definition, considered impossible. Second, in each of these “cold wars,” Russia found itself either alone or supported by only strategically insignificant satellite states, while it was opposed by an alliance of powerful and influential countries, thus foreordaining a pitiable outcome to the struggle. Third, this country reacted to each “cold war” by tightening the screws on its domestic policy, reducing freedoms and leading society into a kind of stupor that only ended when the federal authorities lost power during a subsequent episode of the confrontation with the West. Fourth — and this partly follows from the third point — as the conflict deepened, the Russian authorities increasingly lost touch with reality, leading them to make the mistakes that “broke the camel’s back” — the occupation of Moldova and Wallachia in 1853 and Afghanistan in 1979. In my opinion, we cannot separate what is happening now from the previous “cold wars” or the obvious lessons to be learned from them. Russia has repeatedly behaved impatiently and aggressively, while the West — that many Russian liberals now accuse of defeatism and conciliation — initially perceived those confrontations with St. Petersburg and Moscow as a long process in which their developing societies would inevitably prevail over the stagnant Russian or Soviet ones.

Held at Gostiny Dvor Dec. 2-6, it offers fiction, non-fiction, and pop science literature from 18 countries (including Israel, China, U.K., U.S, Ukraine, France and Japan); from 300 major publishing houses; with more than 500 special events and talks by authors and publishers from around the world; for upwards of 40,000 visitors every year, some of whom are also budding authors who sign contracts right on the spot. If you love books, you must go to this book fair. This year the special guest country is Germany, which means lots of books, authors, films, talks and other events in German and from Germany. There is a big section of kid’s books, one for comics and graphic novels, and a growing section of cookbooks.  Buy your ticket(s) ahead of time, dust off your book bags, take a look at the program of talks, demonstrations, and seminars, and plan your weekend. There are plenty of foreign language books and lots of foreign authors despite the coronavirus and other travel restrictions. More information in Russian and English and ticket purchases on the site here. The holiday season might be subdued this year in Moscow — like last year, there will be no fairs or activities in the city center — but that doesn’t mean you’ll have to sit home watching “It’s a Wonderful Life” on Netflix. On Dec. 24 you might want to experience the brilliance and triumph of Dmitry Shostakovich’s “Seventh Symphony,” also called the “Leningrad Symphony.” It will be performed on the main stage of the Zaryadye Concert Hall by the Russian State Orchestra, directed by Vasily Petrenko.  And on Dec. 25 at 1 p.m. the Cantus Boy’s Choir is performing a Christmas concert on the small stage. The choir is one of the finest in Russia, dedicated to the long tradition of church choral music in Russia. The program will be Russian and European Christmas music, although it ends of the very festive and light notes of “Jingle Bells” and “Jingle Bell Rock.” For more information and tickets, see the concert hall site. In many parts of the world, there is nothing that says “holidays” more than teddy bears. In some families children get new bears every year. In others, the parents do, too. Whether or not this is a tradition in your family, the Hello, Teddy exhibition will put you and your children in a bearish good mood. At Tishinka mall you can see 50,000 teddy bears, from some so small you can only see them under a microscope, to some so big you couldn’t pick them up. The stuffed bears have their friends on display, too: rabbits, badgers, foxes,  mice and other forest creatures. For more information and tickets, see the site here. This year on the first day of Hanukah, the Jewish Museum and Tolerance Center opened a very hands-on exhibition called Becoming Jewish. With artifacts — some quite rare — from private and public collections in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other parts of Russia, children are introduced to the traditions, holidays and games that once were part of most Jewish children’s lives in this part of the world. The curators worked on the exhibition for two years, designing it as one grand board game that will grab children’s interest and teach them while letting them be entertained. The show will run for four months until Purim. While you’re there, be sure to see the show “Snow on Grass” of works by the great animator Yuri Norshtein and the artist Francesca Norbusova. For more information about the show, see the site here. Maybe to compensate for the pandemic cancellations of holiday fairs and activities, maybe to make up for the cold slush and snow, or maybe just because Muscovites love jazz, there is something of a world-wide jazz festival this month. Tonight, Dec. 3 at 8 p.m., the Italian jazz band Conosci mia cugina has flown in from Rome to perform at Artnovi Space. Think swing. Tickets are 2,000 rubles and available here. If Italy isn’t hot enough for you, how about Brazil? On Sunday evening at 7:30 p.m. the rooftop restaurant-club Krym is hosting a Russian jazz group that has made the Bosa Nova their own. Tickets ranging from 1,500-1,700 rubles are available here.",1,732,86.89,61.96,27.07,65.45,17.43,20.9,81.15,59.29,48.22,6.15,3.42,0,0,2.32,0,0.82,2.73,14.62,7.79,3.42,14.62,5.87,4.37,6.97,0.82,11.07,6.28,6.15,1.91,0.96,0.55,0.55,7.65,0.68,6.69,1.23,0.55,0.68,1.64,0,3.14,0,3.83,3.28,0.41,0.96,0.68,0.14,0,0,0.14,0,7.51,1.78,0.14,0.14,0,0,0.96,5.33,0.27,0.27,0,0.14,1.37,0,1.37,0,8.61,3.96,0.27,2.87,0.55,0.96,0.82,0.27,0.27,0,0,0,0,0.27,0,0.41,0.14,0.68,0,0.27,0,0.14,0,0.14,6.42,11.2,0.27,0.96,7.24,1.91,0.82,0.41,2.87,1.23,4.23,1.78,0.68,0.68,0.14,0,0,20.08,6.56,8.06,0.14,0,1.5,3.83

The unlikely artist is Viktor Bout, also known as the “merchant of death,” a former Russian arms dealer serving a 25-year sentence in a U.S. jail who was the inspiration for the 2005 Hollywood movie ""Lord of War"" starring Nicolas Cage. “We held the exhibition to show that Viktor still has the will to go on, despite his difficult situation,” said Bout’s wife Alla, who runs the Road to Home foundation which lobbies for her husband’s release. Alla also said she hoped the exhibition would keep her husband in the news. “It is also important to remind people that he is still in jail, a lot of time has passed since he was first arrested,” she added. Bout, a former army lieutenant, has so far spent 11 years in an American prison after his 2008 arrest in Thailand in an elaborate sting operation, during which U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents posed as Colombian Marxist rebels seeking to buy an arsenal of modern weapons. Throughout his incarceration, Bout has been linked repeatedly with prisoner swaps involving Americans jailed in Russia. Most recently, reports have emerged that Bout could be exchanged for Paul Whelan, a former security official at an auto parts company who was arrested in December 2018 on charges of espionage, or Trevor Reed, who was arrested in 2019 for a brawl in which he punched two Russian police officers. However, as the threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine has become a global talking point over the last month, it’s unlikely the topic of prisoner exchange will be raised during Tuesday’s high-stakes virtual summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his U.S. counterpart Joe Biden. U.S. prosecutors have alleged that Bout's weapons fueled armed conflicts in some of the world's bloodiest hot spots, including Rwanda, Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Bout has always insisted he was a legitimate businessman. The Moscow exhibition includes 24 of Bout’s portraits, landscapes and still lives — including a number of self portraits behind bars featuring his signature mustache. The works are in pencil, ballpoint pen, pastels, wax crayons and oil paints provided by the United States Penitentiary in Marion. Alla Bout said each drawing “had a very difficult path to Russia,” having been flown into the country by Russian diplomatic staff. “Viktor would send the drawings to the Russian embassy in Washington and our diplomats would take one of the pieces every time they flew home on holiday,” she said. The exhibition opened on Monday, with a number of government-linked guests in attendance, including Maria Butina, the high-profile gun rights activist who spent 15 months in U.S. prison after admitting to working as an unregistered Russian agent. Butina, who returned to Russia in October 2019 and now has a seat in Russia’s parliament, has been one of Bout’s most vocal supporters. “When I saw the painting I felt the pain Bout is going through. Pain that made me feel I am still behind bars too,” Butina, who runs a foundation supporting Russians jailed abroad, told The Moscow Times by phone. Moscow has regularly slammed Bout’s case as political, pointing to statements made by U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin — who presided over Bout’s case in Manhattan — in an interview with The New York Times in which she said she believed the sentence was “excessive and inappropriate.” “I really hope America will agree to exchange prisoners, including Bout, so that he and others can spend time with his family during Christmas. That would help restore relations that are currently at a low point,” Butina said, adding that she wasn’t expecting the topic to be raised today. Bout’s lawyer Alexei Tarasov said on Monday there has been no progress on the issue of his exchange. “I don’t see any indications that my clients will be discussed at the talks,” the lawyer told the Russian state news agency TASS. And while the exhibition’s main aim is to bring renewed attention to Bout’s case, Alla said Viktor’s hobby has also helped keep him sane during his time behind bars. ""For Viktor himself, this is a kind of meditation, when he can be distracted from the conditions facing him in jail, from the gray walls. Through art he can be transported to some other world, the world of freedom.""",1,738,90.77,63.32,16.43,11.86,27.33,23.58,79.54,57.32,46.34,8.4,5.96,0.95,0.27,0,3.52,0.14,2.44,13.96,8.67,2.03,15.31,7.45,2.85,3.93,0.41,13.69,4.34,3.25,5.42,1.08,0.54,3.79,7.05,0.41,6.37,0.95,0.41,1.36,0.68,0.14,2.03,0.14,3.79,1.49,2.3,0.68,0.41,0.27,0,0,0,0,12.06,4.61,0.27,0.14,0.27,0.41,2.44,7.05,0.41,0.14,1.22,2.71,4.34,2.57,1.49,0.27,5.15,1.08,0.27,2.57,0.68,0.81,1.22,0.68,0.27,0.14,0.14,0,0,0,0.14,0,0.27,0.14,0,0.14,0,0,0.54,0.14,3.52,10.7,0.54,1.76,7.32,0.54,0,0.81,4.61,6.1,4.47,1.08,0.14,0,0.14,0,0,17.48,5.28,6.23,0,0,2.44,3.52

Kennedy who first popularized the saying, “Victory has 100 fathers, but defeat is an orphan”, they like repeating it so much that one might say it has now become part of the Russian culture. However, this adage doesn’t seem to apply to the mass protests for fair elections in 2011-2012 because, although everyone admits that those demonstrations ended in defeat, many people are still vying to be considered the father of that defeat. For the first time in modern Russian history, tens of thousands of indignant citizens took to the streets of Moscow and other large Russian cities and, over many months, peacefully but persistently demanded respect for their rights. One year later, that wave of civic enthusiasm gave way to despondency as the authorities responded with criminal cases and police violence, a crackdown on freedoms, media owners who had indirectly supported the protests replaced with Kremlin loyalists, and public figures who had delivered speeches at the rallies subjected to coordinated harassment. Several non-conformist deputies of the State Duma — the same Duma that had been elected with the help of falsified results — were even forced to leave the country. For all of the next 10 years, we have witnessed the Kremlin’s reaction to the sudden humiliation it suffered back then. The increasingly repressive measures, the spate of criminal cases, the new laws against “foreign agents”, proxy wars and state television’s ever more toxic propaganda — all this is a consequence of those peaceful rallies. And if Russian leaders consider the rally on Bolotnaya Square on Dec. 10, 2011 as “ground zero” in this battle, then they see the country’s intelligentsia as the masterminds behind the attack on their authority and have pushed to alienate it from the state ever since. The Kremlin propaganda machine has waged a war against the intelligentsia, portraying it as the driving force behind the protests, as funded by the West, as pro-gay and pro-Ukraine — in short, as pro-everything that ordinary working Russians oppose. That is why, when the anniversary of those events rolls around every December, all the numerous “fathers” of that defeat among the Russian intelligentsia (yours truly included) engage in painful reflection on the question of what we did wrong. Setting aside the somewhat hackneyed remark that painful reflection has been a hereditary trait of the Russian intelligentsia since the time of Chekhov’s plays, let us ask a better question instead: Is there an error in this logic? When we ask, “Why did the Russian opposition lose in 2011?” we ipso facto assume that it could have won had it made different decisions. Among the alternate scenarios must often cited are if protesters had held an unsanctioned rally outside the Kremlin walls in place of the sanctioned gathering it did hold on Bolotnaya Square — on a strategically inconvenient island in the middle of the Moscow River — and if opposition leaders had not left town over the long New Year’s holiday. But just for a change, maybe we should ask whether protesters ever had any chance at all of winning. It now increasingly appears that they did not. That possibility simply didn’t exist because Russian society was completely different 10 years ago. In 2009-2010, the largest rallies in Russia had brought together only 100-200 people — not counting a riot by violent nationalist football fans. What’s more, the great majority of people had no experience  whatever of political action — with the possible exception of older citizens who had attended rallies during the collapse of the Soviet Union — and protest organizers had no experience providing legal assistance to detainees and financial assistance to individuals and organizations subjected to repression. For today’s 20-year-olds in Russia, sending a donation of even a few dollars a month to help keep persecuted media outlets stay afloat and attending an unsanctioned rally is as natural as brushing your teeth. Ten years ago, this was all new. At that time, civil society was just emerging in Russia. It was in its infancy, naive and overly optimistic. Don’t let your eyes fool you, though. To a casual observer, it seems that little has changed between the Russia of 2011 and that of today. After all, opposition leader Alexei Navalny is behind bars, his organization has been disbanded, all independent media outlets have been branded with the onerous label of foreign agent and, once again, it seems that no one is stirring and all is quiet on the protest front. This is not the case, however. There is a huge difference in today’s society. Ten years ago, politics was not even on the agenda. Yes, many thousands of people took to the streets, but they did so with an underlying complacency. Now, politics is front and center. The fact that citizens’ political demands have been strangled and shoved under the carpet so as not to be an eyesore has only made people angrier. Just imagine: in every major Russian city, there are now thousands of people with experience in direct political action, solidarity, donating to a cause and signing petitions. And if to include their friends, relatives and co-workers in the ranks of these “reserves”, the number is even larger. But most importantly, Russia has accumulated a great deal of emotional baggage, a sort of collective grievance with the authorities. Yes, the Bolotnaya rallies failed. But they couldn’t have succeeded anyway because they were only the starting point. They served as the trigger for two things: the Kremlin’s aggressively repressive policy, but also as a kind of “civil society university”, an impulse to instruct countless members of the intelligentsia and middle class in the ways of political action. It’s like the “thesis and antithesis” of Hegel’s philosophy. And no one knows what the ultimate “synthesis” will be.",1,964,80.78,44.98,42.76,17.81,22.95,27.28,87.24,65.56,52.49,7.88,2.59,0,0.62,0.41,0.1,1.04,5.29,17.22,9.44,2.39,14.11,7.37,4.88,7.05,1.45,12.03,7.99,5.91,7.99,1.76,1.04,5.29,12.45,2.28,9.96,2.07,1.97,0.41,2.28,0.41,3.94,0,6.33,3.01,3.22,1.35,0.21,1.04,0,0.41,0.1,0,10.48,4.88,0.93,0,1.87,0.41,1.87,5.19,0.41,0.1,0,0.41,3.22,1.76,1.24,0.21,2.9,0.62,0.1,1.45,0.62,0.1,0.73,0.41,0.21,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0.1,0,0.52,0,0,0,0.52,0.41,0.21,4.46,7.78,0,1.14,5.6,0.73,0.1,0.21,4.88,5.81,3.73,0.21,0.21,0,0.21,0,0,15.46,4.36,5.81,0.21,0,1.66,3.42

Putin skipped both the G20 and COP26 and an expected trip to China was rescheduled due to Covid, yet the Russian leader has decided to travel to New Delhi. This step is hopefully more than mere symbolism in the traditionally warm Russo-Indian relations and not simply a signal that at a time of increasingly tense relations with the West, Russia has important friends elsewhere in the world. Still, even if Russia’s relations with India are good, in order for them to become great, a major effort is needed. The July 2021 edition of Russia’s National Security Strategy describes relations with New Delhi as a “special privileged strategic partnership,” and discusses them in the same paragraph as Russo-Chinese ties. The personal chemistry between Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is excellent. Recently, Modi has demonstrated India’s interest in economic projects in Russia’s Far East, thus extending New Delhi’s Look East policy all the way to Vladivostok. Over Washington’s objections, India has gone ahead with the purchase of Russian-made S-400 air defense systems, due to be delivered before the end of the year. Modi is also one of only four foreign leaders to have been awarded Russia’s top decoration, the Order of St. Andrew. Ordinary Russians see India as a reliably friendly country with which their own nation has a virtually problem-free relationship. For their part, most Indians regard Russia as a proven friend that in the course of India’s seventy-five years of independence has never caused their country strategic harm. Yet issues are piling up on many fronts, requiring both the Indian and Russian leaderships to rethink, adjust, and upgrade the relationship to make it fit for the twenty-first century environment. In global geopolitical terms, the main issue is that Moscow and New Delhi, traditional friends and longtime allies, now find themselves ever more closely linked to two rival superpowers, China and the United States. Moreover, India’s relations with China following the 2020 border clashes in the Himalayas, and Russia’s with the United States since the 2014 Ukraine crisis, can be described as confrontation. Thus, in a situation when their best friends are bonding with their worst enemies, the main task for both New Delhi and Moscow is to shield the Indo-Russian strategic partnership from the wider and increasingly adverse global context, and uphold mutual trust. In geoeconomic terms, despite ongoing cooperation in areas ranging from nuclear energy to outer space to the Arctic, not to mention armaments development and production, the obvious weakness of the Indo-Russian relationship is its small and stagnant trade volumes. With America and China — despite the bad political relationship with the latter — India, a fast-rising economy, trades to the tune of $100 billion each, while commerce with Russia still languishes around a mere $10 billion. The reason is again plain to see: While 85% of India’s economy is now in private hands, Indo-Russian economic ties still rest on government-to-government agreements. After the old model of Soviet-Indian economic relations collapsed in 1991, trade volumes plummeted. The U.S.S.R. used to be among India’s top three economic partners; the Russian Federation’s current rank is in the twentieth to twenty-fifth range. Still, Russia remains strong in some important niches, above all military-technical cooperation. Since India’s first purchase of Mig-21 fighters back in 1962, arms trade has been the cornerstone of bilateral relations. Yet India’s growing desire to diversify its arms imports and, recently, its clear intention to develop and produce weapons systems itself, have led to a slump in Russia’s share of the Indian arms market. As a result, Russia’s share of that market has shrunk to just under 50%. There is ever stronger competition from Europe and even more so from the United States. For all their professed pivot to Asia, the current Russian elites remain Eurocentric to the core, and have little time for India. Russia’s government-owned corporations and private business actors find it much easier and more profitable to do business with China than with India. Russian media outlets have little presence in India and do a mediocre job of explaining Indian politics and policies to their audiences. The Russian public has very limited knowledge and understanding of what is going on in India. Tourism and cultural contacts have been picking up in recent years, but the pandemic has severely limited them. An effort to revive the practice of inviting Indian students to study at Russian universities, after an initially promising start, has also suffered from Covid-related restrictions. Ironically, India’s elites are also Western-centric, but unlike Russia’s, they are also Western-leaning, and particularly focused on the United States. Their ambition is to become part of the global elite. To them, Russia is not a priority, and interest in it is scant. The Indian media has virtually no correspondents based in Russia. To cover Russia-related issues, Indian media editors usually rely on Western — mostly American and British — reporting and analysis, which is highly critical of Russian policies. Tellingly, India’s vibrant technology sector has very few contacts with Russia and Russians. All these problems are too big to be resolved in a single and short presidential visit. However, they must not be ignored if the Indo-Russian strategic partnership is to live up to its name in the decade ahead. The Russians need to step back and decide what it is they want from the Indian connection, what the opportunities for and obstacles to this desired state of relations are, and what must be done in order to achieve their objectives. From this perspective, three actions are of central importance for Russia as it proceeds along this path: to rethink, to adjust, and to upgrade. Rethink means, above all, seeing India for what it is and where it is headed. Far too many in Russian elite circles still regard India as the third world country that it was during the heyday of Soviet-Indian friendship in the 1960s–1980s. Those people have clearly missed India’s stunning economic and technological success of the past three decades. As a result, Russia should not expect its large neighbor in Eurasia to act as a non-aligned inward-looking nation, keeping a low profile in international relations and behaving like a middle power. Instead, Russians should acknowledge India’s new status and self-image as a great power, its focus on rapid economic development, and its ambition to become a global economic powerhouse and a leader in modern technologies. They need to understand the fundamental reasons behind India’s growing closeness with the United States, and its increasing hostility with China. Thus, a rethink requires a much closer study of modern India, and a deeper understanding of that vast and highly complex nation, which is rising to the level of a world power. This can be achieved by supporting Indian and South Asian studies in Russia; expanding media coverage of Indian political, economic, and diplomatic developments; and promoting scientific, educational, and cultural ties, as well as tourism and other people-to-people connections. Adjust means factoring in all these realities in developing Russia’s own strategy toward India: something that does not currently exist. It is clear that cultivating and developing the strategic partnership should remain the overall objective of this yet-to-be-devised strategy. However, the partnership should be structured and styled as one of equals, with Moscow dropping all residual vestiges of its previously sometimes patronizing attitudes to its Indian counterparts. On the conceptual level, Russia needs to take a second look at New Delhi’s Indo-Pacific strategy. An in-depth strategic dialogue with New Delhi on that subject could dispel Moscow’s presently negative and suspicious attitude to the strategy. The Russians need to accept that New Delhi’s ideas have different sources and objectives than Washington’s similarly titled strategy. Essentially, India’s new strategy is a logical continuation of its Look East policy. By the same token, Moscow could increase mutual trust with New Delhi by working through and patiently dispelling Indian concerns regarding Russia’s strategic ties with China and its situational cooperation with Pakistan. These clarifying discussions could pave the way to engaging New Delhi in a strategic dialogue on Greater Eurasia, which is the strategic framework for Moscow’s approach. One might consider amplifying Russia’s traditionally continental geopolitical concept by adding a maritime element covering the seas and oceans washing Eurasia. For the purposes of a geopolitical dialogue with India, the relevant areas could include the Arctic, the Pacific, and the Indian Ocean — all the way from Murmansk to Mumbai. By the same token, India’s strategy, which so far has been couched predominantly in maritime terms, might get a continental dimension, starting with Afghanistan, Central Asia, and Iran. Creating synergies between Moscow and New Delhi’s strategies in both domains could be a tantalizing proposition. On this basis, Moscow needs to engage more closely with New Delhi as it further fleshes out the idea of a Greater Eurasian partnership. Maintaining strategic partnerships with both India and China at bilateral and trilateral (RIC) levels is crucial for general geopolitical stability in Eurasia. Russia, which has neither the ambition nor the resources to dominate Greater Eurasia, could play a key role in maintaining Eurasian equilibrium, which requires Russo-Indo-Chinese understanding. While being realistic about its partners and their complicated relations, Russia needs to proactively facilitate efforts at better understanding between New Delhi and Beijing, and promote positive interaction among the three great powers. Such interaction is also needed for engagement with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), a key aspect of the Greater Eurasian Partnership. It is even more necessary for building up the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) as a continent-wide dialogue platform. Moreover, close relations with New Delhi would help Moscow in engaging pragmatically on Eurasian/Indo-Pacific issues with Washington and Tokyo, which are linked with New Delhi through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue. Much as India finds Russia’s partnership with China useful for managing its own relations with Beijing, Moscow could use its close relations with New Delhi to weigh in diplomatically on the Indo-Pacific agenda. India, which is genuinely interested in an improved relationship between Russia and the United States, might be useful here. At the global level, Russia would benefit from closer interaction with India not only within the BRICS, but also at the United Nations. On a number of regional issues, from Afghanistan to the Persian Gulf and the broader Middle East, India needs to be treated as Russia’s privileged interlocutor and partner. Sidelining New Delhi, as has occasionally happened in discussions on Afghanistan, should never happen again. New global issues, from the spread of pandemics to climate change and energy transition, open up broad new areas for Russia-India cooperation, even as they require the careful management of differences. Engaging early with each other would favor cooperative elements over competitive ones and make it possible to chart a coordinated approach to what have become vital issues for the world community. Upgrade means elevating Russia’s relations with India to the level of its other strategic partnership: with China. This does not mean that Moscow-New Delhi ties must resemble Moscow-Beijing ones. The two relationships are very different, as is the wider context in which they operate. The idea is above all to explore and exploit economic opportunities, without which relations with India will always lag behind those with China. There have been many attempts to expand Indo-Russian economic ties, but progress in that direction has been painfully slow. Most of these efforts have followed the well-trodden path of government-to-government contracts, which is not to be abandoned. One opportunity at hand that is truly unique is deepening military-technical cooperation. For decades, Russia has been the leading provider of weapons systems for the Indian military. For its part, India is serious in pressing ahead with the Make in India model. It also has much more to offer in terms of advanced technology, particularly in the information sphere. There have been several examples of successful Russo-Indian weapons development and production, like the BrahMos missile. Compared to other weapons producers, Russia is more flexible in engaging collaboratively with others. This is probably the way to go. One has to be realistic. The Indian and Russian economies remain far less complementary than those of China and Russia. The Russian and Indian business communities are largely disinterested in each other’s countries, where they see few opportunities for themselves. This can only be changed by a joint effort in creative thinking. At their upcoming meeting, President Putin and Prime Minister Modi need to stimulate such an effort by ordering an in-depth study of potential areas of cooperation to be conducted in time for their next annual get-together.

Kiev has been battling a pro-Moscow insurgency in two breakaway regions bordering Russia since 2014, when the Kremlin annexed Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula. Russia has massed troops near Ukraine's borders and the West has for weeks accused it of planning an invasion, warning Moscow of massive sanctions should it launch an attack. The Ukrainian army said separatists had targeted its positions with grenade launchers and mortars. ""One serviceman was fatally wounded,"" and another soldier was injured, it said on Facebook. Kiev and its allies accuse Russia of supporting the rebels militarily — claims which Moscow denies. The latest death brings Ukraine's toll in the simmering conflict to 65 since the start of the year, according to an AFP tally based on official figures, compared to a total of 50 in all of 2020. Russia has massed around 100,000 troops on its side of the border. U.S. President Joe Biden warned his Russian counterpart President Vladimir Putin of ""sanctions like he's never seen"" should the troops attack Ukraine. European Union leaders on Thursday urged Moscow to halt its military build-up and return to talks led by France and Germany.

Apparently Not,English,Russia,"At dinner at the American ambassador’s residence in Moscow some years ago, I asked a former senior foreign policy official if anyone in the Kremlin understood Ukraine.  He replied that someone there understood Ukraine very well.  He then added “but nobody listens to him.” The abject failure of Russian policy toward Ukraine over the past seven years suggests the Kremlin and Vladimir Putin have a flawed understanding of the country. On Dec. 17, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, “Have we [Russia] lost Ukraine as a partner, ally and so on?  At this point, yes, completely.” The Russian leadership presumably did not intend this.  Thus, the question of whether the Kremlin and Putin understand Ukraine.  Many signs suggest that they do not. Putin’s last visit to Kiev occurred in 2013, when he traveled to mark the 1025th anniversary of Kievan Rus’s acceptance of Christianity. In a speech Putin said, “We are all spiritual heirs of what happened here 1025 years ago.  And in this sense we [Ukrainians and Russians] are, without a doubt, one people.” What an utterly tone-deaf statement to make in Ukraine.  Millions of ethnic Ukrainians heard it as a denial of their culture, history and language.  Putin has since often repeated that point. Russia’s use of military force to seize Crimea following the Maidan Revolution could hardly be expected to win over Ukrainian sympathies.  Nor would sparking and sustaining a conflict in Donbas that has now claimed more than 13,000 lives. Shortly after the Russia-Ukraine conflict began in 2014, Putin and other Russians started speaking of “Novorossiya” — the idea that much of eastern and southern Ukraine would rise in revolt against Kiev.  The allure of Novorossiya held sway in Moscow long after it became clear that there was little enthusiasm among Ukrainians for breaking away. Volodymyr Zelenskiy won the Ukrainian presidency in 2019.  He came to office a political novice who comfortably spoke Russian and promised a different approach from that of his predecessor, whom Moscow despised.  Zelensky endorsed the Minsk agreements as the basis for resolving the Donbas conflict and spoke approvingly of the “Steinmeier formula” for moving forward—politically risky steps for the new president given growing frustration and anger in Ukraine about the failure of the Minsk agreements to deliver peace in Donbas. What did that get Zelensky?  Putin agreed to a meeting in December 2019 with the Ukrainian leader, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron.  The meeting produced agreement on a prisoner exchange, a full ceasefire in Donbass and a follow-up meeting in spring 2020.  Only the prisoner exchange occurred. Rather than seek compromise, the Kremlin leaders seemed to calculate that they could force the newcomer to make humiliating concessions. Moscow increasingly took the position that it was not a party to the conflict — despite a Russian signature to the Minsk II agreement — and sought to force Kiev to deal directly with the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk “people’s republics.”  The Kremlin now swats away any request by Zelensky to meet Putin. The unsurprising result:  Zelenskiy’s attitude toward Moscow has hardened.  While he brought to office an ambivalent view of the Ukraine-NATO relationship, he now publicly calls for an early membership path for Ukraine. Kremlin policy has driven Ukraine away.  More than anything else, it has persuaded the Ukrainian government and an increasingly large segment of the Ukrainian population that they can find security and stability only if their country is anchored in institutions such as the European Union and NATO.  The Kremlin appears intent on continuing this course.  Putin released an essay in July in which he all but denied Ukraine’s right to exist as a sovereign nation.  In October, former President Dmitry Medvedev termed talking to Kiev “pointless.” The Russian military has massed tens of thousands of troops and tanks, artillery and other combat vehicles in staging areas near Ukraine, suggesting that Russia is preparing a major military assault. That would not bring Ukraine back to Russia.  It would instead generate more sanctions on Russia, an increased flow of Western arms to Ukraine, a bolstering of NATO military presence near Russia’s borders — and dead Russian soldiers. The Russian military is undoubtedly stronger, but the Ukrainian military would exact a price.  Moreover, Kiev is preparing for partisan warfare, and an early December poll showed that one-third of those asked, including one-fourth in the country’s east, would take up arms if the Russians invade. It is time for the Russian leadership to reexamine the premises on which it has based its approach.  Bad understanding leads to bad policy, and the Kremlin appears poised to make another in a line of mistakes in its approach toward Ukraine.  This one would prove a tragedy for Ukraine … but also for Russia.",1,786,92.88,46.07,38.7,9.28,17.47,31.17,81.17,58.27,46.95,7.51,2.54,0.13,0.38,0,1.15,0.64,4.96,14.89,9.41,1.78,15.52,4.07,3.56,6.23,0.76,10.43,4.71,3.94,7.25,1.27,0.64,5.47,11.96,0.51,11.2,2.04,2.04,1.4,1.91,0.64,3.69,0,4.45,1.65,2.8,1.4,0.25,0.89,0,0.38,0.13,0,10.94,5.6,0.64,0.13,1.15,0,2.42,5.22,0.13,0.13,0,1.15,6.49,3.69,2.8,0,2.29,0.13,0.13,1.65,0.13,0.25,0.76,0.13,0,0.13,0,0,0,0.13,0.13,0,0,0.64,0,0.13,0,0.38,0.25,0,2.93,10.18,0.25,1.65,7.25,0.51,0.25,0.13,4.33,4.83,2.8,0.38,0.13,0,0.13,0,0,14.25,5.6,3.94,0.25,0,1.15,3.31

S .- NATO Talks,English,Russia,"President Vladimir Putin on Thursday accused the West of lying to Russia on NATO's expansion but noted “positive” developments with Washington over Moscow's demands for security guarantees, with direct talks expected in Geneva next year. The West has for weeks accused Russia of massing troops near its border with Ukraine and planning an invasion against Kiev. Asked about whether a war against Ukraine was a realistic possibility, Putin replied that Russia was responding to threats from Kiev and that its actions regarding Ukraine “depend on our security,” not on how talks with the U.S. proceed. “We have to keep an eye on what is happening in Ukraine, and on when they might attack,” he told journalists at his annual end-of-year press conference. “One gets the impression that [Ukraine] is preparing a third military campaign and we’re being warned not to interfere and not defend [Russian-speaking residents in eastern Ukraine] or face new sanctions,” Putin said. “We must react and do something about it.” At the same time, Putin said that ongoing negotiations with the United States on Russia’s proposed security guarantees were “positive” and hinted at fresh direct talks in the new year. “U.S. partners told us that they are ready to begin this discussion, these talks, at the very start of next year in Geneva,” Putin said. Putin repeated his demand that “there must not be any eastward NATO expansion,” one of several points in a draft list of security guarantees that Russia is seeking from the U.S.-led military bloc. “We were fooled by five waves of NATO’s eastward expansion. We’re not threatening anyone, they came to us. You’re asking us for guarantees, but it’s you who needs to give us guarantees immediately.” Putin then slammed Ukraine's development in recent years, saying there is “complete poverty"" in the country. He called the 2014 Maidan Revolution a “bloody coup d’etat” and accused Ukrainian “extremists” of planning operations to retake Crimea and the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine. Putin also defended Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and support of pro-Moscow rebels in the Donbass, saying that inhabitants of both regions had always thought of themselves as Russians. He stressed that Donbass residents alone should determine the region's future, adding that Russia was ready to act as a mediator to ""create a better future for the people living there.”",1,388,83.21,68.64,34.87,6.73,24.25,26.8,85.31,61.86,47.42,10.57,5.67,0,2.58,0.52,1.29,1.03,4.9,12.37,6.19,1.55,15.98,6.19,3.09,4.9,1.29,14.95,5.15,2.58,9.54,3.09,1.03,5.41,9.54,0.26,9.28,1.55,1.29,1.03,1.8,1.29,3.09,0,4.64,1.55,3.09,0.26,0,0.26,0.26,0,0,0.26,15.98,8.76,0.77,0.26,1.55,0.77,4.9,6.44,0,0,0,1.29,4.9,4.12,0.77,0,1.8,0,0.52,1.03,0.26,0,0.77,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.29,0,0.26,0.26,0.26,0,0,1.8,0.26,2.84,9.28,0.52,0.77,7.73,0.26,0,0,5.15,4.12,4.64,3.61,0,0,0,0,0,21.91,5.67,4.12,0,0,3.09,9.02

S ., Russia to Hold Security , Ukraine Talks Early January in Geneva",English,Russia,"The United States and Russia will hold much-anticipated talks in early January on European security and the Ukraine conflict after Moscow demanded NATO halt its eastward expansion. A spokesperson for the U.S. National Security Council told AFP late Monday that the talks with Russia will take place on Jan. 10. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov on Tuesday confirmed the date and said that the talks will take place in Geneva, where U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian leader Vladimir Putin met for their first summit in June. The Kremlin has grown increasingly insistent that the West and NATO are encroaching dangerously close to Russia's borders. Moscow earlier this month presented the West with sweeping security demands, saying NATO must not admit new members and seeking to bar the United States from establishing new bases in former Soviet republics. ""The United States looks forward to engaging with Russia,"" the National Security Council spokesperson said. ""When we sit down to talk, Russia can put its concerns on the table and we will put our concerns on the table with Russia's activities as well."" The Biden administration has insisted on taking action in lockstep with European allies. A US official said Tuesday that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered the USS Harry Truman carrier strike group to stay in the Mediterranean and hold off on sailing on to the Middle East. The purpose of the order was ""to reassure our allies and partners of our commitment to collective defence,"" the official said. Moscow and NATO representatives are also expected to meet on Jan. 12, while the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), which includes Russia and the United States, will address the tensions the following day. Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau of Poland, which takes the helm of the OSCE in the new year, will address the meeting, said a spokesperson for the organization founded during the Cold War as a forum involving Moscow and the West. The talks come after weeks of heightening tensions, with Washington accusing Russia of massing tens of thousands of troops around ex-Soviet Ukraine and plotting a winter invasion. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Moscow in the talks would take a ""hard line"" aimed at defending its interests and avoiding ""concessions."" At the United Nations, Russia's deputy envoy, Dmitry Polyanskiy, said the talks should be ""serious"" but also that Russia's draft agreements were not an ""ultimatum"" to the United States. ""I don't think that our colleagues will get away with some blah blah blah thing,"" he told reporters. ""It's a constructive proposal, but it's the proposal that works for everybody and that is in the interest of everybody,"" he said. Ukraine has been seeking to break from Moscow's sphere of influence and eventually join the NATO alliance. Russia already occupies a swath of its neighbor in the Crimean peninsula and is accused of fomenting a separatist pro-Moscow rebellion in the industrial east of the country. Deployment by Russia of tens of thousands of troops to the border sparked fears in Kiev and among its Western allies of a wider war, possibly including further seizures of Ukrainian territory. Putin denies planning to attack the neighboring country, saying the troop movements are to defend Russia against an encroaching Western military. The United States and its European partners have threatened to impose harsh economic sanctions if Russia invades Ukraine, while also offering to hold negotiations. The National Security Council spokesperson said Ukraine's interests would not be ignored in cutting any deal with Russia. Negotiations will include ""nothing about our allies and partners without our allies and partners, including Ukraine,"" the spokesperson said. ""President Biden's approach on Ukraine has been clear and consistent: unite the alliance behind two tracks — deterrence and diplomacy. We are unified as an alliance on the consequences Russia would face if it moves on Ukraine."" There was no immediate word on who would represent the two sides on Jan. 10. The meeting is part of the Strategic Security Dialogue initiative launched by Biden and Putin, which initially has focused on resuscitating post-Cold War nuclear arms control treaties.",1,682,94.13,69.91,23.15,11.31,22,30.06,82.4,57.48,43.7,5.87,2.2,0.15,1.47,0,0.29,0.15,3.67,14.37,9.82,1.17,14.66,5.57,2.2,5.87,0.88,12.76,5.28,1.91,9.97,4.84,1.03,4.25,5.57,0.59,4.99,0.44,0.73,1.03,0.59,0,2.2,0,3.81,1.47,2.35,0.59,0,0.59,0.15,0,0,0,14.81,9.09,1.76,0,0.88,0.29,4.99,6.89,0,0,0,0.29,6.6,5.28,1.17,0.15,3.37,0,0.44,2.79,0.15,0,0.59,0.29,0.29,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.15,0,0.88,0,0,0.44,0,1.61,0.29,3.08,10.26,0.88,1.32,7.33,0.29,0,0.59,3.96,3.96,3.96,1.91,0,0,0,0,0,14.52,5.13,3.52,0,0,1.47,4.4

European Union leaders, meeting in Brussels, insisted on ""the urgent need for Russia to de-escalate tensions caused by the military build-up along its border with Ukraine and aggressive rhetoric"". They reiterated a threat to impose ""massive consequences and severe cost"" on Moscow through sanctions, coordinated with the EU's partners in London and Washington. The U.S. has used similar language of ""massive"" retaliation in the event of a Russian invasion while attempting to reach out to Moscow to defuse the situation. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg branded Russia the ""aggressor"". Russian President Vladimir Putin wants direct dialogue with U.S. counterpart Joe Biden to resolve the stand-off, and is seeking security guarantees to stand down his troops. But the European leaders in their summit pushed for a return to the ""Normandy format"", a four-way dialogue between Paris, Berlin, Kiev and Moscow. On Wednesday, Russia handed a list of security demands to US Assistant Secretary of State Karen Donfried, who then came to NATO headquarters in Brussels to discuss them with Stoltenberg. The NATO chief also met Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and gave a joint news conference to insist that any decision on membership was a matter for Kiev and the alliance's 30 member states. ""We will not compromise on the right of Ukraine to choose its own path. We will not compromise on the right for NATO to protect and defend all NATO allies,"" Stoltenberg said. He said there would also be no compromising on NATO's partnership with Ukraine, describing it as important for both sides and ""not in any way a threat to Russia"". On Wednesday, Zelenskiy attended a prior summit with EU leaders — most of whose countries are also NATO members — and said that most of them supported Ukraine's position in the conflict. But he is frustrated that European powers in particular have refused to take preventive action against Russia, preferring to threaten a response in the event of Russian action. ""Since 2014, since the start of the war, I believe that basically Russia pushed Ukraine into NATO,"" he said. ""Basically I believe that today Russia itself is paving the difficult path of Ukraine to NATO."" He complained that, in his view, some EU members did not seem to have understood the extent of Ukraine's peril and urged them to act swiftly. On Wednesday, Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told Donfried that NATO should halt its eastward expansion and withdraw a promise that Ukraine could become a candidate for membership. A U.S. statement said Donfied would stress ""we can make diplomatic progress on ending the conflict in the Donbas through implementation of the Minsk agreements in support of the Normandy Format"". Ukraine and its closest supporters in the West want to cancel the opening of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will carry Russian gas supplies to Germany, by-passing Ukraine. Germany's new leader, Chancellor Olaf Scholz, has been cautious on this point, and some of the leaders meeting in Brussels fear pre-emptive sanctions will provoke rather than deter Russia. Getting Russia back to the negotiating table will not be easy. ""Moscow does not want to return to the Normandy format and wants to negotiate with the United States,"" a senior European diplomat told AFP. The diplomatic track was established at a summit in Minsk in 2015 where Putin accepted that France and Germany should play the role of moderators in the talks between the two belligerents. ""The Americans support a return to this format, and talks are underway with Moscow, but nothing has been agreed yet,"" the European envoy said.",1,623,96.12,61.05,14.12,5.6,24.92,28.57,78.81,54.9,44.78,6.1,3.05,0.32,0.64,0,0.96,0.8,3.05,13.32,8.51,0.96,17.01,4.65,1.61,5.14,1.28,10.75,3.69,1.77,7.87,2.57,0.32,4.98,9.15,0.48,8.67,1.28,1.77,2.09,0.64,0.32,2.25,0,4.33,1.28,3.05,1.12,0,1.12,0.32,0.64,0,0,15.25,8.83,1.93,0.32,1.77,0,4.17,6.74,0,0,0,0.96,6.26,4.98,1.28,0,3.05,0.16,0,2.73,0.16,0,0.16,0.16,0,0.16,0,0,0,0,0,0.32,0.64,0.48,0,0,0,0,1.61,0,2.41,8.67,0.32,1.77,7.06,0.16,0,0.16,2.57,4.33,2.41,1.12,0,0,0,0,0,16.37,4.98,4.65,0,0,1.77,4.98

Moscow is striving to complete what it began in 2014 in Crimea: to alter in its favor the terms on which the Cold War ended. The campaign began on Nov. 18, when President Vladimir Putin, speaking at a meeting of senior Foreign Ministry officials, called for “serious long-term guarantees that ensure Russia’s security.” On Dec. 1, at a ceremony for newly arrived foreign ambassadors, Putin was more specific. “While engaging in dialogue with the United States and its allies, we will insist on the elaboration of concrete agreements that would rule out any further eastward expansion of NATO and the deployment of weapons systems posing a threat to us in close proximity to Russia’s territory. We suggest that substantive talks on this topic should be started. I would like to note in particular that we need precisely legal, juridical guarantees, because our Western colleagues have failed to deliver on verbal commitments they made.” It would appear that Moscow began to review its “strategic patience” in relations with the West and Ukraine after NATO decided to grant Ukraine the status of Enhanced Opportunities Partner in June 2020. There was talk in Kiev of attaining the status of Major Non-NATO Ally, which would remove virtually all restrictions on military cooperation with the Americans. This, combined with Western sanctions against Russia, a lack of progress on implementing the Minsk agreements aimed at ending the conflict in eastern Ukraine, and the immobilization of Russian tools for influencing Ukrainian politics, was seen in Moscow as an alarming sign of Ukraine’s move into the Western security orbit. Even if the Minsk agreements are implemented in the way that Moscow would like, that still won’t enable Russia to achieve its strategic goals of keeping Ukraine in its own orbit of influence. Reintegrating the pro-Russian breakaway Donbass region into Ukraine’s political system won’t give Russia a veto right on Ukrainian foreign or defense policy. Kiev will still be able to marginalize the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk republics, just as President Volodymyr Zelenskiy managed to do with the pro-Russian oligarch Viktor Medvedchuk, his political party, and TV channels. Implementing the Minsk agreements may destabilize Ukraine in the short term, but Kiev will adapt rapidly, and then, NATO’s route into Ukraine — if not Ukraine’s into NATO — will be open. Moscow’s fixation on the Minsk agreements has prevented it from solving other problems in its relationship with Ukraine, and left Russia’s relationship with the West hostage to Kiev’s maneuvering. Now Moscow is seeking a way out of the impasse by trying to reach an agreement directly with the West that NATO will conclusively cease its expansion, which would force Ukraine to hammer out its relationship with Russia on Russia’s terms. To do this, Moscow needed to create a lever of influence on Western leaders that would prevent them from dismissing Russian concerns. That lever was provided by Russia’s increased military presence around Ukraine this year. The West believes the Russian leadership is now capable of conducting a limited military campaign against Ukraine that would force Kiev to accept terms once and for all for ending the conflict that has been simmering in the country’s east for nearly eight years now. Moscow used this demonstration of military strength to enter into direct discussion with the United States on its agenda. Along with promises that Ukraine won’t join NATO, Russia also wants guarantees that no NATO military infrastructure or facilities will appear on Ukrainian territory, even if it does not formally join the alliance. Moscow has made its demands public and is insisting that talks should begin as soon as possible. Putin’s call for legally binding agreements that NATO will not expand any further east has reduced its maneuvering room. It’s hard to imagine the alliance’s partners agreeing to any such thing, especially in a legally binding form, which would, in the United States, need to be ratified by the Senate. In any case, Moscow’s unrealistic demands — and their public announcement, when such sensitive issues are better discussed in private — have prompted suspicion in the West that they are simply a cover operation, and that the tight deadline issued by Moscow for starting talks indicates an imminent decision on a military operation. Nor has Moscow proposed any concessions of its own in exchange for the military and political limitations it would like to impose on NATO countries and Ukraine — other than repeating an old initiative for a moratorium on deploying short- and medium-range missiles in Europe. Still, we can assume that the military threat on Ukraine’s borders will prompt discussion within NATO of ceasing its expansion, especially if U.S. President Joe Biden (and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron) personally bring up the issue. In the United States, the possibility has been discussed at the level of experts. The question is how to formulate such a decision in a way that would suit both sides and would not require the North Atlantic Treaty to be amended. So is there a realistic format for a political undertaking not to expand NATO to Russia’s borders? There are two possible options. The first is to include a corresponding point in the 2022 NATO summit declaration in Madrid stating that the alliance will not expand any further to the east, and that this political declaration annuls all previous statements. That would allow NATO to disavow the declaration from the Bucharest summit in 2008, which promised that Ukraine and Georgia “will become members of NATO,” while preserving the open door policy enshrined in its founding treaty. Russia itself has already suggested something along these lines. The second option is an analogous point in NATO’s new strategic concept, which is planned to be adopted at the Madrid summit, or a combination of both of these formats. This would not provide legally binding guarantees: NATO’s strategic concept and its summit declarations are political documents and may be reviewed. But such a declaration at the top level would allow Russia to be reasonably confident that the bloc’s expansion would come to a halt. The political pledge made to Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990 that NATO would not expand its military infrastructure onto the territory of the former East Germany has never been broken. That is better than an unspoken promise not to accept Ukraine into NATO for another ten years. Diplomacy is the art of the possible, and this scenario, unlike others, is possible. The reaction of the NATO leadership has so far been sharply negative, but Biden has not yet spoken on the issue. It’s true that in any case, he doesn’t have a big enough majority in the Senate right now to get any legal guarantees of non-expansion ratified there. This is why the Iran nuclear deal was formatted as a political commitment, rather than a treaty obligation. Not to mention that within NATO, all thirty member states would have to ratify treaty obligations. Still, this should be the focus. An agreement to stop expanding NATO up to Russia’s border, regardless of its format, would be pivotal. It would open up the prospect of a different kind of relationship for Russia with the West and with Ukraine (as well as Georgia), while costing the NATO countries nothing but a change in rhetoric. Stopping NATO’s expansion would make it possible for Moscow and Kiev to hold direct talks on a conclusive resolution to the conflict based on the real state of affairs. If the two sides manage to reach an understanding on stopping NATO’s expansion to the east, then it should be possible to reach agreements fairly quickly on other “red lines” regarding Ukraine and also arms control. As in the late 1960s, direct interaction between Moscow and Washington could give a political framework to a future détente, within which agreements would become possible on European security. Still, escalation remains likely, due to unrealistic requirements being made under artificially short deadlines, as well as not enough emphasis on diplomacy — and too much on the military aspect.

The Baltic Sea pipeline is set to double supplies of cheap natural gas from Russia to Germany, which the European Union's top economy says is needed to help it transition from coal and nuclear energy. But the 10-billion-euro ($12 billion) project has for years been dogged by delays and drawn fierce criticism from Germany's eastern EU allies like Poland and from the United States. Critics say the project will increase Europe's dependence on Russian gas and Ukraine has described it as a ""geopolitical weapon."" ""Any new military action cannot remain without severe consequences,"" the Green minister told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, a Sunday weekly, referring to a Russian troop deployment on the Ukraine border. He warned that ""nothing can be excluded"" if ""there is a new violation of the territorial integrity"" of Ukraine. The new German government threatened to block the pipeline from operating if Russia invades Ukraine. ""In the event of further escalation this gas pipeline could not come into service,"" Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said. Habeck said: ""From a geopolitical point of view, the pipeline is a mistake,"" adding: ""All the countries were against it except Germany and Austria."" He added: ""The pipeline has however been built. And the question of it being put into service remains open and must be decided according to European and German law."" German authorities are waiting for the pipeline's Swiss-based ""Nord Stream 2 AG"" operating company to submit documents to restart the certification process. The pipeline would then also have to be approved by the European Commission — a process not likely to be completed in the first half of next year.

After a 50 minute phone call — their second in just over three weeks — both presidents indicated support for further diplomacy on the tense standoff between Russia and Western-backed Ukraine. Putin was ""pleased"" overall with the talks, foreign policy adviser Yury Ushakov told reporters. A senior US official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the tone ""was serious and substantive."" But there was no disguising the depth of disagreement — or the dangerously high stakes on the fringes of eastern Europe — ahead of in-person negotiations between high-ranking Russian and U.S. officials on Jan. 10. Biden ""made clear that the United States and its allies and partners will respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine,"" Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement. Ushakov, referring to Washington's repeated threats of economic sanctions as a response to a Ukraine attack, said this would be ""a colossal mistake. We hope this will not happen."" Ushakov also said that Russia is looking for a concrete ""result"" in the January talks in Geneva, while the White House said it, too, wanted action — de-escalation by Russia's massive military presence on the Ukrainian border. ""President Biden reiterated that substantive progress in these dialogues can occur only in an environment of de-escalation rather than escalation,"" Psaki said. Washington and its European allies accuse Russia of threatening former Soviet territory Ukraine with a new invasion. Some 100,000 Russian troops are massed near the border of the country, where Putin already seized the Crimea region in 2014 and is accused of fomenting a pro-Russian separatist war which erupted that same year in the east. Moscow describes the troop presence as protection against expansion of NATO, although Ukraine has not been offered membership in the military alliance. Earlier this month, the Russians issued a sweeping set of demands, including guarantees that NATO not expand and a bar on new U.S. military bases in former territories of the Soviet Union. The United States rejects what it calls a bid by the Moscow to dictate independent countries' futures. In a readout after the call, the Kremlin stressed that Biden told Putin that U.S. offensive weapons would not be deployed in Ukraine. The White House, however, said Biden merely reaffirmed existing policy. ""President Biden made clear that the U.S. is continuing to provide defensive security assistance to Ukraine and is not introducing offensive strike weapons. This was not a new commitment,"" a U.S. official told AFP. And U.S. officials repeated warnings of blistering economic sanctions backed both by Washington and EU capitals if Russia does attack Ukraine further. Biden ""laid out two paths,"" a senior administration official said. ""One is a path of diplomacy... and the other path is more focused on deterrence, including serious costs."" The January talks will see Russian officials sitting down separately with negotiators representing the United States, NATO and the regional OSCE security forum, which also includes the United States. Russia's delegation will be led by Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, and the U.S. delegation by Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman. Ukraine, which wants to join NATO but has been told it is far from being ready to win acceptance, is eager not to be cut out of any wider deal. US officials have been at pains to insist that no decision will be taken behind the Ukrainians' backs and that while US troops would not be sent to defend the country against Russia, ongoing deliveries of weapons and other military assistance are set to expand if Moscow attacks.",1,613,91.02,30.96,39.4,7.18,21.89,30.83,82.06,56.28,43.23,5.22,1.31,0,0.82,0,0.16,0.16,3.92,14.03,8.65,1.31,13.21,6.36,1.96,5.55,1.63,12.4,6.69,2.45,9.79,2.61,0.49,6.85,9.79,0.33,9.46,0.33,1.14,1.63,1.14,0.33,4.89,0,5.06,1.79,3.26,0.98,0.33,0.65,0.16,0.33,0,0,12.72,8.81,1.31,0,1.96,0.65,5.06,4.08,0,0,0,0.16,8.65,7.01,1.47,0.16,3.43,0,0.49,2.45,0.49,0,0.33,0.33,0.33,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.49,0.49,0,0,0,0.33,1.47,0.33,2.12,11.09,0.98,0.65,8.65,0.82,0,0.33,3.92,5.87,3.43,1.79,0,0,0,0,0,16.97,7.18,4.57,0,0,0.82,4.4

Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko’s comments follow NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg’s offer of “meaningful dialogue” with Moscow in exchange for “aggressor” Russia standing down troops near Ukraine. “We haven’t received any concrete serious proposals from NATO. All our previously made proposals on de-escalation remained unanswered,” Grushko said in comments to the state-run RIA Novosti news agency. Russia’s Foreign Ministry this week handed a list of security demands to visiting U.S. Assistant State Secretary Karen Donfried, who then traveled to NATO headquarters in Brussels to discuss them with Stoltenberg. President Vladimir Putin this week requested to “immediately launch negotiations” with the U.S. and NATO. Putin seeks international legal guarantees for Russia’s security before he withdraws his troops, which the U.S. warns signals Russia’s imminent invasion of Ukraine. Grushko’s colleague Sergei Ryabkov previously warned that Russia could act militarily if the talks it demands with the U.S. and NATO do not materialize. Stoltenberg also stressed during a joint press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that NATO would not yield to Russia’s demands to prevent Ukraine’s efforts to join NATO and the bloc’s right to defend its allies. The U.S. and the European Union threatened “massive” sanctions against Moscow in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine. Putin denies planning an invasion and instead blames NATO for the rise in tensions, including through U.S.-led military exercises in the Black Sea.

President Vladimir Putin said earlier Thursday that Russia “must react” to what he alleged are Ukrainian plans to attack the pro-Moscow territories in eastern Ukraine known as the Donbass. Putin’s claims follow weeks of Western warnings that Russia could invade Ukraine as early as January. The independent Meduza news website reported earlier this week that recruiters in Russia had started gathering groups of mercenaries for a ""combat mission"" in Donbass, but that the scope of their work was unknown. According to Reuters, recruited Russian mercenaries are undergoing special training for defensive and sabotage purposes in the Donbass. “They are gathering everybody with combat experience,” the news agency quoted one of the recruited mercenaries as saying. The fighters said they were unaware of Russian attack plans or preparations, Reuters reported. One of the unnamed mercenaries reportedly said he was planning to join fellow fighters on the Russian side of the border with Ukraine’s separatist-controlled Luhansk region. Separatist leaders said they were either unaware of or not involved in the latest recruitment drive, Reuters reported. The Kremlin, which maintains that any Russian nationals on the ground are there voluntarily, denied official links with Russian private military contractors in eastern Ukraine. “It's the first we've heard of this and we don't know how reliable these assertions are,” Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying. The reports follow Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu’s claims that U.S. private military companies have stationed troops in eastern Ukraine for “provocations with unidentified chemical components.” At the same time, Russia and the United States have signaled readiness to launch talks over Moscow’s sweeping security demands as soon as early January. Faced with accusations of massing tens of thousands troops near Ukraine's border, Russia last week sent a draft list of its demands to the U.S., which among others includes a call to block Ukraine from future NATO membership.

Although any new Russian invasion could be devastating, they must prepare for the possibility. The Brezhnev-era Kremlin underestimated the West. In the late 1970s, the USSR began deploying SS-20 theater-range ballistic missiles aimed at Europe and Japan. Despite Moscow’s fierce campaign of propaganda, disinformation, and intimidation, NATO responded by deploying in Europe missiles of comparable range. Having failed to scare NATO into submission, hidebound Soviet leaders lost face. Then a liberalizing leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, came to power and agreed with President Ronald Reagan to ban both sides’ missiles. Soviet leaders in the “era of stagnation” may have believed their own false propaganda that the West was weak and disunited.  Today’s Kremlin may be making the same mistake. On December 17, Moscow publicized proposed demands which would in effect require the U.S. to withdraw from Europe and NATO to collapse. Only a day later, the Kremlin said it might “up the ante.” Nonetheless, on December 21 U.S. national security advisor Jake Sullivan said the U.S. was ready for talks in “full coordination with our European allies and partners.” In his December 23 press conference, Putin said he had “so far seen a positive reaction” to Moscow's proposals, but satellite photos show that in mid-December Russia was still deploying more tanks, short-range ballistic missiles, and other arms near Ukraine. Russia’s demands would force the U.S. to remove its nuclear weapons from Europe and forego deployment of theater-range missiles, even though such weapons could be deployed in European Russia. Proposed accords would ban NATO from admitting any “former Soviet republic” even though NATO has rejected such a ban. They would require that NATO withdraw infrastructure in its eastern members, but the heightened Russian threat to Ukraine may spur NATO to do the opposite. Evidently anxious about popular uprisings against its rule, the Kremlin also demands a ban on “actions aimed at changing the political or social order.” ""The Kremlin knows how to negotiate constructively, as it did successfully when it achieved the New START Treaty and the Iran nuclear agreement. On December 21, President Vladimir Putin hinted that the purpose of the new unrealistic demands was to help create a justification for war: “If our Western counterparts continue a clearly aggressive line, we will undertake proportionate military-technical countermeasures.” Thus, NATO might be wise to consider that Russia could launch a wider invasion of Ukraine. Wars always bring uncertainties, but several considerations could be relevant. First, any attempt to seize a large area east of the Dnipro River, including such cities as Karkhiv, Dnipro, and Odessa, and possibly Kyiv, would pose a major military operational challenge and take time. Looking at a notional scenario of an invasion by 130,000 Russian troops, RAND found that the operation would take “weeks, if not months, to fully develop and execute.” And an invasion could meet resistance and incur heavy casualties. Second, in 2014 Russian invaders faced a disorganized but determined Ukrainian opposition, but this time they would confront a better trained, armed, and motivated fighting force. Even a Russian “shock and awe” assault – mass cyber and electronic attacks, and a multi-front combined arms operation – might not easily carry the day. Ukraine’s defenses could be stressed but still slow invaders. Many Ukrainian commanders and soldiers are battle-hardened from the seven-year war in the Donbas. To reduce risks from drone attacks, some Ukrainian forces could disperse in small squads on ATVs or other mobile platforms. Equipped with precision-guided mortars, guided anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, and loitering munitions, mobile forces could frustrate some Russian battle plans. Third, if Ukraine were at risk of being overrun or if adjacent NATO allies were threatened, NATO might intervene. As in the 1973 Yom Kippur War when Israel was threatened with potential defeat, the U.S. could airlift military aid. Washington has not provided Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, which could down Russian helicopters and low-flying fixed wing aircraft, but in an extreme scenario it might do so. Although Biden says that providing U.S. troops is “not on the table,” in compelling circumstances NATO could unleash formidable air and naval power. Fourth, the Kremlin might be tempted think that fears of a widened war or of attacks by cyber weapons, long-range precision guided missiles, or even limited use of non-strategic nuclear forces would deter NATO from intervening militarily. These concerns might be a factor, but the Alliance has prepared to respond to aggression with its own tools of coercion. For example, it could mount cyber assaults that disrupt Russia’s economy and financial system and military logistics for its fighters in Ukraine. Fifth, Ukraine could mount a longer-term insurgency against Russian occupiers, which might be stretched thin or rely partly on ill-trained conscripts.  On December 19, The Washington Post said the Biden administration was exploring ways to aid guerillas. An insurgency might be sustainable if Ukraine west of the Dnipro River or if an adjacent NATO member state were to be a sanctuary and source of resupply. At the same time, Russian reactions to armed resistance could be “swift, direct, and brutal.” The Kremlin may err if it thinks Ukraine or NATO would easily submit to aggression. The hour is late, but Kremlin leaders might consider instead seeking a stable European security architecture that protects Russia’s interests while also allowing for a vibrant and sovereign Ukraine.

Mercenaries Preparing Donbass  Provocation  Russian Defense Chief,English,Russia,"Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu claimed on Tuesday that U.S. private military companies have stationed troops in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine and are preparing a “provocation using unknown chemical components.” Shoigu’s statements came during a Defense Ministry meeting in Moscow amid growing fears that Russia could launch an invasion of Ukraine. “We have identified the presence of over 120 members of U.S. mercenary groups in the cities of Avdiivka and Krasny Liman to commit provocations…Tanks filled with unidentified chemical components were delivered to the cities of Avdeevka and Krasny Liman to commit provocations,” the state-run TASS news agency quoted Shoigu as saying. Shoigu, considered a trusted ally of Vladimir Putin, also slammed the U.S. for increased tensions near Russia’s border. “The United States is building up its military presence at Russian borders. In the countries of Eastern Europe, American units with a total number of about 8,000 servicemen are deployed on a rotational basis,” he said. Shoigu further boasted of Russia’s improved military, saying that the country’s army was a “world leader” in terms of its modernity. Around 100,000 Russian troops are currently believed to be stationed on the border with Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied plotting an invasion into Ukraine, saying it is in its right to move troops within its borders.

The call comes after Moscow earlier this month presented Western capitals with sweeping security demands, saying NATO must not admit new members and seeking to bar the United States from opening new bases in ex-Soviet countries. The call, which will begin at 20:30 GMT, also comes ahead of talks between representatives of the two rivals in Geneva in January, with Washington saying it expects to discuss the Ukraine conflict and Moscow insisting its security demands be contended with. Biden, who is at his home in Delaware for the New Year's holiday, will stress in his call with Putin that Washington is looking for a ""diplomatic path"" out of the crisis, a senior administration official told reporters. ""But we are also prepared to respond if Russia advances with a further invasion of Ukraine,"" Biden will tell Putin, the official said, adding that Washington remained ""gravely concerned"" about the military build-up and wanted to see the Russian forces return ""to their regular training areas."" In a holiday message to Biden hours before the call, Putin said he is ""convinced"" that ""we can move forward and establish an effective Russian-American dialogue based on mutual respect and consideration of each other's national interests."" His spokesman Dmitry Peskov then told reporters that Moscow is ""in the mood for a conversation."" ""We believe that only through talks is it possible to solve all the immediate problems that we have in abundance between us,"" Peskov said, adding that the call was Putin's initiative. The call will be the second in less than a month between the two leaders, with Biden in early December warning Putin of ""severe consequences"" if Russian troops invaded Ukraine. Washington has led the charge in raising the alarm over Russian troop movements near its ex-Soviet neighbor Ukraine, where the West says Moscow has massed around 100,000 forces ahead of a possible winter invasion. Putin has denied the allegation and accused the West of stoking tensions, saying that NATO's eastward expansion is a threat to Russian security. Ukraine, which has since 2014 fought a pro-Russia insurgency in its east that has claimed over 13,000 lives, has repeatedly said it wants to join the U.S.-led security alliance. But Russia considers ex-Soviet states to be within its sphere of influence, and has grown increasingly insistent that the only way out of the crisis is the West accepting its demands that would redraw Europe's security architecture. At the talks in Geneva next month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has vowed that Moscow will take a ""hard line"" aimed at avoiding concessions. His ministry on Thursday said that delegations for the talks will be led by Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman. The United States has called some of the Russian positions non-starters, but said it is willing to talk and will also bring up its own concerns. Ahead of the U.S.-Russia talks, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke by telephone on Wednesday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. ""I was assured of full U.S. support for Ukraine in countering Russian aggression,"" Zelenskiy tweeted afterward. Blinken also spoke separately to his counterparts from Britain, France and Germany on ""coordination to deter any further Russian aggression against Ukraine"", State Department spokesman Ned Price said. The Biden administration has vowed to take all actions in lockstep with its European allies. Following the Geneva talks, Russian delegates will meet with delegates of the NATO alliance ahead of a meeting of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, a key Cold War forum that brings together Moscow and the West. ""We will determine further steps depending on the readiness of the United States and NATO for substantive talks regarding our concerns,"" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters on Thursday.",1,661,95,66.71,35.25,15.18,30.05,30.56,83.06,58.7,42.51,6.96,2.72,0.15,1.06,0,1.06,0.3,4.24,14.07,8.02,1.21,15.89,5.75,1.66,4.24,0.15,15.13,5.9,2.72,8.02,2.42,1.06,4.69,7.56,0.61,6.96,1.51,1.66,0.91,0.91,0.15,1.66,0,4.39,1.82,2.27,0.76,0,0.45,0.15,0.3,0,0,15.58,11.04,0.76,0.45,1.36,0.15,7.26,5.45,0,0,0.15,1.36,6.96,4.54,2.12,0.3,3.93,0.3,0.45,3.03,0.15,0,0.15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.61,0.3,0.45,0,0.3,0,0,1.82,0.45,2.72,11.2,0.91,1.21,8.62,0.61,0,0.61,4.84,4.08,5.14,2.72,0.15,0.15,0,0,0,16.04,5.14,4.54,0,0,0.76,5.6

",English,Russia,"One of the most asked questions in recent weeks has been whether Russia will attack Ukraine, despite a slight lessening of tensions in the wake of last week’s video call between the Russian and U.S. presidents. But how would ordinary Russians respond to a war with neighboring Ukraine? Our 2015 research — “Do Russians Want War?” — showed that there is little enthusiasm for a “real,” large-scale war among members of Russia’s modern, urban society (the country’s military operations in Syria and eastern Ukraine in recent years were not seen as real wars). The military action in Donbas in 2014, which took place against the backdrop of the triumphal seizure of Crimea, was viewed very positively by the Russian public. As soon as it became clear that Donbas was a different form of operation to Crimea, however (far bloodier and more destructive), public opinion went on the defensive: “Russia has nothing to do with it, the United States and Ukraine are to blame for all the loss of life, and there’s no real war under way in any case.” A very similar sentiment dominates today: a recent survey showed that 50 percent of respondents blame the United States and NATO for the worsening situation in Ukraine (16 percent blame Ukraine itself). Only 4 percent consider Russia to be responsible for escalating tensions. For a few years, the unprecedented patriotic surge of 2014 served as symbolic compensation for the socioeconomic problems that had already begun. Russians lapped up the real and imaginary threats that were fed to them, and generally assessed military action as justified, defensive, and/or preventative. These wars took place in the background: TV reports did not dwell on the brutal and bloody reality of armed conflict. At the same time, the militarization of official rhetoric and the growing authority of the army — which overtook the presidency in a list of most trusted institutions in 2020 — strengthened the so-called “Crimea consensus.” The sociological parameters began to change in 2018, however, with the dissipation of the rallying-around-the-flag effect. If in 2014 26 percent of respondents said that “Russia was surrounded by enemies on all sides,” then that opinion was shared by just 16 percent in 2020. The number of Russians who believed it was futile to look for enemies because “the root of the evil was Russia’s own mistakes” rose from 17 percent to 25 percent in the same period. The Crimea consensus and the symbolic might of state institutions remained, but they lost their power to mobilize. War started to frighten people. The average Russian is tired of self-deception and of persuading themselves that if a war does happen, it will not impact their lives or those of family members. Russian conformists are, of course, traditionally bellicose people, but theirs is the bellicosity of propaganda television talk shows, or the language of online hate. No conformists want a large-scale war: conscription is not part of the social contract, particularly at a time of accelerating inflation and economic stagnation. State propaganda has overused its powers of mobilization. Instead of mobilization, it has created a fear of world war. At the end of 2018, 56 percent of respondents to a Levada Center survey said there was a significant military threat from other countries. This year, the fear of a world war has increased dramatically, reaching a solid second place in a Levada Center list of the top issues causing Russians to worry. The other fears that have risen in parallel with that of war are those of an increasingly harsh political regime, mass repression, and arbitrary rule: the authoritarianization of the Russian political regime has not gone unnoticed. It’s symptomatic that the worsening of the public mood has gone hand in hand with a fall or stagnation in the approval ratings of the president and the authorities overall. The year 2018 was a pivotal moment in this process. To a large extent, it was the move to raise the retirement age that destroyed the classic Putin-era social contract: “you provide for us and leave our Soviet-style social handouts alone, and we’ll vote for you and take no interest in your stealing and bribe-taking.” A high level of support for Putin in the 2018 presidential elections was mistakenly interpreted by the authorities as real political credit, rather than indifference and mostly symbolic trust. The pandemic has only confirmed this bifurcation in attitudes toward the authorities: we support the symbols — the flag, the national anthem, and Putin as a representation of our geopolitical might — but we don’t trust specific initiatives and the actions of government at various political levels. This sort of mute dissatisfaction was visible during the 2021 parliamentary elections, when people voted for the Communist Party as an abstract alternative to the current authorities. There is one final aspect to this problem. When people talk about a war, they mostly mean a conflict with Ukraine (even if it would involve NATO, the United States, and the West). Of course, if war breaks out, state propaganda will convince most Russians that it’s necessary, and that we are, in fact, “liberating” our Ukrainian brethren from an alien government (even if Ukrainians chose that government themselves in free elections). This will all take place despite the fact that in 2021, 23 percent of Russians believed Russia and Ukraine should be friendly neighbors but still have their own borders: only 17 percent of respondents supported a unification of the two states. War is the business of young people and conscripts. But 66 percent of Russians aged between 18 and 24 have a positive or very positive attitude toward Ukraine. That’s despite a backdrop of unceasing vitriol directed toward Ukraine on state television, and the persistent, oft-repeated idea that it is external attacks that require Russia to take defensive measures. To put it simply, before launching an offensive, it’s worth thinking about who will fight in that offensive and how willingly, and to what extent an active conflict will prompt people to rally around Putin. The evidence suggests that even in the best-case scenario, the mobilization effect will be nonexistent.

A district court in Russia’s Rostov region located on the Ukrainian border disclosed that a convicted senior manager was in charge of buying, stocking and selling food to Russian troops stationed in eastern Ukraine. “This food was intended to be sent to military units of the Russian Armed Forces stationed on the territory of the DNR and LNR,” the court said in its verdict. The ruling was no longer visible on the court's website as of Thursday afternoon. Moscow denies the presence of Russian Armed Forces soldiers in the Donbass, the rebel-held region which has been locked in a protracted war with Ukrainian forces since 2014. It has maintained that any Russian nationals fighting in the conflict-torn region were there on a voluntary basis and not in any official capacity. Western countries accuse Russia of providing troops, equipment and funding to the separatists and have sanctioned Moscow over its role in the conflict. The Kremlin on Thursday called the November verdict's information on Russian troops a “mistake,” reiterating the official line that Russian troops are not stationed in eastern Ukraine. DNR and LNR refer to the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk “people’s republics” in eastern Ukraine. The U.S. RFE/RL news organization estimated that the bi-weekly supplies of 1,300 tons of products mentioned in the court documents would feed around 26,000 Russian troops. The defendant, identified as V.N. Zabaluev, deputy regional manager for military nutrition of the local company “Tekhnologiya,” admitted to have bribed officials up to four times in 2019. RFE/RL’s Russian bureau Svoboda reported, citing the verdict, that there may be other companies engaged in supplying Russian troops in eastern Ukraine with food. The court sentenced Zabaluev to five years in prison on charges of transferring 990,000 rubles ($13,500) from his boss to a military epidemiological official to gain favor with the authorities and avoid disruptions in the supply chain.",1,331,99,49.04,43.51,5.38,23.64,34.14,78.25,48.94,41.09,3.32,0.3,0,0,0,0.3,0,3.02,14.8,10.27,2.42,17.22,4.83,0.91,3.32,0.91,7.25,4.23,1.81,9.67,2.11,0.3,7.25,7.25,0.3,6.95,1.51,1.21,0.6,1.51,0,1.81,0,2.42,0.3,2.11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.46,3.93,0.3,0,0.91,0.6,1.51,4.23,0,0,0,0.3,7.25,3.02,3.93,0.3,5.44,0,0,3.93,1.51,0,1.51,0.3,0,0.3,0,0,0,1.51,0,0,0,0.6,0,0,0,0.3,0.3,0,1.21,13.29,0,0,12.69,0.6,0,0,2.11,2.72,1.21,0.6,0,0,0,0,0,16.62,5.14,4.23,0,0,1.81,5.44

Weeks of Russian military buildup near the Ukrainian border have raised alarm in the West that Russia might invade Ukraine as early as January. Moscow, meanwhile, blames NATO for provocations and threatening its security. Russia has repeatedly said it wants a legally binding guarantee that Ukraine will never join NATO and that the alliance will halt its expansion toward Russian borders. In the list of demands published on the Russian Foreign Ministry website on Friday, Moscow asks NATO to abandon all military activities not just in Ukraine, but also Eastern Europe, the Caucasus region and Central Asia. Russia also asks the U.S. not to establish any new military bases on the territory of former Soviet states and for NATO to guarantee that it will block future membership for any former Soviet republic. Russia demands that NATO pledge not to deploy troops to Eastern Europe without Russian consent, with the alliance prohibited from increasing troop numbers past those of 1997, before NATO expanded into Eastern Europe. The proposal would de facto ban NATO from deploying forces in former-communist member states including Poland, the Czech Republic and the Baltics. Another point seeks to reaffirm that Moscow and the U.S.-led alliance “do not consider each other adversaries” and that the two will “resolve all disputes peacefully and refrain from the use of force.” Russia’s Foreign Ministry handed the list to visiting U.S. diplomat Karen Donfried this week and President Vladimir Putin reiterated his demand that talks between the U.S.and NATO on international legal guarantees for Russia’s security begin “immediately.” Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told journalists in Moscow on Friday that Russia was ""ready"" as early as Saturday to begin security talks with the U.S. He also said Moscow was “extremely disappointed” by signals coming from the West regarding Russia’s proposals on security guarantees. Meanwhile, the U.S. said it wouldn’t negotiate without input from Europe. ""We've managed to engage Russia over strategic concerns for decades,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said. ""There's no reason we can't do that moving forward to reduce instability, but we're going to do that in partnership and coordination with our European allies and partners.” A senior official on Friday told reporters that the United States was willing to discuss security proposals put forward by Russia but disagreed with parts of them. ""We are prepared to discuss them. That said, there are some things in this document that the Russians know will be unacceptable,"" the official told reporters on condition of anonymity. The EU on Thursday rejected Russia’s bid to block Kiev’s NATO ambitions and repeated that it will impose ""massive consequences and severe costs"" on Russia if the country decides to invade Ukraine. Earlier this week, Ryabkov warned that Russia will respond “militarily”  if the Western military bloc does not guarantee an end to its eastward expansion. The sweeping demands will have great consequences for the balance of power on the European continent and experts said the West was unlikely to accept the terms presented by Russia. “The demands from Moscow appear to make any negotiation much more difficult. Seeking limits on NATO deployments and exercises on the territory of NATO member states is likely to be a non-starter in Washington,” Matthew Rojansky, director of the Wilson Center's Kennan Institute in Washington, told The Moscow Times. “The Kremlin cannot have a realistic expectation it will get legally binding commitments of this nature from NATO, but that may not be the point — rather it may be to shape negotiations in the shadow of a looming military threat to Ukraine and, by extension, to Europe,” Rojansky added. Rojansky pointed out that the message from the West to Russia has also been clear, that any further “aggression against Ukraine or any other state will not be tolerated, and will be met with an unprecedented response.” “In sum, these will be difficult but still vitally important negotiations.” Russia-based experts also doubted the West was likely to accept the latest demands. “Publication of Russian proposed agreements with U.S. and NATO on [European security] may suggest that Moscow (rightly) considers their acceptance by the West unlikely,” Dmitry Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, tweeted shortly after Russia published the demands. Trenin added that Russia “will have to assure its security single-handedly, most probably by military-technical means.” Andrei Kortunov, head of the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC), a Kremlin-aligned think tank, said that the Kremlin likely doesn't expect the West to accept its demands. “This is a bargaining position — [the Kremlin] is trying to get some degree of partial acceptance. Of course, there is a real risk to making these sorts of demands, especially if the West takes a harsh position, but clearly, the Kremlin thinks that the risk is justified in the circumstances,” Kortunov told The Moscow Times.

European gas prices rocketed Tuesday to all-time highs on strong winter demand and simmering geopolitical tensions between key supplier Russia and consumer nations. Europe's reference Dutch TTF gas price jumped nearly 20 percent from Monday to hit 175.00 euros per megawatt hour in early afternoon trading. ""Gazprom's actions are anti-competitive and have significant negative consequences for all European consumers,"" Yuriy Vitrenko, head of Ukraine's state energy company Naftogaz, said in a statement. ""Gazprom sharply reduced its delivery of natural gas to the European spot market, despite growing market demand,"" Vitrenko added. He also accused Gazprom of preventing other companies from supplying additional gas to Europe. Naftogaz said that Gazprom seeks to ""create an artificial deficit of gas to pressure the European Union into securing the rapid commissioning of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline."" The Ukrainian company said it filed a complaint with the European Commission against Gazprom ""abusing its dominant position on the European gas market."" The Nord Stream 2 pipeline via the Baltic Sea is set to double supplies of cheap natural gas from Russia to Germany, which the European Union's top economy says is needed to help it transition from coal and nuclear energy. But critics say Nord Stream 2 will increase Europe's dependence on Russian gas and Ukraine has described the pipeline, which bypasses its territory and deprives it of transit fees, as a ""geopolitical weapon"".

Shipments through the Yamal pipeline — which runs through Belarus and Poland to Germany — were at their lowest for at least a month over the weekend, Interfax reported, citing market data. Daily shipments fell from 27 million cubic meters (mcm) Friday to 5.2 mcm and 4.7 mcm on Saturday and Sunday, respectively. Gazprom also booked only minimal additional capacity on the transit route Monday — 3.8 mcm — worrying markets as gas prices rose across Europe once more. Gas prices climbed above $1,700 per thousand cubic meters on Monday — 70% higher than the levels seen in September when politicians across the continent first started worrying about a possible Russian squeeze on supplies ahead of the winter. The Yamal pipeline operates at a full capacity of 89 mcm per day, meaning flows were operating at only 4% of capacity Monday. Russia and Gazprom have previously been accused of trying to squeeze the European gas market to advance its Nord Stream 2 project and push European countries to sign long-term gas deals with Gazprom that guarantee supplies at fixed prices. The company increased supplies to Europe in the second half of November and early December, though prices have remained elevated given low storage levels in Europe, fears of conflict in Ukraine and new delays to Nord Stream 2’s certification. The Yamal pipeline is one of Gazprom’s major supply routes into the continent, in addition to the first Nord Stream pipeline and transit through Ukraine. Nord Stream is operating at full capacity and Russia has been reluctant to book additional capacity on the Ukrainian route in recent months. In auctions held Monday for January transit supply, Gazprom rejected an option to book extra supplies through Ukraine for a fourth consecutive month and booked only 22% of proposed extra supplies on the Yamal route, the state-run TASS news agency reported.",1,329,99,33.19,78.63,6.88,29.91,30.4,76.6,53.8,38.6,1.52,0.3,0,0,0,0,0.3,1.22,11.55,7.29,5.78,18.84,2.74,2.74,4.86,0,7.6,7.9,10.33,1.82,0,0.91,0.91,4.26,0,4.26,0.3,0,0.3,0.61,0.3,1.52,0,2.13,0.3,1.82,0.91,0,0.91,0.91,0,0,0,2.13,1.52,0,0,0.91,0.3,0.3,0.3,0,0,0,0,1.52,0.3,1.22,0,9.42,0.61,0,6.08,2.74,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.22,0,0,0.3,0,1.22,12.16,0,1.52,10.33,0.3,0,0.61,9.12,3.34,1.52,0.91,0,0,0,0,0,11.55,4.26,3.34,0,0,0.91,3.04

The defense ministry said in a statement that the drills for Southern Military District forces had taken place in a host of southern regions including Rostov, Krasnodar and Crimea, which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014. But the drills also took place further afield, including in Stavropol, Astrakhan, North Caucasus republics and even in Russia's Caucasus ally Armenia. The defense ministry said the troops were returning to their permanent bases and that stand-by units would be readied for the New Year's holidays. Western countries have accused Russia of massing upwards of 100,000 troops near Ukraine ahead of a possible winter invasion. According to Kiev's estimates, the number of Russian troops along Ukraine's borders has increased from around 93,000 troops in October to 104,000 now. Russia says it is free to move its forces on its territory how it sees fit and denies that it is planning a large-scale attack. It has presented the West with sweeping security demands, saying NATO must not admit new members and seeking to bar the United States from establishing new bases in former Soviet republics. Tensions reached a boiling point on Wednesday when President Vladimir Putin said Russia would take ""appropriate retaliatory"" military steps in response to what he called the West's ""aggressive stance"". But he lowered the volume the next day, saying he had seen a ""positive"" reaction from the United States to Russia's security proposals and said talks would take place next month. In an interview on Friday, a senior Ukrainian security official told AFP that there is no risk of an imminent Russian invasion.

The West has for weeks raised alarm over Russian military buildup near Ukraine and fears of a Russian invasion of its ally. Moscow denies planning an invasion into Ukraine and accuses U.S.-led NATO of threatening its security by expanding its presence near Russian borders. “If our Western colleagues continue the obviously aggressive stance, we will take appropriate retaliatory military-technical measures and react harshly to unfriendly steps,” Putin said at a Defense Ministry board meeting, according to the state-run TASS news agency. He did not specify which “military-technical” measures would be taken. The Russian president stressed that Moscow “doesn't want armed conflicts or bloodshed” and that it “has every right” to take what he views as steps that ensure the country’s security and sovereignty. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, meanwhile, said the U.S. has “expressed readiness” to launch dialogue with Russia on its proposed security guarantees that seek to limit NATO's eastward expansion. But Putin stressed that Moscow will only accept “long-term, legally binding guarantees” with Washington, accusing the U.S. of withdrawing from international treaties “that for one reason or another become uninteresting to them.” Russia last week sent the U.S. a list of sweeping demands that seek guarantees for NATO to abandon its military activities in Eastern Europe and Central Asia; to block future NATO membership for any post-Soviet country; and for the U.S. not to establish any new military bases on the territory of former Soviet states. The U.S. and European Union have issued repeated warnings to Russia that any military action in Ukraine would be met with sanctions far worse than those it levied in 2014, when Moscow annexed Crimea from Kiev and conflict broke out between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. Following Putin's comments, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance will “not compromise” on Ukraine's right to “choose its own path” and seek NATO membership. Also at Tuesday's Defense Ministry meeting, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu claimed that U.S. private military companies have stationed troops in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine and are preparing a “provocation using unknown chemical components.”",1,381,90.23,41.62,46.12,1,31.75,36.22,80.31,50.13,38.58,7.09,1.31,0,0.52,0,0.52,0.26,5.77,11.55,5.51,0.52,14.17,3.94,1.57,5.51,1.05,8.14,7.09,1.57,9.71,2.1,0.26,7.35,9.19,0.26,8.92,1.31,1.57,0.79,1.84,1.05,3.15,0,5.77,1.05,4.72,1.31,0,1.31,0.79,0.26,0,0,9.97,6.3,0.79,0,2.1,0.52,2.36,3.94,0,0.26,0,0.52,9.71,7.87,1.84,0,1.57,0,0.26,1.31,0,0,0.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.26,0,0.26,1.05,0,0,0.26,0,1.84,0,2.36,13.12,1.84,1.84,8.66,0.26,0,0.26,3.94,2.62,1.84,1.84,0.26,0.26,0,0,0,19.95,6.82,2.89,0,0,1.84,8.4

Four suspects are being tried in absentia for launching a BUK missile that hit flight MH17 over war-torn eastern Ukraine in 2014, killing all 298 people on board. Prosecutors launched closing arguments in the trial Monday, saying the four suspects played pivotal roles in securing the BUK system, which was most likely intended to strike a Ukrainian war plane. ""If this was the intention, that doesn't change the accusation of making it a criminal act,"" public prosecutor Thijs Berger told the judges. ""A mistake in target also makes no difference to the evidence that such a crime has been committed."" The suspects ""used a BUK missile as a tool to serve their own military interest and hit MH17 with it,"" he added. International investigators say the BUK missile was originally brought from a Russian military base, ostensibly to be used in the fight against Ukrainian forces. Berger said the men on trial ""did not press the button themselves, but... used it for their armed struggle with the aim of destroying an aircraft."" The four suspects on trial are Russian nationals Igor Girkin, Sergei Dubinsky and Oleg Pulatov, and Ukrainian citizen Leonid Kharchenko. All four have refused to appear in court in the Netherlands and are being tried in absentia. In three days of hearings this week, the prosecution are formally charging the four suspects and will set out their sentencing demands. A verdict at the high-security court, near Amsterdam's Schiphol airport where MH17 took off on its doomed flight to Kuala Lumpur, is not expected until late 2022 at the earliest. ""The maximum penalty is life imprisonment,"" a court spokesperson told AFP. The hearings come as fresh tensions soar over Ukraine, with the West accusing Moscow of planning an invasion. Girkin, 49, also known by his pseudonym ""Strelkov,"" is the most high-profile suspect — a former Russian spy and historical re-enactment fan who helped kickstart the war in Ukraine. Dubinsky, 57, who has also been linked with Russian intelligence, allegedly served as the separatists' military intelligence chief. Pulatov, 53, was an ex-Russian special forces soldier and one of Dubinsky's deputies. Kharchenko, 48, allegedly led a separatist unit in eastern Ukraine. Pulatov is the only suspect to be represented by lawyers. Prosecutors will spend Monday and Tuesday explaining evidence including telephone and electronic eavesdropping, the circumstances surrounding the missile, and the defendants themselves. The sentencing demand is expected to follow on Wednesday and will include an ""extensive justification of the requested penalty,"" the spokesperson said. Prosecutors said during the opening of the trial in March 2020 that if the court passed a sentence ""we will do everything in our power to ensure that it is enforced, whether in the Netherlands or elsewhere."" The trial heard harrowing testimony from relatives earlier this year, who spoke of the heartbreak of the loss of children, parents and siblings, and called on ""corrupt"" Russia to provide justice. Kiev has been battling a pro-Moscow insurgency in two breakaway regions bordering Russia since 2014, when the Kremlin annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula. Western nations imposed tough sanctions on Russia amid international outrage over the shooting down of flight MH17. Russia has recently massed troops near Ukraine's borders and the West has for weeks accused it of planning an invasion, warning Moscow of massive sanctions should it launch an attack.

""We are continuing to watch closely Russia's alarming movement of forces and deployments along the border with Ukraine.""

Talks , Warning of  Military Response  to NATO Activity",English,Russia,"Russia demands immediate talks with the United States on security guarantees from NATO, a senior diplomat said Monday, while President Vladimir Putin’s chief arms control negotiator warned of a “military response” if the alliance continues to step on Moscow’s “sore spots.” Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov spoke days after Moscow made public a list of demands that seek to limit the U.S.-led Western military bloc’s role in Ukraine and the former Soviet space. “We need [answers] urgently since the situation is very serious and may get more complicated,” the state-run RIA Novosti news agency quoted Ryabkov as saying. Konstantin Gavrilov, who heads Russia’s delegation on military security and arms control talks in Vienna, echoed Ryabkov’s earlier warning of military action from Moscow in response to what it views as NATO’s threatening activities. “Everyone in NATO understands well that, despite all [its] strength and power, it needs to take concrete political actions,” Gavrilov said in a state television broadcast. “Otherwise the alternative is a military-technical and military response from Russia,” Gavrilov added without elaborating. Ryabkov, meanwhile, said he believes the West will “attempt to turn” Russia’s demands for negotiations “into a sluggish process.” The United States has responded to Russia’s demands for urgent talks by maintaining that it would not negotiate without input from Europe. The EU has rejected Russia’s bid to block Ukraine’s NATO ambitions. European officials have in recent days signaled a willingness to negotiate with Moscow, however. “We need to solve the current tensions on the diplomatic level,” the Financial Times quoted Germany’s new defense minister Christine Lambrecht as saying. “We will discuss Russia’s proposals . . . But it cannot be that Russia dictates to Nato partners their posture, and that is something that we will make very clear,” she said on a Sunday visit to German troops stationed in Lithuania — troops that Russia would like to see removed. “We will discuss these proposals that are currently on the table ... with all our partners in the EU and in NATO,” FT quoted German foreign ministry spokeswoman Andrea Sasse as saying. “It is important that in our dialogue that we have [with Russia] at the moment, we remain true to our own principles. And one of them is the indivisibility of the security of all NATO member states. And that has consequences for what we can and can’t accept.” In its list of demands published Friday, Russia demanded that the U.S. not establish any new military bases in ex-Soviet countries and that NATO guarantee to block these states' future memberships. Russia also wants NATO to abandon all military activities in Ukraine, Eastern Europe, the Caucasus region and Central Asia. Additionally, Russia wants NATO to pledge not to deploy troops in former-communist member states Poland, the Czech Republic and the Baltics without Moscow’s consent. Following Ryabkov's comments, the Kremlin announced that Putin will on Tuesday host an expanded Defense Ministry board meeting where it said the president will set out priorities for Russia’s Army and Navy. With the West watching Putin’s every move over fears of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, the military gathering will include the heads of each military branch, regional military districts, fleets and flotillas, as well as formations and military units. The top brass gathering will “evaluate the Russian Armed Forces’ activities in 2021 and set tasks and priorities for their further development next year,” the Kremlin said.",1,561,89.52,67.23,16.06,22.45,24.39,31.37,79.32,54.37,42.07,8.02,3.03,0,1.96,0,0.36,0.53,4.99,12.83,7.13,0.36,14.44,4.63,2.32,5.7,0.89,10.7,5.35,1.96,11.94,3.74,0.36,7.84,9.8,1.07,8.73,1.25,1.96,1.96,0.71,0.36,2.67,0,3.03,1.6,1.43,0.71,0.36,0.36,0.18,0,0,0,13.37,7.49,0.53,0.18,0.36,0,5.7,6.24,0,0,0.36,0.36,8.2,6.77,1.25,0.18,2.14,0.18,0,1.78,0.18,0,0.89,0.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.89,0.36,0.89,0,0,0.18,0,1.25,0,2.14,8.2,0.71,0.71,5.88,0.53,0.18,0.36,4.46,2.5,4.1,2.5,0,0,0,0,0,20.32,5.7,4.99,0,0,3.39,6.24
649,themoscowtimes.com,1640592000,https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/12/27/germanys-russia-test-a75932,Germany Russia Test - The Moscow Times,English,Russia,"The new German government’s Russia policy could not have gotten off to a more difficult start. Barely a week after Annalena Baerbock was sworn in as Germany’s new foreign minister, she had to expel two Russian diplomats after a Berlin court found a Russian FSB agent guilty of a 2019 “murder by state contract” in the city’s central Tiergarten park. Meanwhile, many of new chancellor Olaf Scholz’s meetings in his first week in office were at least partly dedicated to Russia’s unprecedented amassing of troops at Ukraine’s borders, and to Europe’s reaction. It’s no surprise that Moscow is testing the mettle of the longtime German chancellor Angela Merkel’s successor — and the EU’s readiness to stand firm in its Eastern Neighborhood. The timing is perfect for the Russian leadership to relegate the EU to the back seat of talks on European security: a new coalition has just been formed in Berlin, French President Emmanuel Macron is up for reelection in the spring, and a direct bilateral U.S.-Russian channel was recently established for strategic stability talks. The Normandy format (France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine) suffered a serious blow last month when the Russian Foreign Ministry published confidential letters it had exchanged with German and French diplomats. Moscow is taking advantage of the situation and demanding to discuss European security directly with the United States as the only actor the Russian leadership takes seriously and feels equivalent to — knowing full well that Washington’s priority is China. The publication of a proposed U.S.-Russian treaty drafted by Moscow, including a number of unrealistic demands regarding European security, casts doubt on Russia’s seriousness about parleying, especially given the backdrop of the open military threat to Ukraine. Under these circumstances, Germany’s traditional approach of engagement with Moscow is becoming increasingly difficult to pursue, especially in a three-party coalition with diverging approaches to Russia. Despite Russia’s violations of the European security order, Germany has always been a supporter of continuous engagement with Moscow. Although then Russian president Dmitry Medvedev’s proposals for a new European security order from 2009 were met with skepticism, Merkel and her foreign policy advisor Christoph Heusgen devised the “Meseberg initiative” in response. When deterrence measures became necessary, Germany advocated for respecting existing agreements, such as the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act, and preferred to station rotating troops rather than permanent ones in eastern NATO member states. This approach often caused frustration among the Eastern Neighbors, whose warnings ahead of the 2008 war in Georgia, the annexation of Crimea in 2014, and the war in Donbas were perceived as unfounded prophecies of doom in Berlin—until the nightmarish wake-up call of 2014. Underestimating Russia’s willingness to act militarily is not a mistake Germany will make twice. But it now lacks the counterpart for the diplomatic engagement it had in the past, as Moscow is showing no willingness to engage in talks with Berlin on European security. At the same time, the new-old Russia policy of the so-called “traffic light coalition” of the Social Democratic Party, the Free Democratic Party, and the Green Party is still in the making and reflects the different approaches of the three parties. After intense discussions on the best approach to Russia (between the normative approach backed by the Greens and to some extent the Free Democrats, and the engagement-oriented approach backed by the Social Democrats), a language was found that is deemed satisfactory to all. While it is still sharper than the language of previous coalition agreements, some differences remain. The focus on human rights and the rejection of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline by the Green Party is difficult to square with the Social Democrats’ legacy of Willy Brandt’s Ostpolitik and support for the pipeline. Furthermore, the question of a credible security policy toward Russia remains on the table: Green Party leader Robert Habeck has been fiercely criticized for his support of defensive weapon deliveries to Ukraine. Although the Greens have moved toward the center in terms of security policy, skepticism of the traditional concept of deterrence remains, just as it does in the left wing of the Social Democrats. How to deal with the Nord Stream 2 pipeline in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine will be the litmus test for the new coalition to prove that its Russia policy is more than the sum of its parts. In the last two years, Moscow has managed to strengthen its position in the neighborhood, particularly in Belarus and in the South Caucasus, and to put the European gas market under significant pressure. Now, on the 30th anniversary of the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Russian leadership is trying to underpin and substantiate its claim for influence in Ukraine. Germany and its new coalition government will have to adapt Berlin’s traditional approach of engagement to provide a credible response to Russia’s military threats.

The “unprecedented” U.S. export control measures are expected to be discussed at a White House meeting Tuesday. Washington will also reportedly closely coordinate its steps with key European and Asian partners that could be affected and encourage coordinated steps where appropriate. The tough sanctions would “halt Russia’s ability to import smartphones, key aircraft and automobile components, and materials from many other sectors,” according to Reuters. “They could have a major impact on Russian consumers, industrial operations, and employment,” the news agency cited the Biden administration official as saying. The reported export controls would mark a step beyond possible economic sanctions which the U.S. has already warned of. Earlier this month, U.S. President Joe Biden warned Russian leader Vladimir Putin that Moscow would be hit with sanctions “like none he’s ever seen” should it invade Ukraine.

Instead, Russian officials accuse U.S.-led NATO of threatening the country’s security with military exercises, weapons deployment and expansion near Russia’s western borders.

Both markets beat previous records from October, also struck on demand worries for the northern hemisphere winter months. They are currently about seven times greater than at the start of 2021. Runaway spot gas prices, alongside other buoyant commodities including crude oil, have fuelled mounting concern about spiking inflation worldwide. European gas ""continued its inexorable rise... to another record,"" wrote Deutsche Bank analysts in a client note. ""It comes as temperatures have continued to decline heading into the European winter, and we also got the news that [Russian energy giant] Gazprom had not booked any extra capacity in January for gas flowing through Ukraine."" ""That's an important story heading through the winter with implications for European growth, and one that will have investors closely following the weather forecasts to work out what might happen."" Europe's gas stocks had already been depleted by a prolonged winter last year. Added to the picture, calmer prevailing weather conditions have this year sharply reduced the supply of wind power. Some analysts blame the market spike on ongoing controversy surrounding Russia's planned Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.

The Baltic Sea pipeline is set to double supplies of cheap natural gas from Russia to Germany, which the European Union's top economy says is needed to help it transition from coal and nuclear energy. But the 10-billion-euro ($12 billion) project has for years been dogged by delays and drawn fierce criticism from both Germany's eastern EU allies like Poland and the United States.

The ill-fated flight heading for Kuala Lumpur took off from Amsterdam's Schipol airport in July 2014, and prosecutors this week launched closing arguments in the closely-watched trial. A verdict is not expected until late 2022 at the earliest. The four suspects on trial are Russian nationals Igor Girkin, Sergei Dubinsky and Oleg Pulatov, and Ukrainian citizen Leonid Kharchenko, accused of launching the BUK missile that hit the plane over war-torn eastern Ukraine. ""We are asking that the suspects Girkin, Dubinsky, Pulatov and Kharchenko, each for their responsibility of crashing a plane leading to the death and murder of 298 people, be sentenced to life in prison,"" prosecutor Manon Ridderbeks told the court Wednesday. All four have refused to appear in court in the Netherlands and are being tried in absentia. Prosecutors have argued this week that the four suspects played pivotal roles in securing the BUK system, which was most likely intended to strike a Ukrainian warplane. International investigators say the BUK missile was originally brought from a Russian military base, ostensibly to be used in the fight against Ukrainian forces. ""If we consider how much time the defendants put into planning and organising the deployment of the BUK, it is all the more poignant how little attention they appear to gave given to the risk of inadvertently shooting down a passenger aircraft,"" prosecutors argued, according to trial documents Wednesday. ""In legal terms, the defendants were civilians and were therefore not allowed to shoot at any aircraft, whether civilian or military."" The hearings come as fresh tensions soar over Ukraine, with the West accusing Moscow of planning an invasion. Kiev has been battling a pro-Moscow insurgency in two breakaway regions bordering Russia since 2014, when the Kremlin annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula. Russia has recently massed troops near Ukraine's borders and the West has for weeks accused it of planning an invasion, warning Moscow of massive sanctions should it launch an attack. Moscow denies the claims, with President Vladimir Putin seeking talks with U.S. counterpart Joe Biden and security guarantees to stand down his troops. Western nations imposed tough sanctions on Russia amid international outrage over the shooting down of flight MH17. The best known of the suspects, 49-year-old Girkin — nicknamed ""gunner"" — was one of the main separatist commanders at the start of the conflict with the Ukrainian army five years ago. He said Wednesday he was not surprised by the prosecutors' request, and denied the rebels shot down the plane. ""If they could have sentenced me to death, they would have done it, no doubt about it,"" he was quoted as saying by Russia's Interfax news agency. Dubinsky, 57, is said to be linked to Russian military intelligence, while Poulatov, 53, is a former member of the Russian special forces and Dubinsky's deputy.

German authorities are waiting for the pipeline's Swiss-based ""Nord Stream 2 AG"" operating company to submit documents to restart the certification process, BNetzA president Jochen Homann told a press conference. The pipeline would then also have to be approved by the European Commission, he said, ""which means that decisions on this will not be made in the first half of the year"". Nord Stream 2 was completed in September but BNetzA suspended the German approval process in November, saying it needed to become compliant with German law before it could be certified. The Baltic Sea pipeline is set to double supplies of cheap natural gas from Russia to Germany, which the EU's top economy says is needed to help it transition away from coal and nuclear energy. But the $12 billion project has for years been dogged by delays and drawn fierce criticism from Germany's eastern European Union allies like Poland and from the United States. Critics say the project will increase Europe's dependence on Russian gas and Ukraine has described it as a ""geopolitical weapon"". This week the new German government threatened to block the pipeline from operating if Russia invades Ukraine, amid growing alarm over Russian troop movements on the border.

Due to Covid-19 restrictions, media outlets were not able to apply for accreditation to the event for the first time since it was first held in 2001. Instead, the Kremlin hand-picked around 500 international and domestic journalists to participate. A number of critical independent outlets, including Novaya Gazeta — whose chief editor shared the Nobel Peace Prize this year — said they received no invite. In addition to the Ukraine crisis, journalists questioned Putin on topics ranging from Russia's crackdown on civil society and the coronavirus pandemic’s effect on the economy to his relationship with Russian Santa Claus in the nearly four-hour event. Here are the key topics he addressed: Several questions were dedicated to the situation with Ukraine, with Putin railing against Kiev and its Western allies for causing the recent surge in tensions and demanding that the West give Russia security guarantees “right now.” But he expressed optimism toward talks with Washington on Moscow’s series of proposed security guarantees that seek to shut NATO out of much of the post-Soviet world. He called the current negotiations with the U.S. “positive” and hinted at fresh direct talks in Geneva in the new year, saying: “The ball is in their court.” The West accuses Russia of plotting to invade Ukraine, which has been battling pro-Moscow separatists in its eastern Donbass region since 2014. Asked about the situation with Ukraine and whether a war was realistic, Putin replied that Russia was responding to threats from Kiev. He called the 2014 Maidan Revolution a “bloody coup d’etat” and accused Ukrainian “extremists” of planning operations to retake Crimea and the Donbass. “We must think about the prospects of our own security. We have to keep an eye on what is happening in Ukraine, and on when they might attack,” he says. Putin referred emotionally to the plight of Donbass’ inhabitants and stressed that the region’s residents alone should determine its future, adding that Russia was ready to act as a mediator to ""create a better future for the people living there.” Putin claimed that Ukraine “refuses to talk” to Donbass representatives and pointed a finger at Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who he said rose to power on promises to end the war and implement the Minsk Accords but had since “come under the influence of radical elements.” In response to a question about Moscow’s tensions with the West, Putin said his country’s actions will not depend on talks with the U.S. on his proposed security guarantees, but on the “unconditional provision of Russia's security.” He stressed that NATO’s expansion to the east was “unacceptable” and continued to slam the U.S., which he said “brazenly lied” about NATO’s “five waves of expansion.” “The U.S. is placing rockets at our doorstep... How would the U.S. react if we delivered rockets near their borders with Canada or Mexico?” he said. With the second year of the pandemic coming to a close and Russia’s excess death toll among the highest in the world, the coronavirus was a constant presence through the press conference. Putin bemoaned Russia’s low vaccination rate — currently at around 45% of adults after a year-long vaccination campaign — and blamed it for the country’s Covid-19 death rate, itself one of the world’s highest. Polls have shown that a consistent, though decreasing, majority of Russians are suspicious of the vaccine and do not plan to inoculate themselves. However, Putin reiterated his long-standing opposition to vaccine mandates, saying that those reluctant to vaccinate should be treated “respectfully” and have the issue “explained” to them. Nonetheless, the president singled out critics of vaccination, who he accused of using the issue to bolster their public profile and of being “dishonest.” Russia’s Communist Party opposition has been leveraging anti-vaccine and anti-lockdown sentiment into a modest increase in its own opinion polling in recent months. The first few questions of the press conference were dedicated to Russia’s economy, which has recovered to its pre-coronavirus state but has slowed in recent months. Putin said Russia had recovered better from the pandemic compared to many developed countries, listed off a number of economic statistics and said he expected real incomes — which are around 10% lower than they were in 2013 — to rise by 3.5% this year. But he listed growing inflation and the country’s demographic situation as major challenges facing the economy. Inflation is currently at a six-year high of 8.4% and he said Russian business figures complain to him every day about the high interest rates introduced by the Central Bank to tame price risis. However, he defended the Central Bank’s policy and its independence. “You can ‘scold’ the Central Bank for raising rates — as representatives of the real economy do, not on camera, but at meetings with me — but if you do not do this, it will be like in Turkey,” Putin said, referring to the Turkish lira’s extreme volatility in recent weeks after its Central Bank cut interest rates despite high inflation. The president also said Gazprom was not to blame for record gas prices in Europe and called on countries to sign long-term agreements with the Russian state-controlled gas company if it wants to ensure stable supplies at fixed prices. “With long-term contracts, prices are three, four, or even seven times cheaper,” Putin says. Europe has in recent years moved towards shorter-term agreements which give more flexibility, but require buying more gas at market prices. “I see these accusations that Gazprom has not booked extra capacity on the Yamal-Europe route. This is because buyers have not made any purchase orders.” Putin repeated his long-standing disdain of Western “liberal” values and defended so-called “traditional values” in response to a question from the state-run RT broadcaster on cancel culture and the controversy surrounding ""Harry Potter” author J.K. Rowling’s comments on transgender people. “I adhere to the traditional approach — a woman is a woman, a man is a man, a mother is a mother, a father is a father,” Putin said, adding that he hoped that Russians had enough defenses against gender-fluid ""obscurantism.” In his answer, Putin said cancel culture was ""like the coronavirus,” with new variants frequently appearing,” adding that following traditional values was Russia’s proposed “antidote.” Putin urged Western governments to “turn a page” on jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny’s poisoning and sought civil society’s help in investigating torture cases across Russian prisons. He claimed without evidence that Western countries have failed to provide proof of Navalny’s August 2020 poisoning with the Novichok nerve agent in Siberia. “Give us a reason to open a criminal case. But if there’s nothing to answer, let’s turn this page,” Putin said. “That Novichok or whatever it is — at least give us [samples],” Putin said. Putin hinted that Navalny serves “foreign interests” that he compared to figures who “destroyed” the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union “from the inside,” and accused the activist of using politics as a “shield” from his criminal conviction. Navalny returned to Russia in early 2021, where he was promptly sentenced to 2.5 years in prison for violating parole while in recovery abroad. When asked about Russia's labeling of independent media and NGOs as ""foreign agents"" this year, he said that such legislation originated in the U.S. in the 1930s and claimed that Russia's ""foreign agents"" law is more liberal than its Western equivalents. Putin also addressed the high-profile video leaks showing alleged rape and torture inside Russia’s prison system that drew nationwide attention this year. After claiming that prison torture also exists in the United States and France, Putin said Russian authorities have opened 17 criminal cases following the torture leaks. “It should be clear to everyone that punishment for these offenses is inevitable,” he said, adding that the investigations “should of course use the capabilities of civil society.” In addition to the host of reporters from domestic media, Putin took questions from British, Italian, Kazakh, Chinese and Belarusian outlets. In answers to the latter three, he stressed Russia’s strong, friendly economic and cultural relations with their respective countries. To an Italian reporter, Putin said that despite Italy’s membership in NATO and the EU, he hoped for ongoing cooperation with the country in various spheres. Meanwhile, he slammed a reporter from Britain’s Sky News for what he said was the West’s hostile foreign policy toward Russia. When asked about Russia’s relations with the new Taliban regime in Afghanistan, he did not say whether Russia would recognize the new government in Kabul, but said he hoped the situation in the country would be stable and warned against the penetration of extremists into the bordering Central Asian republics. He also called on the West to unfreeze Afghanistan’s financial assets, saying the country is on the brink of a widespread humanitarian crisis. Putin also discussed closer integration with Belarus and its embattled leader Alexander Lukashenko. Moscow and Minsk are working on a number of proposals to closer integrate the two countries, as Russia has become Belarus’ key financial and political supporter amid widespread international isolation of the Lukashenko regime over the past year. “We are building a ‘Union State,’” Putin said, but noted that the level of integration between Russia and Belarus was “at a much lower level than that in the European Union. It’s incomparable.” In an unexpected turn of events, Putin was asked about his relationship with Father Frost ⁠— the Russian version of Santa Claus. The question was asked by a journalist based in Veliky Ustyug ⁠— a town in northwest Russia that is home to the mythical figure. Putin thanked Father Frost for having helped him become president and urged the mythical figure to help carry out Moscow's plans. ""My relationship with Father Frost has always developed in a good way,"" Putin said. ""I am grateful to him that I can meet with you in my capacity…I can advocate for Father Frost and remind the plaintiff that Father Frost only fulfils the wishes of boys and girls who have been good.""",1,1680,92.5,53.57,27.48,8.55,25.45,28.45,82.32,60.24,45.89,8.21,4.35,0.48,0.54,0.18,2.32,0.54,3.87,13.93,8.45,1.73,16.19,5.3,2.5,5.54,0.65,11.61,6.85,3.63,5.71,1.96,0.71,3.04,9.64,0.3,9.35,1.96,1.31,0.95,1.43,0.54,3.63,0.06,5.18,1.9,3.15,1.31,0.48,0.71,0.24,0.12,0,0.06,14.52,7.44,0.77,0.12,1.25,0.77,3.69,6.37,0.54,0,0.3,2.98,3.93,2.68,1.25,0,3.21,0.06,0.12,1.9,1.49,0,1.61,1.13,1.01,0,0,0,0.06,0,0.12,0.42,0.3,0.36,0,0.18,0,0.06,0.6,0.12,3.33,9.52,0.36,0.83,7.98,0.36,0,0.18,3.21,4.88,3.04,1.37,0.12,0.12,0.06,0,0,18.87,5.06,4.17,0.06,0,2.44,7.14

NATO member Turkey has irritated Moscow by supplying combat drones to Ukraine that Russia fears could be used by Kiev in its conflict with separatists in two eastern regions. But Turkey has also upset Washington and NATO by acquiring an advanced missile defense system from Russia that resulted in sanctions from the United States. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu urged Moscow and the Western defense alliance to air their differences in direct negotiations proposed by NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg. Russia wants NATO to provide Moscow with a binding security guarantee and withdraw its forces to positions they held before a wave of eastward expansion that began after the Soviet Union's collapse. ""For any proposal to be accepted, it should be acceptable by both sides. Russia made some proposals. But maybe NATO seeks the same kind of guarantees from Russia. This is not a one-sided issue,"" Cavusoglu told reporters. ""If the requests are maximalist — I’m not saying that Russia is maximalist in any case — both sides must be constructive,"" he said. ""They should come to the table with proposals that both sides can accept."" A NATO spokesman said the Brussels-based alliance had been ""in touch"" with Moscow about holding a meeting of the NATO-Russia Council on Jan. 12. Russia has not yet formally accepted the offer. ""If Russia has any certain specific expectation or issue from Turkey regarding reducing tensions between Russia and NATO, Turkey will evaluate this positively because our objective is clear,"" said Cavusoglu.

Broadcaster RT — previously known as Russia Today — said on its website that YouTube had taken down its newly launched ""Auf Sendung"" (On Air) channel ""without explanation"". The 24/7 channel can still be viewed on other platforms, including on the RT DE website. A YouTube spokesperson told AFP that the channel was removed for trying to circumvent its earlier termination of RT's German channels RT DE and Der Fehlende Part. ""When a channel is terminated, the uploader is not allowed to use, own or create any other YouTube channels,"" the spokesperson said. ""As a result of this circumvention attempt, the new channel 'RT auf Sendung' was permanently removed for violating YouTube's terms of service."" Google-owned YouTube in September issued a warning to RT DE for violating its coronavirus disinformation guidelines and then shuttered two channels for breaching user terms. The move angered Moscow, which accused YouTube of ""censorship"" and said the ban was likely aided by German authorities at a time of strained diplomatic ties between the two countries. Berlin denied the claim and said it had ""nothing to do with"" YouTube's decision. The latest YouTube spat comes as tensions are running high between Russia and Germany, a day after a Berlin court sentenced a Russian to life in jail over a 2019 assassination on German soil it says was ordered by Moscow. The ruling prompted Germany to expel two Russian diplomats. Germany has also echoed Western alarm about Russia's troop movements on the border with Ukraine, with new chancellor Olaf Scholz warning on Wednesday that Russia would pay ""a high price"" for invading Ukraine. Launched in 2005 as ""Russia Today"", state-funded RT has expanded with broadcasters and websites in languages including English, French, Spanish and Arabic. It has generated controversy in many countries, including the United States, where it was required to register as a ""foreign agent"", and in Britain, where authorities have threatened to revoke its broadcasting licence.

After claiming that prison torture also exists in the United States and France, Putin said Russian authorities have opened 17 criminal cases following the torture leaks. “It should be clear to everyone that punishment for these offenses is inevitable,” he said, adding that the investigations “should of course use the capabilities of civil society.” In addition to the host of reporters from domestic media, Putin took questions from British, Italian, Kazakh, Chinese and Belarusian outlets. In answers to the latter three, he stressed Russia’s strong, friendly economic and cultural relations with their respective countries. To an Italian reporter, Putin said that despite Italy’s membership in NATO and the EU, he hoped for ongoing cooperation with the country in various spheres. Meanwhile, he slammed a reporter from Britain’s Sky News for what he said was the West’s hostile foreign policy toward Russia. When asked about Russia’s relations with the new Taliban regime in Afghanistan, he did not say whether Russia would recognize the new government in Kabul, but said he hoped the situation in the country would be stable and warned against the penetration of extremists into the bordering Central Asian republics. He also called on the West to unfreeze Afghanistan’s financial assets, saying the country is on the brink of a widespread humanitarian crisis. Putin also discussed closer integration with Belarus and its embattled leader Alexander Lukashenko. Moscow and Minsk are working on a number of proposals to closer integrate the two countries, as Russia has become Belarus’ key financial and political supporter amid widespread international isolation of the Lukashenko regime over the past year. “We are building a ‘Union State,’” Putin said, but noted that the level of integration between Russia and Belarus was “at a much lower level than that in the European Union. It’s incomparable.” In an unexpected turn of events, Putin was asked about his relationship with Father Frost ⁠— the Russian version of Santa Claus. The question was asked by a journalist based in Veliky Ustyug ⁠— a town in northwest Russia that is home to the mythical figure. Putin thanked Father Frost for having helped him become president and urged the mythical figure to help carry out Moscow's plans. ""My relationship with Father Frost has always developed in a good way,"" Putin said. ""I am grateful to him that I can meet with you in my capacity…I can advocate for Father Frost and remind the plaintiff that Father Frost only fulfils the wishes of boys and girls who have been good.""",1,1680,92.5,53.57,27.48,8.55,25.45,28.45,82.32,60.24,45.89,8.21,4.35,0.48,0.54,0.18,2.32,0.54,3.87,13.93,8.45,1.73,16.19,5.3,2.5,5.54,0.65,11.61,6.85,3.63,5.71,1.96,0.71,3.04,9.64,0.3,9.35,1.96,1.31,0.95,1.43,0.54,3.63,0.06,5.18,1.9,3.15,1.31,0.48,0.71,0.24,0.12,0,0.06,14.52,7.44,0.77,0.12,1.25,0.77,3.69,6.37,0.54,0,0.3,2.98,3.93,2.68,1.25,0,3.21,0.06,0.12,1.9,1.49,0,1.61,1.13,1.01,0,0,0,0.06,0,0.12,0.42,0.3,0.36,0,0.18,0,0.06,0.6,0.12,3.33,9.52,0.36,0.83,7.98,0.36,0,0.18,3.21,4.88,3.04,1.37,0.12,0.12,0.06,0,0,18.87,5.06,4.17,0.06,0,2.44,7.14

The Roskomnadzor media regulator confirmed Saturday that it had blocked OVD-Info's website because the Moscow region court had ruled that the group's activities were aimed at promoting ""terrorism and extremism"" in Russia. Troops withdrawn Russia announced Saturday that more than 10,000 troops had finished month-long drills near Ukraine, amid Western accusations that Moscow was plotting an invasion of its ex-Soviet neighbor. The Defense Ministry said in a statement that the drills for Southern Military District forces had taken place in a host of southern regions including Rostov, Krasnodar and Crimea, the latter of which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014. NATO sit-down NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has sought a meeting of the NATO-Russia Council next month and contacted Moscow to secure its attendance, an alliance spokesman said Sunday. ""We are in touch with Russia"" about the Jan. 12 meeting, the first proposed by Stoltenberg since Moscow made its sweeping security demands, said the NATO spokesman, who asked not be identified. Russia’s Foreign Ministry said it was considering NATO’S proposal to meet on Jan. 12. Gas games Russian energy giant Gazprom has rejected accusations that Moscow is limiting gas deliveries to Europe via the Yamal-Europe pipeline and denounced Germany's resale of gas to Poland amid soaring prices. The pipeline was operating in reverse mode this week, public data showed, sending gas from Germany to Poland as European gas prices ticked up. Chechen crackdown Six Chechen opposition activists critical of regional head Ramzan Kadyrov’s leadership have reported dozens of their relatives being detained or kidnapped over the weekend.

More Positively Despite Soaring Tensions – Poll,English,Russia,"Russians are more likely to have a positive view of the United States than view it negatively, according to a new independent survey published Thursday. Despite soaring geopolitical tensions, the Levada Center pollster's latest survey marks the first time in three years that Russians reported an overall favorable attitude toward the U.S. According to Levada, 45% of Russian respondents said they view the U.S. positively compared with 42% who view the U.S. negatively. Another 13% did not answer. “For the first time since July 2018, the share of respondents who view the U.S. positively exceeded the share of those who view it negatively,” Levada said. Russians’ attitudes toward the U.S. have improved significantly since spring 2021, when just 31% said they held a favorable view of the country. Levada also saw Russians growing more positive toward the European Union, with favorability growing from 38% in May to 48% in November. The EU’s unfavorable rating has also decreased from 45% to 38% over the same period. This change in attitudes comes amid heightened tensions between Moscow and Washington, with the U.S saying it fears Russia could be ramping up to invade Ukraine early next year. Russia denies planning an invasion and accuses U.S.-led NATO of threatening its security with eastward expansion and weapons deployment near its borders.

Weeks of Russian military buildup near the Ukrainian border have raised alarm in the West that Russia might invade Ukraine as early as January. Moscow, meanwhile, blames NATO for provocations and threatening its security. Russia has repeatedly said it wants a legally binding guarantee that Ukraine will never join NATO and that the alliance will halt its expansion toward Russian borders. In the list of demands published on the Russian Foreign Ministry website on Friday, Moscow asks NATO to abandon all military activities not just in Ukraine, but also Eastern Europe, the Caucasus region and Central Asia. Russia also asks the U.S. not to establish any new military bases on the territory of former Soviet states and for NATO to guarantee that it will block future membership for any former Soviet republic. Russia demands that NATO pledge not to deploy troops to Eastern Europe without Russian consent, with the alliance prohibited from increasing troop numbers past those of 1997, before NATO expanded into Eastern Europe. The proposal would de facto ban NATO from deploying forces in former-communist member states including Poland, the Czech Republic and the Baltics. Another point seeks to reaffirm that Moscow and the U.S.-led alliance “do not consider each other adversaries” and that the two will “resolve all disputes peacefully and refrain from the use of force.” Russia’s Foreign Ministry handed the list to visiting U.S. diplomat Karen Donfried this week and President Vladimir Putin reiterated his demand that talks between the U.S.and NATO on international legal guarantees for Russia’s security begin “immediately.” Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told journalists in Moscow on Friday that Russia was ""ready"" as early as Saturday to begin security talks with the U.S. He also said Moscow was “extremely disappointed” by signals coming from the West regarding Russia’s proposals on security guarantees. Meanwhile, the U.S. said it wouldn’t negotiate without input from Europe. ""We've managed to engage Russia over strategic concerns for decades,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said. ""There's no reason we can't do that moving forward to reduce instability, but we're going to do that in partnership and coordination with our European allies and partners.” A senior official on Friday told reporters that the United States was willing to discuss security proposals put forward by Russia but disagreed with parts of them. ""We are prepared to discuss them. That said, there are some things in this document that the Russians know will be unacceptable,"" the official told reporters on condition of anonymity. The EU on Thursday rejected Russia’s bid to block Kiev’s NATO ambitions and repeated that it will impose ""massive consequences and severe costs"" on Russia if the country decides to invade Ukraine. Earlier this week, Ryabkov warned that Russia will respond “militarily”  if the Western military bloc does not guarantee an end to its eastward expansion. The sweeping demands will have great consequences for the balance of power on the European continent and experts said the West was unlikely to accept the terms presented by Russia. “The demands from Moscow appear to make any negotiation much more difficult. Seeking limits on NATO deployments and exercises on the territory of NATO member states is likely to be a non-starter in Washington,” Matthew Rojansky, director of the Wilson Center's Kennan Institute in Washington, told The Moscow Times. “The Kremlin cannot have a realistic expectation it will get legally binding commitments of this nature from NATO, but that may not be the point — rather it may be to shape negotiations in the shadow of a looming military threat to Ukraine and, by extension, to Europe,” Rojansky added. Rojansky pointed out that the message from the West to Russia has also been clear, that any further “aggression against Ukraine or any other state will not be tolerated, and will be met with an unprecedented response.” “In sum, these will be difficult but still vitally important negotiations.” Russia-based experts also doubted the West was likely to accept the latest demands. “Publication of Russian proposed agreements with U.S. and NATO on [European security] may suggest that Moscow (rightly) considers their acceptance by the West unlikely,” Dmitry Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, tweeted shortly after Russia published the demands. Trenin added that Russia “will have to assure its security single-handedly, most probably by military-technical means.” Andrei Kortunov, head of the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC), a Kremlin-aligned think tank, said that the Kremlin likely doesn't expect the West to accept its demands. “This is a bargaining position — [the Kremlin] is trying to get some degree of partial acceptance. Of course, there is a real risk to making these sorts of demands, especially if the West takes a harsh position, but clearly, the Kremlin thinks that the risk is justified in the circumstances,” Kortunov told The Moscow Times.

Became  Arrogant  After Fall of Soviet Union – Gorbachev,English,Russia,"Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev said Friday that Washington grew ""arrogant and self-confident"" after the collapse of the Soviet Union, leading to the expansion of the NATO military alliance. In recent years President Vladimir Putin has grown increasingly insistent that NATO is encroaching close to Russia's borders, and Moscow last week demanded ""legal guarantees"" that the U.S.-led alliance will halt its eastward expansion. ""How can one count on equal relations with the United States and the West in such a position?"" Gorbachev told state news agency RIA Novosti on the eve of the anniversary of his resignation as the leader of the U.S.S.R. He noted the ""triumphant mood in the West, especially in the United States"" after the Soviet Union ceased to exist in 1991. ""They grew arrogant and self-confident. They declared victory in the Cold War,"" Gorbachev, 90, said. He insisted that it was ""together"" that Moscow and Washington pulled the world out of confrontation and the nuclear race. ""No, the 'winners' decided to build a new empire. Hence the idea of NATO expansion,"" Gorbachev added. However, he welcomed upcoming security talks between Moscow and Washington. ""I hope there will be a result,"" he said. Last week Moscow presented the West with sweeping security demands, saying NATO must not admit new members and seeking to bar the United States from establishing new bases in former Soviet countries. Putin said Thursday that Washington has been willing to discuss the proposals and talks could happen at the start of next year in Geneva. A senior U.S. official said Washington was ready for talks ""as soon as early January."" Gorbachev resigned as president of the Soviet Union on Dec. 25, 1991, days after the leaders of Belarus, Russia and Ukraine said the U.S.S.R. no longer existed.

They make the following direct demands of the U.S.: “The United States of America shall undertake to prevent further eastward expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and deny accession to the Alliance to the States of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The United States of America shall not establish military bases in the territory of the States of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics that are not members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, use their infrastructure for any military activities or develop bilateral military cooperation with them.” The agreement that Russia proposes to sign with NATO includes obligations that the Alliance exclude further expansion, including the accession of Ukraine, as well as other states, and refuse to conduct “any military activity on the territory of Ukraine, as well as other states of Eastern Europe, Transcaucasia and Central Asia”. Elsewhere, the document calls for a halt to activities that might be perceived as threatening security. “The Parties shall refrain from deploying their armed forces and armaments, including in the framework of international organizations, military alliances or coalitions, in the areas where such deployment could be perceived by the other Party as a threat to its national security, with the exception of such deployment within the national territories of the Parties.” In other words, NATO cannot carry out military activity near Russia’s borders although Russia, on its territory near NATO’s borders, has the right to do as it sees fit. All this simply restates what Moscow has long set out as its position and demands — most actively so in the last several weeks. The real question is why Russian leaders decided to put forward such a document knowing full well that their Western counterparts would reject it and refuse to even discuss its provisions. For the U.S. and NATO, agreeing would mean taking the politically unacceptable step of capitulating to Moscow. Also, why would the West suddenly feel the need for such a revolutionary revision to the post-Cold War system of European security? Simply put, there is not enough of a threat to consider such drastic measures. Moscow, presumably, understands this, indicating that it might have a different goal in mind: to obtain a refusal of its empty gesture so that it can say, “We offered and so we’re not to blame for what we do next”. In other words, the Kremlin is creating a pretext by which it can freely revise the existing system of relations — a step for which it apparently feels the time has come. If this is the case, we can expect Moscow to take steps demonstrating Russia’s determination to unilaterally change the status quo. And, because the scale of the proposals does not allow for simply accepting a refusal from the West and postponing the demands until the next round of diplomatic talks — that would undermine the credibility of the demands — the interesting thing now will be to see what the Kremlin does if it receives the negative response from the West that it apparently sought from the beginning.",1,537,93.43,28.77,40.25,18.04,33.56,28.68,85.29,63.31,52.89,7.64,1.68,0,0.74,0,0,0.93,5.96,18.62,11.36,0.19,16.57,5.96,3.91,5.96,1.12,10.8,6.7,2.42,8.94,2.79,0.56,5.59,12.48,0.19,12.29,2.05,1.49,1.86,2.05,0.74,4.47,0,4.66,2.23,2.42,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.01,5.77,1.12,0.19,1.68,0.37,1.3,2.79,0,0,0,0,7.82,7.08,0.74,0,2.05,0.56,0,1.3,0,0.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.19,0,0.93,0.56,0.19,0,0.19,1.49,0.37,2.98,11.17,0.37,1.3,8.19,0.74,0,0.37,2.61,0.93,4.1,1.86,0,0,0,0,0,11.73,3.91,4.84,0.19,0,0.74,2.05

Lavrov repeated President Vladimir Putin’s scathing criticisms of what Moscow perceives as threatening steps by the West, including NATO expansion eastward. Russia this month issued a series of sweeping security demands to the United States that include NATO withdrawing forces to positions held before the alliance's wave of eastward expansion following the Soviet collapse and banning Ukraine from joining NATO. Lavrov’s hour-long interview on Solovyov’s YouTube channel was published on the same day that the White House announced Russia-U.S. talks on European security on Jan. 10. “Russia can put its concerns on the table and we will put our concerns on the table with Russia’s activities as well,” an unnamed White House official was quoted by AFP as saying. Russia-NATO talks are then expected on Jan. 12, followed by talks with OSCE, Europe’s top security organization which includes the U.S., on Jan. 13. The diplomatic talks will pick up following weeks of Western warnings that Russia is amassing tens of thousands of troops on the Ukrainian border with the possible aim of invading the neighboring country. Putin denies plans of an invasion, instead threatening an “appropriate retaliatory” military response to what he calls the West’s “aggressive stance.” The Russian president said last week he had seen a “positive” response from the U.S. to Moscow's security proposals.",1,298,98.53,61.98,27.14,7.94,19.87,34.9,76.17,51.68,35.57,5.03,2.01,0.34,0.67,0,0.67,0.34,3.02,12.08,9.06,1.34,15.77,3.02,0.67,3.69,0,9.73,6.04,2.68,7.72,2.01,1.01,4.7,4.03,0,4.03,1.01,1.01,0.34,0.34,0,1.01,0,2.68,0.67,2.01,0.34,0,0.34,0,0.34,0,0,13.42,8.72,0.34,1.01,2.01,0.67,4.03,4.36,0,0,0,0.67,8.39,6.71,1.68,0,3.36,0,1.34,2.01,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.34,0,0,0,0,2.35,0,1.34,10.74,0.34,2.68,6.71,1.01,0,0,4.03,3.02,3.36,1.68,0,0,0,0,0,21.14,6.71,3.69,0,0,4.03,6.71

Prosecutors have asked the court to dissolve Memorial's Human Rights Center, which campaigns for political prisoners and other disadvantaged groups, for alleged failures to use the ""foreign agent"" label on all their publications and for justifying terrorism. As the Moscow City Court reconvened to hear the case, dozens of supporters gathered outside and observers were not allowed inside amid the coronavirus outbreak. Speaking in court, the prosecutors said Memorial's failure to properly mark its materials could harm Russians' ""psychological health"" and cause depression. The prosecution also said that the group's website contained information ""justifying terrorism and extremism,"" adding that it ""negatively affects children."" The trial comes in a year that witnessed an unprecedented crackdown on opponents of President Vladimir Putin, including the jailing of top opposition politician Alexei Navalny. But the move to shutter Russia's top rights group stands out and would have been unimaginable a few years ago. Authorities have also brought another case against Memorial International, the group's central structure, which is also accused of violating the ""foreign agent"" law. Next week, Russia's Supreme Court is set to re-convene to hear the case against Memorial International. The two cases are the largest threat to the organization's existence since it was founded in 1989 by rights activists including renowned scientist and Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov. They bookend a year that has seen authorities launch an unprecedented crackdown on the opposition and independent media, imprisoning Navalny in February and banning his organizations. The pressure on Memorial has led to a major outcry in Russia and the West. The Memorial Human Rights Center releases lists of people it says are political prisoners, including Navalny and members of religious minorities such as the Jehovah's Witnesses that have been outlawed in Russia. In October, the organization said there were at least 420 political prisoners in Russia, noting that their number had risen sharply this year. As well as political prisoners, the center also campaigns for groups facing pressure from authorities, including migrants and members of the LGBTQ community. ""Essentially we are doing what prosecutors should be doing, we are helping them,"" Memorial representative Alexander Cherkasov said in court. ""Our work is needed and important,"" he added. Activists have called on Putin to intervene, but he told his human rights council that Memorial had been advocating on behalf of ""terrorist and extremist organizations."" Memorial International coordinates the work of dozens of organizations across Russia. Russia's two living Nobel Peace Prize winners — the last Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Novaya Gazeta newspaper editor Dmitry Muratov — have urged prosecutors to withdraw their claims. ""Memorial is not an 'enemy of the people,'"" Muratov said in his Nobel acceptance speech in Oslo this month. ""Memorial is a friend of the people."" In another case next week, a court in the northwestern city of Petrozavodsk will deliver its ruling on Memorial employee Yury Dmitriyev, a historian the organization says is being targeted for his work exposing the horrors of the Soviet era. Sentenced last year to 13 years in prison on what his supporters say were fabricated child sex charges, he faces two additional years in prison. Memorial, which has become a symbol of post-Soviet democratization, has created a huge archive of Soviet-era crimes. The trial against it coincides with the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Soviet Union marked later this month.",1,585,93.82,61.39,14.57,1.63,22.5,32.14,81.71,55.04,43.59,6.84,2.74,0,0.51,0,1.37,0.85,4.1,15.04,9.06,1.54,14.53,6.5,1.54,4.44,0.51,11.45,5.3,4.1,10.43,1.71,1.71,7.18,5.81,0.17,5.64,0.51,1.71,0.85,0.17,0,2.56,0,5.47,1.2,4.27,0.34,0,0.34,0.17,0,0.17,0,12.14,5.81,0.17,0,1.03,1.37,2.39,6.15,0,0,0,1.37,4.96,3.76,1.03,0.17,3.25,0,0,2.91,0,0.34,3.59,0.51,0.17,0,0.17,0,0.34,0,2.39,0.17,0,0.51,0,0,0,0.34,0.34,0.34,3.42,8.21,0,1.03,6.84,0.17,0.51,0,3.59,5.3,3.08,0.17,0,0,0,0,0,14.87,4.44,4.27,0,0,2.22,3.93

The movie — whose trailer says is dedicated to “our Russian guys” — depicts the real-life events involving Russian mercenaries who fought in Mozambique’s northern Cabo Delgado region in 2019, its director Denis Neymand told The Moscow Times. “The movie was completely based on a Russian private military company in Mozambique. All of this happened in real life,” said Neymand, who also confirmed that Aurum ordered the production of the movie. The Moscow Times, along with other outlets, earlier reported on how hundreds of Russian soldiers fighting for private military company Wagner were deployed in Mozambique, with at least seven of them killed by the Islamic insurgents. Units of the secretive Wagner group have been seen in several conflict zones, allegedly serving Russian private and state interests in Ukraine, Syria and Libya. The group has recently stepped up its efforts on the African continent, fighting in Mozambique and the Central African Republic, and were reportedly invited to Mali this fall. Neymand said it “wasn’t a secret” during filming that the mercenaries on which the movie is based belonged to the Wagner group. “But we didn’t name them in the movie because it doesn’t really matter which private military company operates there. The movie is about showing how Russian guys help Africans against evil forces,” he said, adding that the movie was filmed in the Central African Republic, where Russia has a military presence. The Kremlin in 2019 denied that Russian soldiers were active in Mozambique, while Prigozhin has repeatedly said he has no links to Wagner and has sued media outlets for reporting his alleged connections to the mercenary group. But a number of recent movies produced by Prigozhin-linked firms, including Aurum and the St. Petersburg-based Paritet Film studio, depict Russian “instructors” fighting in eastern Ukraine and the Central African Republic — places where Wagner fighters have also reported to have been active. These movies — which share much of the same acting crew — appear to shed further light on Prigozhin’s links with Wagner. The EU earlier this month slapped sanctions on the group for destabilizing Ukraine and parts of Africa. Prigozhin was not immediately available for comment. Aurum was also behind the film “The Tourist,” which tells the story of a group of young Russian military advisors sent to CAR on the eve of its 2020 presidential elections. Numerous NGOs as well as independent UN observers say that these instructors are in fact paramilitaries from the Wagner Group. A March report by a group of independent UN experts said Wagner mercenaries have committed human rights abuses in CAR. Aurum additionally holds distribution rights for the film “Shugalei,” a movie also directed by Neymand which claims to tell the true story of Maxim Shugalei, a Russian political operative believed to be close to Prigozhin who has spent time in Libyan prison on accusations of meddling in the country’s internal affairs.",1,534,96.01,47.84,22.98,8.14,25.43,31.84,79.59,54.12,42.32,5.99,2.06,0,0.37,0,0.56,0.37,3.93,13.48,9.18,0.94,15.54,5.06,2.81,3.37,0.94,9.93,6.93,1.87,5.62,1.12,0.56,4.12,6.74,0.37,6.37,0.56,1.12,0,0.94,0.75,3.37,0,2.81,0.75,2.06,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.73,6.37,0.94,0,1.69,0.75,2.43,5.24,0,0,0,0.94,7.12,3.37,3.37,0.37,7.68,3,0,4.12,0.19,0.37,0.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.19,2.06,8.43,0.19,0.37,7.3,0.75,0,0,3,5.81,3.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.23,3.93,4.31,0,0,1.5,4.49

Poland this week accused Moscow of having stopped its deliveries via the Yamal-Europe pipeline that sends Russian gas to Western Europe, accusing Gazprom of ""manipulation"". The pipeline was operating in reverse mode this week, sending gas from Germany to Poland, public data showed, as European gas prices ticked up. President Vladimir Putin on Friday denied that the flow direction was a political move and said that Poland had ""sidelined"" Russia in managing the pipeline. ""All accusations against Russia and Gazprom that we are not supplying enough gas to the European market are absolutely groundless and unacceptable and untrue,"" Gazprom spokesman Sergei Kupriyanov said late Saturday, calling the accusations ""lies"". He said some buyers of Russian gas, in particular Germany and France, have not made additional orders, and slammed the reverse flow of gas that came as ""winter is just beginning"" as ""not the most rational decision."" ""I don't even want to talk about the price of such reverse supplies. These prices are significantly higher than the prices for contract volumes set by Gazprom, he said in an interview on state television. ""All problems in Western Europe have been created by themselves and there is no need to blame Gazprom for this. It is better to look in the mirror."" Western countries have for weeks accused Russia of limiting gas deliveries to put pressure on Europe amid tensions over the Ukraine conflict and to push through the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline set to ship Russian gas to Germany.

This year, the factory worker, who declined to give his last name, said a spike in prices meant he would have to forego caviar and other treats so he could afford a bottle of bubbly for the countdown on Russia's biggest holiday. People are making sacrifices across the country, with soaring inflation pushing up costs and forcing cash-strapped Russians to make difficult decisions around the holidays. ""Everything is getting more expensive but wages aren't going up,"" said Sergei Borisovich, who was shocked that a loaf of bread now costs 100 rubles ($1.35). President Vladimir Putin has described prices as a key concern and the embattled opposition is hoping to leverage the economic woes. This month, inflation reached its highest since 2016, with rising everyday costs hitting hard a population whose average monthly income is 40,402 rubles ($545). Adding to that, some 43% of Russians do not have any savings, according to a recent survey by recruitment website SuperJob. Sergei Borisovich said the table this year would be topped only with a salad of potatoes and peas. ""I'll buy some Shampanskoye if I can,"" he said referring to sparkling wine popular during the Soviet Union. Red caviar, served with bread and butter on New Year's Eve, is the most expensive it has been since monitoring began in 2000. Ingredients for other holiday dishes like the mayonnaise-rich salad ""Olivier"" are expected to cost 15% more than last year, Russian media has reported citing statistics agency Rosstat. ""Herring Under a Fur Coat"" — a layered dish of pickled herring and beetroot — will set Russians back 25% more than last year. Living standards in Russia have been gradually decreasing since Moscow was slapped with a slew of Western sanctions in 2014 over its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. Now, the dip is accelerating, hitting even those in Moscow, the wealthiest city. Karina Strukova, an engineer on maternity leave, says the trend forced her to stop buying groceries from the upmarket Vkusvill grocery chain in favor of the lower-cost Magnit stores. The 30-year-old told AFP her grocery bill had grown by as much as 25% since last year. ""We're trying to cut back on spending a bit because we don't have any other sources of income,"" she said. ""We're buying fewer gifts and going to cheaper shops."" Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, controversially jailed earlier this year on a fraud charge, said he had even felt the pinch behind bars. He wrote on Instagram that food prices have gone up by at least 40% in under a year at a shop where he is allowed to spend 9,000 rubles ($120) a month to supplement his meals. ""The great inflationary tragedy that pensioners are going through is unfolding before my eyes,"" he wrote. Polls have shown that decreasing purchasing power is a major concern for Russians, affecting trust in authorities and Putin's approval ratings. To curb galloping prices, the government has introduced price caps and export quotas, while the central bank has repeatedly hiked its key interest rate. The Russian leader has described inflation as ""the main problem today for both the economy and citizens"" and instructed officials to pull it back from over 8% to 4% in the coming year. But many causes of inflation are global, stemming from spending on post-pandemic recovery and disruptions in supply chains, said Igor Nikolaev of the Institute for Strategic Analysis at FBK Grant Thornton Russia. The situation is made worse in Russia, he said, where there are not enough actors in the market to push prices down. ""When there isn't enough competition, there's no mechanism preventing producers and sellers from increasing prices,"" Nikolaev added. At the market to buy gifts for her grandchildren, 88-year-old pensioner Svetlana Knyazeva says people can get used to anything. ""I can't say I have a bad life,"" she says, adding that she has a pension of almost 30,000 rubles ($400) a month.",1,676,90.31,50.63,19.16,23.98,23.31,23.82,83.14,58.58,44.38,7.25,4.14,0.74,0.44,0,2.51,0,3.11,13.61,7.54,3.11,15.24,7.25,2.07,4.59,1.04,14.79,6.07,6.51,3.4,0.89,0.59,2.07,8.14,0.44,7.4,1.04,2.07,1.18,0.89,0,1.92,0.15,2.96,1.48,1.18,0.89,0.15,0.44,0,0,0.3,0,9.76,4.14,0.44,0,0.15,0.15,2.66,5.03,0.3,0,1.04,1.63,2.07,0.59,1.04,0.44,9.02,1.04,0,2.81,6.21,0,2.81,0.3,0.15,0,0,0.15,0,2.22,0,0.3,0.15,0.74,1.33,0,0,0,0.3,0,4.88,9.17,0,2.22,6.51,0.44,0.15,0.3,4.59,4.73,5.33,1.48,0,0,0,0,0,19.08,4.44,5.77,0,0,1.63,7.25

But a fresh coronavirus wave in the summer was followed by an even more devastating surge in the fall fueled by the Delta variant, which saw Russia registering record cases in deaths and infections. And while Europe and the U.S. managed to curb their death tolls with the aid of mass vaccination campaigns, Russia was unable to follow suit, in large part due to widespread vaccine skepticism. By December, the country had registered over 900,000 excess fatalities since the start of the year, according to The Moscow Times calculations, and experts believe the number could hit the grim milestone of one million excess deaths by the end of the year. Independent demographers believe that Russia’s natural population  — excluding the effects of migration — has seen its largest decline since World War II. Russia’s leadership admitted in November for the first time during the pandemic that its excess mortality rate ⁠— a measure comparing total fatalities from all causes with a pre-pandemic baseline that is seen by demographers and statisticians as the most reliable indicator of lives lost to the pandemic ⁠— was directly linked to Covid-19. The fourth wave, which started in October, was especially deadly for the country, with hospitals once again overflowing and doctors raising the alarm. In the worst-hit month of October, the country saw 3,000 excess deaths a day. While daily infections and deaths have waned as the year-end approaches, virologists have warned that the country should prepare for new deadly waves in the new year, with the more infectious omicron variant gaining ground in a country where only 40% of the population is fully vaccinated. Vaccine diplomacy backfires As 2021 dawned, Russia, under the direction of its vaccine’s developer the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), was eager to boost the nation’s image through so-called vaccine diplomacy. But Sputnik V’s champions quickly found themselves embroiled in a string of scandals. In Slovakia and Brazil, the nation’s health regulators said they could not evaluate the risks and benefits of the vaccine due to a lack of data and inconsistencies in dosages. Argentina, one of the biggest buyers of Sputnik V, on multiple occasions, complained it was in a “very critical situation” as it faced shortages of second doses, which Russia said were more difficult to produce than the first ones. Guatemala also faced shortages, and in July canceled an order for eight million doses because of previous delays. The Moscow Times also investigated a secret scheme through which the RDIF granted a minor UAE royal exclusive rights to resell Sputnik V to at least five developing countries at a significant mark-up. The scheme led to a series of scandals in Lebanon, Kenya and Pakistan while Ghana’s parliament opened an official hearing following the reports. In 2022, Russia is hoping its growing partnership with India — a vaccine-producing powerhouse — will help solve the production issues. The RDIF has already promised to produce an impressive 3 billion doses of Sputnik V next year, as well as “several hundred million Sputnik Omicron boosters” to protect the world against the new strain. But for Sputnik V and other Russian vaccines to be accepted globally, EU and World Health Organization (WHO) approval is critical. At the start of the year, the WHO said its review of how Russia produces the Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine had found some issues with the filling of vials at a plant. Both the EU and the WHO have since said Russian manufacturers have yet to provide regulators with missing data for their ongoing review. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov in December said Russia had a “different understanding of what information was needed” for approval. 2022, the year of mass vaccination? Throughout 2021, the Kremlin grappled with the nation’s stubborn refusal to vaccinate, prompting Russian President Vladimir Putin, who received Sputnik V vaccine early in year, to complain in a public meeting in October that he “can’t understand what’s going on.” “We have a reliable and efficient vaccine. The vaccine really reduces the risks of illness, grave complications and death,” he added. Some critics have blamed the country’s leadership for vaccine skepticism, accusing the government of prioritizing its domestic agenda over the battle against the pandemic. At the height of the summer 2020 wave of infection, Moscow suddenly dropped all restrictions to push through a referendum on constitutional changes that allowed Putin to run for further terms as president, declaring that covid had been defeated. And later in the summer, a short-lived QR code program in Moscow and other cities was quickly abandoned after opposition from restaurateurs ahead of important elections to the Duma, Russia’s lower house of parliament. In the background, state-owned media were downplaying the pandemic and ridiculing other nations for their harsh lockdowns. Others say Russia’s low vaccination rate is part of a wider regional phenomenon, as other post-soviet nations including Ukraine and Armenia are also struggling to convince their populations to get the jab. The Kremlin can take some encouragement from a recent Levada poll showing the percentage of Russians willing to be vaccinated against the coronavirus rose from 15% in August to 19% in October, the highest number since the start of the pandemic. Levada also found that 42% of Russians were in favor of universal mandatory vaccination — up from 38% in June. Still, most of the country remains unvaccinated and Russia's vaccination rate has recently started to fall, after hitting a record 400 thousand doses a day during a short lockdown in November. A number of high-placed officials and top doctors have said that without a new and forceful push that would include nationwide mandatory vaccination, the country is unlikely to hit its target of 70% vaccinated. But Putin, whose electoral rating declined during the second half of 2021, has been wary of throwing his full backing behind unpopular Covid measures and has repeatedly said he is not in favor of forced vaccination and widespread QR codes. The Duma has already announced that it will scrap a proposed bill requiring QR codes to access public transport after criticism from Putin. It remains to be seen if Covid passes and other restrictions will be widely introduced across the country in 2022.",1,1050,97.56,34.1,49.82,4.18,27.63,30.76,83.43,58.57,46.1,4.57,1.52,0,0.1,0,0.38,0.57,3.05,16.38,10.67,3.24,16.67,5.05,2.38,5.52,0.29,9.62,6.95,6.29,4.19,0.38,0.57,3.43,8.38,0.19,8.19,2.1,1.43,1.05,0.48,0.29,2.95,0,5.71,1.81,3.9,0.86,0.1,0.67,0,0,0.19,0,6.76,3.9,0.57,0,1.05,0.48,1.33,2.1,0,0,0,0.38,2.1,1.52,0.57,0,2.67,0.1,0,2.38,0.29,0,6.38,5.05,4.19,0,0,0,0,0.1,1.14,0.38,0.1,0.57,0.1,0.67,0,0.29,0.48,0,3.33,8.95,0.38,1.33,6.67,0.67,0.1,0,6.48,4.76,2,0.76,0,0,0,0,0,12.67,3.71,4.57,0.1,0,1.33,2.95

At the behest of President Vladimir Putin, the Russian Supreme Court on Tuesday and Wednesday ordered the dismantling of the country’s two Memorial organizations: Memorial International, which has systematically documented the murderous atrocities perpetrated in the U.S.S.R by Josef Stalin, and Memorial Human Rights Center, which has promoted respect for human rights and the release of political prisoners in post-Soviet Russia. The forced closure of Memorial, after statements by prosecutors that harkened back to the Stalin era, provides ominous confirmation of Russia’s return to authoritarianism under Putin. The campaign against Memorial comes amid a wide-ranging crackdown by Putin on his political opponents and on activists who support democracy and human rights. Through forceful repression and the manipulation of Russia’s legal system, especially laws on “foreign agents” and “extremism,” the Kremlin has wiped out nearly all safeguards against the revival of Soviet-style abuses. The Supreme Court’s verdict against Memorial was preordained once Putin publicly expressed his disdain for the organization’s efforts to bolster public memory and protect human rights. Memorial began as an experimental movement in the late Soviet era when the far-reaching reforms introduced by Mikhail Gorbachev prompted a small group of leading dissidents and intellectuals in the U.S.S.R. to set up an organization that would pursue accountability for the crimes of the Stalin era. The notion of introducing accountability for abuses committed by political leaders was a stunning departure for the U.S.S.R., whose rulers had carried out terrible crimes with impunity. Soviet officials initially wanted to derail Memorial, but eventually they gave in and allowed it to be formally registered in 1989. During the remainder of the Soviet period, Memorial rapidly grew in influence, establishing itself as one of the world’s most highly respected organizations promoting human rights and historical reckoning. After the Soviet Union broke apart, Memorial survived and continued its work, linking Memorial International and the Memorial Human Rights Center.  During the period of relative freedom in the 1990s, Memorial pushed for the declassification of crucial records, published thick volumes of transcribed documents, and compiled databases of information about millions who were killed under Stalin’s rule.  The scale of Stalin’s crimes made it impractical to achieve a full reckoning with the past, but Memorial achieved more than was ever believed possible to ensure that Russians would have access to information about mass atrocities carried out by the Soviet regime. Memorial also sought to ensure that public officials in Russia would no longer be able to engage in violent abuses without accountability.  The organization publicized the cases of political prisoners, opposed curtailments of rights and freedoms, and decried atrocities carried out during Russia’s two wars in Chechnya. But even as Memorial pursued its invaluable work, obstacles gradually emerged.  In the late 1980s and early 1990s, many Soviet citizens were eager to learn about Stalin’s crimes. But in post-Soviet Russia, the trend was less auspicious.  Public interest in the Stalin era diminished and was gradually replaced by a fatalistic apathy. One of the leading reformers under Gorbachev, Aleksandr Yakovlev, who became a staunch supporter of Memorial’s work, commented in early 2001: “When I read all these materials about Stalin’s terror, I am appalled to see that Kremlin leaders were so cruel and destructive toward their own people. But what worries me even more is that the large majority of people in this country {Russia} nowadays are totally indifferent to this information.” The dwindling level of public interest was reinforced by the rise of Putin and the return to an authoritarian mindset in the Kremlin.  Soon after taking office, Putin revived symbols and features of the Stalin era.  In his address to the Federal Assembly in April 2005 he declared that the disintegration of the U.S.S.R. in late 1991 “was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the [20th] century.” Over time, he tried to prevent condemnations of the Stalin-era repressions, and some of his top aides even defended the abuses. In Dec. 2017, Putin’s long-time head of internal security, Aleksandr Bortnikov, argued that Stalin’s repression of millions had been largely justified because “the enemy was trying to defeat us, either in open battle, or relying on traitors within the country, and with their help stirring up trouble, dividing the people, and paralyzing the state’s capacity to react in a timely and effective manner to emerging threats.” Bortnikov insisted that “archival material shows there were objective grounds for a significant percentage of the criminal cases” during Stalin’s Great Terror. Putin has not gone quite as far as Bortnikov in whitewashing Stalin’s record, but his obfuscations about Soviet-era crimes have become more audacious in the years since Russia went to war against Ukraine. In a nationally broadcast speech announcing Russia’s annexation of Crimea in March 2014, Putin used Stalinist terminology, castigating “traitors” and “fifth columnists” in Russia who were supposedly trying to thwart his bid to restore Russian glory. Two months later, Putin signed into law a bill prohibiting criticism of the Soviet Union’s role in World War II. In the years since then, official images of Stalin as a “great leader” who spearheaded the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany have crowded out attempts to commemorate the tens of millions of victims of Stalin’s repressions. Putin has repeatedly made clear in recent interviews that although certain “excesses” occurred during the Stalin era, these should not detract from the “immense pride” that he and other Russians feel in the “national greatness” of the state built by Stalin. The revival of Stalinist phraseology was jarringly evident this week at the court hearings that liquidated Memorial.  The state prosecutor, Aleksei Zafyarov, accused Memorial of having committed “crude violations” of the “foreign agents” law, but most of his comments focused not on the law or the alleged violations but on Memorial’s work in documenting the Stalinist past. His scathing assessment of Memorial’s work and motives was reminiscent of the invective used by Stalin-era prosecutors in the 1930s and 1940s: It is obvious that ‘Memorial,’ having capitalized on the theme of political repressions in the 20th century, has created a deliberately false image of the U.S.S.R. as a terrorist state and has been whitewashing and rehabilitating Nazi war criminals whose hands are stained with the blood of Soviet citizens. Why should we, as descendants of the victors in that war, now feel obliged to watch the rehabilitation of national traitors and Nazi accomplices? Striking a theme championed by Putin in recent years, Zafyarov emphasized that “we, the descendants of the victors have no need to repent or to be embarrassed. We should be proud of our glorious past!” Although Memorial will be appealing the court’s decision, there is little prospect of success on such a high-profile case. But even if Memorial as a legal entity is now defunct, the guiding force behind the organization since 1989 — the desire to understand why so many millions of people were unjustly killed, tortured, and imprisoned in peacetime at the hands of their own rulers —will undoubtedly persist. Putin’s efforts to curtail scrutiny of the Stalin era may succeed in the short term, but the years of research undertaken by Memorial cannot simply be erased from the historical record. Although a renewed drive for historical accountability may be infeasible until Putin is gone from the scene, a new generation of Russians at some point will want to know why so many innocent people died under Stalin’s regime. The work of Memorial will give a crucial boost to any such quest for understanding.",1,1271,96.69,44.25,36.97,3.79,27.04,31.47,81.98,57.91,46.18,4.64,2.36,0.24,0.39,0,0.87,0.31,2.28,14.71,9.36,2.2,17.62,4.96,3.07,6.14,0.47,8.89,6.53,4.09,9.52,0.94,2.52,6.61,9.21,0.39,8.73,1.42,1.81,1.1,1.02,0.31,2.6,0.16,6.85,2.2,4.41,1.49,0.16,1.1,0.31,0.31,0.08,0,8.58,4.56,0.39,0,1.02,1.65,0.47,3.62,0.16,0.08,0,0.87,4.48,3.15,1.26,0.08,2.36,0,0,2.28,0,0.08,2.99,0.24,0.08,0,0,0,0,0,2.44,0.24,0.24,0.08,0,0.16,0,0.47,0.39,0.31,3.3,9.28,0.55,1.81,6.85,0.39,0,0.16,5.35,4.48,2.12,0.71,0.39,0.39,0,0,0,15.5,4.8,4.72,0.08,0.08,2.05,3.78

Will  Respond Decisively  if Russia Invades Ukraine,English,Russia,"U.S. President Joe Biden on Sunday told his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy that Washington ""will respond decisively"" if Russia moves to invade its pro-Western neighbor, the White House said in a statement. With a Russian military buildup on Ukraine's borders, Biden ""made clear"" to Zelenskiy during a phone call that the ""United States and its allies and partners will respond decisively if Russia invades Ukraine,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. The show of U.S. support for Ukraine comes days after Biden warned Russian President Vladimir Putin of severe consequences if Moscow launches a military invasion. In his call with Zelenskiy, Biden also stressed Washington's commitment ""to the principle of 'nothing about you without you,'"" in an apparent reference to the need to include Ukraine in negotiations about its own future. Zelenskiy tweeted afterwards that he appreciated the United States' ""unwavering support"" and that the call ""proves the special nature"" of the two countries' relationship. High-ranking U.S. and Russian officials are due to sit down on Jan. 9 and 10 in Geneva to discuss the crisis. Earlier this week, Biden spoke to Putin, the two leaders' second conversation by phone in three weeks as tensions mount over Ukraine. Discussing the call with Putin on Friday, Biden said: ""I'm not going to negotiate here in public, but we made it clear he cannot — I'll emphasize, cannot — invade Ukraine."" The U.S. leader added, in remarks to reporters during a holiday stay in Delaware, that he had ""made it clear to President Putin that we will have severe sanctions, we will increase our presence in Europe, with NATO allies"" if Russia invades Ukraine. Psaki also said in Sunday's post-call statement that Biden reaffirmed ""the United States' commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity."" The U.S. leader additionally ""expressed support for confidence-building measures to de-escalate tensions in Donbas and active diplomacy to advance the implementation of the Minsk Agreements."" Under the Minsk agreement — brokered by France and Germany — Ukraine agreed to carry out political reforms while Russia agreed to end its support for pro-Russian separatist rebels. Washington and its European allies accuse Russia of threatening Ukraine with a new invasion. Some 100,000 Russian troops are massed near the border of the country, where Putin already seized the Crimea region in 2014 and is accused of fomenting a pro-Russian separatist war which erupted that same year in the east. Moscow describes the troop presence as protection against the expansion of NATO, although Ukraine has not been offered membership in the military alliance. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke Friday with NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg; afterwards, Blinken urged Russia to ""engage meaningfully"" in the upcoming talks on the tense standoff between Moscow and Kiev. Stoltenberg said that NATO was ""united"" and ""prepared for dialogue."" In Thursday's call, Biden warned Putin against invading Ukraine, while the Kremlin leader said anti-Moscow sanctions would be a ""colossal mistake."" After a 50-minute phone call — their second in just over three weeks — both presidents indicated support for further diplomacy. Putin was ""pleased"" overall with the talks, foreign policy adviser Yury Ushakov told reporters. A senior U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the tone ""was serious and substantive.""",1,531,95.1,54.66,40.25,12.37,24.14,31.45,79.47,53.86,40.87,6.21,2.82,0.38,0.75,0.38,0.94,0.19,3.39,12.81,7.72,2.07,15.82,3.77,2.26,5.08,0.94,11.11,4.9,2.64,9.6,3.2,0.38,6.4,6.78,0.19,6.59,0.94,1.32,0.94,0.75,0.38,3.2,0,4.52,1.88,2.64,0.56,0.38,0.19,0.19,0,0,0,16.57,11.3,2.26,0,1.51,0.38,6.97,5.84,0,0,0,0.94,8.66,6.97,1.13,0.56,4.14,0.19,0.56,3.39,0.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.38,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.13,0,2.64,11.49,0.56,0.94,8.85,0.75,0,0.56,4.33,5.46,2.07,1.88,0.19,0.19,0,0,0,21.66,6.78,4.33,0,0,2.45,8.1

The visit comes as the West tries to deter Moscow from launching an attack on its ex-Soviet neighbour, which has battled pro-Kremlin separatists in two eastern regions bordering Russia since 2014. ""We are here first to reaffirm European Union's full support to Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" Borrell told a press conference with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. ""Any military aggression against Ukraine will have messy consequences and severe costs,"" he said in the village of Stanytsya Luganska in the eastern Lugansk region. ""And we are coordinating with the U.S., with NATO and other like-minded partners in order to work for de-escalation."" Borrell's visit, which he said illuminated ""destinies destroyed"" and ""families divided"", was the first by an EU foreign policy chief to eastern Ukraine since war broke out nearly eight years ago. The timing was right, Borrell said, because ""the geopolitical landscape is changing very quickly and the conflict on the borders of Ukraine is on the verge of getting deeper."" The deployment by Russia of tens of thousands of troops to the border has sparked fears in Kiev and among its Western allies of a wider war in Ukraine. Kuleba said he was ""glad"" the EU foreign policy chief had a chance to visit the frontline and ""feel the consequences of the conflict with his own eyes."" Ukraine and the European Union had a common goal, he said, which is ""to de-escalate the situation through diplomatic means so Moscow reduces tensions and abandons its aggressive intentions."" ""The European Union stands shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine in countering Russia's aggressive policy,"" the Ukrainian foreign minister said. The conflict in eastern Ukraine broke out shortly after Russia seized Crimea and has since claimed over 13,000 lives. Kyiv and its Western allies accuse the Kremlin of fomenting the rebellion, a claim Moscow has repeatedly denied. Russian President Vladimir Putin denies planning to attack the neighbouring country, saying the troop movements are to defend Russia against an encroaching Western military. Last month Moscow presented the West with sweeping security demands, saying NATO must not admit new members, including Ukraine, and seeking to bar the United States from establishing new bases in former Soviet republics. High-ranking officials from the United States and Russia are set to hold two days of talks in Geneva on the crisis starting Sunday. But Brussels fears it is being sidelined as Washington and Moscow discuss the balance of power in Europe. ""The limitation of spheres of influence of two big powers"" are no longer relevant, Borrell said Wednesday. ""There is no security in Europe without security of Ukraine. And it is clear that any discussion on European security must involve the EU and Ukraine. U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has sought to assure European allies that it will act in concert with them, dismissing suggestions that it could seek a Cold War-style agreement that affects Europe without its participation.

It's that the Kremlin actually believes Ukraine is planning a military seizure of Crimea and Donbass — where Russian-backed separatists have occupied territories for nearly eight years now — and Moscow is thus weighing options to pre-empt or respond to a potential offensive as it amasses troops on its south-western borders.  There has been a prevalent tendency in Western analysis to pin this Russian troop buildup — which began last spring and then renewed in earnest this fall — on a specific Russian goal of forcing guarantees of NATO non-expansion and then, in the event of a likely denial, using that as a pretext to invade Ukraine. There are limits to what we can know about Russian intentions, especially given that Russian foreign policy, while aggressive, tends to be more reactive than proactive. But one possibility that hasn’t really been factored into the various predictions of how Russia will act this winter is that the escalation is as much about Donbass as it is about NATO. Consider last week’s comments by Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who criticized the West for increasing weapons supplies to and conducting military drills with Ukraine. “The Kiev regime naturally perceives this support as a carte blanche for the use of force,” he said. “An adequate response will be given to any possible provocations by Kiev against Donbass.” Such comments — especially taken with the recent uncharacteristically aggressive warnings of his deputy Sergei Ryabkov — could be dismissed as merely part of a control drama, a deception staged by Moscow to indicate it is serious. But why the additional explanatory rhetoric when its troop amassments alone are quite enough for heavy metal diplomacy, if that is indeed all this was? Looking closely at the statements coming out of Moscow in recent months there has been a consistent strand where it essentially warns the West against backing a Ukrainian offensive. On Nov. 18, a few weeks after reports began emerging about Russian troop buildup, Vladimir Putin made his now famous “red lines,” statement, widely seen as the first harbinger of Moscow’s ultimatum for a new European security architecture on its own terms. But in his speech, he identified “Ukraine’s internal crisis” and its “failure to fulfill [Minsk] obligations” as Russia’s most pressing security issue. The West was “exacerbating” the situation by supplying Kiev with weapons. Putin quite clearly said “tensions should remain” — i.e. Russia would not deescalate — so long as there was risk of “them” — i.e. Ukraine and NATO — “staging some kind of conflict” on Russia’s western border. Then on Nov. 24, Security Council head Nikolai Patrushev alleged that the “West destroyed” Ukraine’s economy; as a result the country could “set ablaze” causing a security crisis for Russia, with an influx of thousands of refugees. It’s not clear how exactly Patrushev imagined Ukraine would “set ablaze,” and while Ukrainian domestic turbulence would affect the war in Donbass, it’s not easy to understand how this domestic turbulence would directly impact Russia’s security. Unless, that is, one imagines a highly unlikely scenario in which Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s government collapses, nationalist hardliners take over, and, with NATO assistance in the form of lethal weapons, attempt to retake Crimea and Donbass by force. Yet Ukraine has denied any such plans, while Zelenskiy has repeatedly affirmed his commitment to peace, all but ruling out any imminent military solution on Ukraine’s part. Why does Moscow, if its comments are genuine, continue to believe it? However unlikely a hardline nationalist offensive against Crimea or the Donbass may be, the Russians' concerns in part reflect Ukrainian politicians' own rhetoric.  Two of Ukraine’s military commanders have openly threatened Russia with force. In June, former special operations commander Serhiy Kryvonos said Ukraine should be ready to strike Russia with a swift “knockout” once it is weakened. To be fair, he did say that until that opportunity arises Ukraine should demonstrate its commitment to a peaceful resolution of the Donbass conflict. The current commander in chief of the armed forces, Valery Zalushny said in September that he'd like to drive a tank through Red Square. Granted, both these comments were made on prime-time public television — and the latter in response to a viewer’s question — but one would question the wisdom of trolling a powerful and paranoid neighbor that has a track record of taking such comments far too seriously. But it’s not just the rhetoric that the Russians seem to be responding to. In their view, a vocal, nationalist minority in Ukraine has consistently stymied all of Zelenskiy’s efforts to follow the Minsk Package of Measures toward a peaceful solution to Donbass. Alas, they are not wrong. In March 2020, Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, Andryi Yermak, met with the Kremlin’s point man on the Donbass issue, Dmitry Kozak, and agreed on a special Advisory Council in which Ukrainian officials would discuss the peace process with representatives of the Russian-backed separatist governments. In return, he was slapped with criminal charges by the SBU. Discussing peace with separatist leaders – something specifically stipulated in the Minsk agreements which Kiev signed – was deemed tantamount to treason. The charges didn’t go anywhere, but the damage was done. Talks ground to a halt. For Zelenskiy, any peaceful solution to Donbass seemed to have become toxic. To survive politically, he had to signal that he was determined to return Crimea — as with the summer 2021 creation of the Crimean Platform, intended to bring back the peninsula that Russia illegally annexed in 2014. The Russians seem to have read this as the final nail in the coffin of the Minsk agreement. Ukraine has no plan to follow through on peacefully reintegrating the statelets in Donbass. The only alternative, the Russians imagine, must be to retake the territories — as well as Crimea — by force. This triggered a change in Moscow’s policy towards Ukraine, and the renewed troop buildup this fall appears part of that change. The new approach was formulated by Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chairman of the security council who penned an uncharacteristically hawkish column arguing that Ukraine wasn’t a real country and therefore it was useless to talk to it. To get anything done, Russia deemed, it should really be seeking guarantees from the United States and NATO, and in Moscow’s view such adversaries only take force seriously. Once again, however unrealistic — and possibly outright delusional, since neither Ukraine nor other NATO members are actually beholden to Washington — this view from Moscow is, it is also backed by history. When a western-leaning politician, Mikheil Saakashvili, came to power in Georgia on the back of a popular coup in 2004, his first move was to try to rein in three pro-Russian separatist breakaway states — Adjara, South Ossetia, and Abkhazia as part of a wider bid of eventually joining NATO. Buoyed by the success of Adjara renouncing its separatist aspirations without a bullet being fired, and inspired by what he thought were promises of U.S. and NATO support, Saakashvili began to prepare to bring Abkhazia and South Ossetia back into the fold, this time militarily. For four years, Russia prepared for and anticipated his strike. This mutual escalation — both political and military — culminated in the Russia-Georgia war of 2008, when Russian troops invaded Georgia, pushed it out of Ossetia and Abkhazia, and officially recognized the two breakaway states as independent. Zelenskiy is no Saakashvili. He seems to have few illusions about NATO membership, and there is no real preparation in Ukraine to pull off what Saakashvili thought he could pull off in 2008. Moreover, both NATO and Washington have made it pretty clear that neither NATO nor U.S. troops would be fighting alongside Ukrainians in the event of a war with Russia. But for the Russians, this message has not been clear enough. It has also been muddled by developments in Ukraine, where there is a consistent mismatch between what Zelenskiy is saying he is committed to on the one hand, and his administration’s actions and the hawkish threats made by some military officials and commentators on the other. There is a stated commitment to the peaceful reintegration of rebel-held territories in Donbass, but in practice any proposed plan by the Zelenskiy administration for actually doing so is stymied. Meanwhile, the focus remains on NATO and U.S. support for Ukraine in the form of lethal weapons and military advisers, and on other measures of deterrence against Russia. These are all mixed messages in Russia’s view, and given that Ukraine doesn’t seem to have a plan on how to follow through on the Minsk agreement or work through the inherent inconsistencies in the document, Moscow seems to have chosen to operate on the assumption that while not necessarily imminent, a Georgian scenario is possible and even likely.  It is responding in kind. In September, I heard from a Kremlin adviser in the nationalist camp that Russia was preparing to officially recognize the statelets. At the time, I brushed aside the remarks as wishful thinking, but since then chatter to this effect has increased – not just among nationalist and patriotic outlets and experts, but in the more diplomatically oriented Russian International Affairs Council. Recognition of the statelets is costly for Russia — it means giving up on the Minsk scenario of reintegrating them back into Ukraine and having to sponsor them forever, bearing the costs of additional Western sanctions. But the current stalemate — where Russia feels it has to support the statelets and be prepared indefinitely to defend them and their borders from what it believes to be an unstable and belligerent Ukraine — is also costly and unsustainable. Now, according to a report last week in the respected Kommersant daily, government officials said that while Russia was not planning any unprovoked invasion, they were weighing recognizing the statelets and officially sending troops there in the event that talks with Washington fail to produce a satisfactory agreement. It is highly unlikely, if next to impossible, that the U.S. will agree wholesale to Russia’s shopping list, as Moscow has demanded. But while the new security architecture Russia is demanding doesn’t directly mention Donbass, it’s increasingly clear that the current escalation is about pushing for some kind of solution to the eight-year conflict — whether through a new security architecture, or, more modestly, through a new Minsk agreement that will be more palatable to Kiev than the current one. In some ways, all that’s left for the United States to do is precisely what the Biden administration has taken to doing. No breakthrough is going to come from the Jan. 10 talks, but they are a necessary platform where U.S. officials can hear Russian concerns and hopefully dispel misconceptions about what the U.S. is prepared to do – and especially what the U.S. is not prepared to do – when it comes to supporting Ukraine. But when it comes to support, that support should be as much, if not more, about helping Ukraine decide on what it actually wants to do about Donbass, and stick to it, for the sake of its own safety and integrity, as it is about deterring Russia.",1,1872,84.15,26.98,41.49,22.91,26.74,31.25,81.36,62.23,50.69,6.78,1.71,0.11,0.05,0,0.96,0.48,5.07,14.21,7.69,1.39,16.29,7.53,4.97,6.78,1.28,13.25,5.88,3.42,6.14,0.91,1.5,4.01,14.96,0.75,14,3.21,2.03,1.34,2.67,1.18,4.11,0,3.95,2.08,1.87,0.64,0.21,0.43,0.05,0.37,0,0,7.48,4.01,0.59,0.05,0.85,0.43,1.76,3.04,0,0,0,1.07,4.65,3.47,1.12,0.05,1.87,0.05,0.05,1.44,0.27,0.05,0.53,0.27,0.05,0,0.11,0,0,0,0.16,0.48,0.21,0.43,0,0.27,0,0.16,1.01,0.11,2.62,8.87,0.32,1.18,6.89,0.59,0.16,0.16,3.74,3.1,4.54,1.92,0.05,0,0.05,0,0,14.26,4.7,5.45,0.11,0,1.87,2.14

What could an agreement look like, and how likely is it? The talks have begun according to a Russian timetable and framed by Russia’s draft treaties with the United States and NATO. These proposals — in reality, sweeping demands — are unacceptable and their rejection may be intended to serve as the pretext for renewed aggression against Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin himself remarked on the “sceptical smiles” of his Foreign Ministry audience when he tasked it to prepare them. It is unthinkable that, as Russia threatens a massive use of force in Europe, NATO would de facto reverse its post-1997 enlargement, or America withdraw its nuclear weapons from the continent. Russia’s demands are, in any case, misdirection. Its immediate concern is not the 25-year history of NATO enlargement, but its own currently declining influence over Ukraine — whose Western ties are growing deeper, resistance to local pro-Russian figures like Viktor Medvedchuk sterner, and national identity stronger. Since time is not on Putin’s side, he is seeking to assert dominance over Kyiv while this is still possible, a goal hardened by his view that Ukraine is an essential part of Russia. Russia’s real driver, then, is more status and identity than security. These are harder goals for diplomacy to address. Security can be cooperative and mutual, as the U.S.-Russian agreement to extend the New START nuclear treaty last February showed. But great power revisionism is incompatible with the principle of sovereign equality that underpins international order, and threatens the security of other states. Nonetheless, the West has decided to engage with Russia rather than reject its demands outright. What can it discuss?  Russia’s ostensible and chronic grievance — NATO enlargement — and its real and urgent concern — Ukraine — overlap on the issue of Ukraine’s potential membership of NATO. Some seasoned Western diplomats with no illusions about Russia have long expressed concern over NATO’s 2008 Bucharest summit, which declared that Georgia and Ukraine “will become members of NATO.” Russia’s occupation of Ukrainian territory in practice makes it very unlikely that NATO would extend a collective security commitment to Ukraine. Russia’s own aggression has provided the assurance that it now demands of NATO. Does this mean, as some argue, that NATO should now assure Russia that Ukraine will never join? Critics condemn this as betraying a victim of aggression. But the argument should be addressed, not condemned. Western governments are accountable to their populations and guided by national interest. Last year they concluded that these interests were no longer compatible with long-standing commitments to Afghanistan, and swiftly abandoned the country to its fate, an outcome that probably emboldened the Kremlin’s coercion of Ukraine. Is it in the West’s interest to accommodate Russia’s designs on Ukraine? No, this realist case is flawed. Russia’s behaviour offers no assurance that a favorable deal would satisfy it. Not only do Russia’s demands on Ukraine extend far beyond the question of NATO membership, but it has never signalled that its interests are limited to Ukraine, or even to the territory of the former Soviet Union as a whole. On the contrary, through military, cyber, informational and energy instruments, Russia is pursuing a more assertive policy towards Europe — and not only NATO members — than during much of the Cold War. Its sweeping demands for NATO’s retreat only underscore the extent of its ambitions. A settlement over Ukraine would not be a solution, but a prelude. It would make the West less, not more, secure. Nor is constraining Ukraine’s freedom of choice likely to produce even local stability. In 2014 Russian pressure to stop former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych from signing an association agreement with the European Union triggered the mass demonstrations that forced him from power. With 72% of Ukrainians now viewing Russia as a threat, its diktat will not be accepted quietly. In short, the case against Realist accommodation is not only ethical but practical: In the 21st century, spheres of influence neither satisfy large aggressors nor can easily be imposed on small victims. But the West can usefully discuss some specific Russian concerns — not least as some would involve restrictions on actions the West has no intention of undertaking, such as deploying missiles in Ukraine that can hit Russia. But there should be no unilateral concessions — any offer requires a quid pro quo. Creative exploration of this nexus offers the best prospect of an agreement, even though Russia’s violation of past commitments, and the illegitimacy of its current position as an occupier of Ukraine, make this more difficult. But even in the best case, the win-set is small. Diplomatic success requires Russia to scale back its demands very substantially. It will only do so if it is persuaded that renewed aggression will bring more costs than benefits. The West can improve the slim chance of agreement by managing the diplomatic process in two ways. First, it must maintain the agreed negotiating format. Despite Russia’s clear preference for dealing only with the U.S. and major European powers, America has secured a three-track process that includes NATO and the OSCE as well as bilateral talks. It should make clear that all three tracks are equally important. This ensures the participation of all European states, including Ukraine and virtually guarantees there will be no rapid outcome. An inclusive process demonstrates Western cohesion and slows down the crisis. Second, the West must visibly plan for the worst case to show Russia it faces a severe and united response to renewed aggression. This will include severe economic and financial sanctions, and may cause Finland and Sweden to move closer to NATO membership. This would continue a trend of Russian actions producing the opposite effects to those intended, in this case, a stronger, larger NATO. In short, the West — not only the U.S. but Europe too — should conceive and conduct its diplomacy as part of, and not an alternative to, deterrence. This offers the main hope of averting Russian renewed aggression and the biggest clash of conventional forces in Europe since 1945.",1,1015,78.6,17.13,17.66,12.07,19.15,33,80.79,59.21,47.59,7.49,1.08,0,0,0,0.59,0.39,6.4,15.57,7.49,1.28,13.5,7.09,3.55,6.6,2.36,9.56,10.15,3.74,6.9,1.28,1.28,4.43,13.5,1.08,12.41,1.28,2.27,2.27,1.48,0.69,4.63,0,5.12,2.17,2.96,1.08,0.2,0.89,0,0.89,0,0,8.28,5.71,0.39,0.3,1.58,0.49,1.28,2.36,0,0,0,0.59,4.93,3.35,1.28,0.3,1.97,0,0.2,1.28,0.3,0.2,0.3,0.1,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.79,0.1,0.1,0,0.2,0,0.39,1.18,0.49,3.45,7.59,0.49,0.69,5.71,0.59,0.1,0.1,3.55,1.28,4.53,1.58,0,0,0,0,0,14.19,5.42,5.22,0.39,0,1.87,1.28

Meeting senior Kremlin envoys at their headquarters in Brussels, the NATO members said Moscow would have no veto on Ukraine or any other country joining the alliance, warning it would pay a high price if it invaded. ""Russia most of all will have to decide whether they really are about security, in which case they should engage, or whether this was all a pretext, and they may not even know yet,"" U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said. Putin's government has demanded the West to rule out accepting new members like Ukraine, Georgia or Finland on its eastern flank and has demanded limits on allied deployments in the former Soviet allies that joined NATO after the Cold War. Russia's massive troop build-up on Ukraine's borders has forced Washington to engage diplomatically — with bilateral security talks in Geneva on Monday, a NATO-Russia meeting on Wednesday and another planned at the OSCE in Vienna on Thursday. But the Western allies have received no promise that Russia will stand down its forces — which Moscow insists pose no threat to its already partially occupied neighbor — despite threatening massive economic sanctions if the Kremlin unleashes an invasion. Instead, the 30 member states invited the Russian envoys to return to Moscow and to advise Putin to join them for a series of confidence-building talks on limiting provocative military exercises, arms control and reciprocal limits on deploying missiles. ""Russia was not in a position to agree on that proposal. They didn't reject it either, but the Russian representatives made it clear that they needed some time to come back to NATO with an answer,"" alliance Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned: ""There are significant differences between NATO allies and Russia on these issues,"" he warned. Stoltenberg said it would be impossible for NATO members to agree to Moscow's core demands for a new security order in Europe, and in particular added that Russia would have no veto on Ukraine's right to eventually join the alliance. ""Ukraine as a sovereign nation... has the right to self-defense. Ukraine is not a threat to Russia,"" he said. ""It is Russia that is the aggressor. It is Russia that has used force and continues to use force against Ukraine. ""And then they're building up, with around 100,000 troops, artillery, armour, drones, tens of thousands of combat-ready troops and threatening rhetoric — that's the problem."" The West defends NATO's ""open-door policy"" towards potential future members, while Moscow is demanding a cast-iron guarantee that the alliance will not expand further towards its territory, seeing the westward tilt of one-time Warsaw Pact or Soviet allies as a threat. Before Wednesday, the NATO-Russia council had not met since 2019. NATO and Russia broke off practical cooperation in 2014 after Moscow occupied and annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea. Russia's diplomatic mission to the alliance was withdrawn in October last year after eight of its staff were expelled on allegations of espionage. But the former ambassador — now a deputy foreign minister — Alexander Grushko was back to confront Stoltenberg and Sherman, having earlier this week described the meeting as a ""moment of truth."" After the meeting, the senior U.S. diplomat said: ""Together, the United States and our NATO allies made clear we will not slam the door shut on NATO's open-door policy. ""NATO has never expanded through force or coercion or subversion. It is countries' sovereign choice to choose to come to NATO and say they want to join."" Just ahead of the talks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""The continuation of NATO's open-door policy and the further advancement of NATO towards our borders is precisely what, from our point of view, threatens us. ""This is exactly what we are asking not to continue through legally-binding guarantees."" The allies have threatened massive economic and financial sanctions against Moscow if its huge troop build-up on Ukraine's frontiers and in Russian-occupied Crimea turns into a new invasion. Peskov refused to be drawn on whether Russia could launch a military operation if denied. ""We would not like to throw around threats and ultimatums like American officials,"" he added. Russia has put intense pressure on Ukraine since 2014, after a revolution overthrew a government that had sided with the Kremlin against moving closer to Europe. Russia has seized and annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea and Moscow backs an insurgency in eastern Ukraine in which more than 13,000 people have died.",1,763,88.21,41.61,53.56,7.34,24.61,28.57,81.91,57.4,46,6.95,2.49,0,0.92,0,0.39,1.18,4.46,12.19,7.08,1.05,16.12,6.55,1.83,6.95,1.83,12.45,5.24,2.75,11.4,4.98,0.26,6.16,11.66,0.92,10.62,0.79,1.57,1.31,1.83,0.79,5.5,0,4.85,1.7,3.15,0.13,0,0.13,0,0.13,0,0,13.76,8.52,2.36,0.26,2.1,0,3.15,6.68,0,0,0,0.52,6.16,5.11,1.05,0,2.36,0,0.13,1.57,0.66,0,0.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.13,0.39,0.13,0.26,0,0,0,0,2.1,0.13,4.19,9.83,0.39,1.44,7.99,0.26,0,0.13,4.59,4.46,3.67,1.7,0.26,0,0.26,0,0,16.51,4.85,4.46,0,0,1.97,5.24

S ., Russia Hold High - Stakes Talks on Ukraine",English,Russia,"Top U.S. and Russian officials held crucial talks Monday with tensions soaring over Ukraine and security demands from Moscow, but there was little hope of a diplomatic breakthrough. The high-stakes negotiations come amid fears of a Russian invasion of its pro-Western neighbor Ukraine, and with Moscow demanding wide-ranging concessions from Washington and its NATO allies. Monday's talks in Geneva launch a week of diplomacy between Russia and the West after Moscow amassed tens of thousands of troops at the Ukrainian border, drawing the United States into a Cold War-style stand-off. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov opened their meeting at the U.S. mission in Geneva at 8:55 a.m. (07:55 GMT). A convoy of black vehicles with Russian diplomatic plates had arrived shortly before, and was ushered through the large iron gates under a billowing U.S. flag. The two diplomats had already met informally in the Swiss city on Sunday evening, with Ryabkov afterwards telling Russian news agencies the first meeting had been ""difficult."" State news agency RIA Novosti on Monday quoted Ryabkov saying he feared Washington was not taking seriously Moscow's demand of an end to NATO's eastward expansion. Pointing to a 2008 promise by NATO to consider membership for Ukraine and others, Ryabkov said: ""Are they ready to give legal guarantees that this country, as well as other countries... will not join NATO?"" ""I have a rather pessimistic forecast in this regard."" Sherman said on Twitter that the talks were underway but there would be little progress without others at the table. ""The U.S. will listen to Russia's concerns and share our own, but we have been clear we will not discuss European security without our allies and partners,"" she said. Sherman in the talks on Sunday had stressed ""the freedom of sovereign nations to choose their own alliances,"" the State Department said. In the muddy trenches on the frontline in Ukraine, where Kyiv's forces have been battling pro-Russian fighters since 2014, there was little hope for diplomacy. ""I doubt that anything will change,"" 29-year-old soldier Mykhailo said as he walked through trenches in the town of Avdiivka, just north of the separatist stronghold city of Donetsk. ""Guarantees of not joining NATO will never stop"" Russian President Vladimir Putin, Mykhailo said, adding: ""He wants to return the Soviet Union in version 2.0."" Both sides have set firm lines, with Washington warning that Moscow would face severe diplomatic and economic consequences from an invasion of Ukraine, and Russia demanding wide-ranging new security arrangements with the West. After Monday's talks, a meeting of the NATO-Russia Council will take place in Brussels on Wednesday, then the permanent council of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) will meet in Vienna on Thursday with the issue of Ukraine expected to dominate. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken stressed Sunday that Russia had to choose between dialogue and confrontation, warning on CNN that there would be ""massive consequences for Russia if it renews its aggression on Ukraine."" Blinken warned that any positive outcome from the talks would rely in part on Russia's willingness to stand down from its aggressive posture, which he likened to ""an atmosphere of escalation with a gun to Ukraine's head."" Any direct military action by the United States or NATO in defense of Ukraine is extremely unlikely. But Western officials have warned Moscow would face significant economic and financial consequences if it invades, and could see NATO boost its presence and capacities near Russia's borders. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Monday that the alliance would be warning Russia of the ""severe costs"" of an invasion. He said he did not expect this week's talks to ""solve all the issues,"" but wanted to kickstart a diplomatic process. ""We are aiming for an agreement on a way forward, a process, a series of meetings,"" Stoltenberg said before talks with Ukraine's deputy prime minister in Brussels. Measures against Russia under consideration include sanctions on Putin's inner circle, canceling Russia's controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany or, in the most drastic scenario, severing Russia's links to the world's banking system. Moscow insists it was deceived after the Cold War and understood that NATO would not expand eastward. Instead, the U.S.-led alliance welcomed most of the former Warsaw Pact countries and the three Baltic nations that were under Soviet rule. Russia has put intense pressure on Ukraine since 2014 after a revolution overthrew a government that had sided with the Kremlin against moving closer to Europe. Russia seized the Crimean peninsula and backs an insurgency in eastern Ukraine in which more than 13,000 people have died. ""The Cold War is over, and so are spheres of influence,"" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted ahead of Monday's talks.

The high-stakes negotiations came amid fears of a Russian invasion of its pro-Western neighbor Ukraine, and with Moscow demanding wide-ranging concessions from Washington and its NATO allies. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said he had assured his U.S. counterpart, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, that those fears were unfounded. ""We explained to our colleagues that we have no plans, no intentions to 'attack' Ukraine... There is no reason to fear any escalation in this regard,"" he told reporters after the talks. Ryabkov said the United States ""took Russian proposals very seriously"" and that Moscow was ""for the continuation of dialogue."" Sherman said that she offered to make reciprocal moves with Russia on missiles and exercises, but renewed warnings of major costs if Moscow invaded Ukraine. She said the United States was ready to meet again, but that Russia had not offered assurances that it will pull back troops amassed near Ukraine. And she insisted that some of Russia's demands were ""simply non-starters,"" including a ban on NATO's further eastward expansion. ""We will not allow anyone to slam closed NATO's open-door policy,"" Sherman said. Monday's talks in Geneva launched a week of diplomacy between Russia and the West after Moscow amassed tens of thousands of troops at the Ukrainian border, drawing the United States into a Cold War-style stand-off. Both sides have set firm lines, with Washington warning that Moscow would face severe diplomatic and economic consequences from an invasion of Ukraine, and Russia demanding broad new security arrangements with the West. After Monday's talks, a meeting of the NATO-Russia Council will take place in Brussels on Wednesday, then the permanent council of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) will meet in Vienna on Thursday with the issue of Ukraine expected to dominate. Sherman renewed a call on Russia to pull back its estimated 100,000 troops. If Russia invades, she said, ""there will be significant costs and consequences, well beyond what they faced in 2014,"" when Moscow seized the Crimean peninsula and backed an insurgency in eastern Ukraine. Ryabkov denounced U.S. threats as ""attempts at blackmail and intimidation,"" but said ""I don't think the situation is hopeless."" Any direct military action by the United States or NATO in defense of Ukraine is extremely unlikely. But Western officials have warned Moscow would face significant economic and financial consequences if it invades, and could see NATO boost its presence and capacities near Russia's borders. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Monday that the alliance would be warning Russia of the ""severe costs"" of an invasion. He said he did not expect this week's talks to ""solve all the issues,"" but wanted to kickstart a diplomatic process. ""We are aiming for an agreement on a way forward, a process, a series of meetings,"" Stoltenberg said before talks with Ukraine's deputy prime minister in Brussels. Measures against Russia under consideration include sanctions on President Vladimir Putin's inner circle, cancelling Russia's controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany or, in the most drastic scenario, severing Russia's links to the world's banking system. Moscow insists it was deceived after the Cold War and understood that NATO would not expand eastward. Instead, the U.S.-led alliance welcomed most of the former Warsaw Pact countries and the three Baltic nations that were under Soviet rule. Russia has put intense pressure on Ukraine since 2014 after a revolution overthrew a government that had sided with the Kremlin against moving closer to Europe. Russia seized the Crimean peninsula and backs an insurgency in eastern Ukraine in which more than 13,000 people have died. The heaviest of the fighting has subsided but clashes continue almost daily, with the Ukrainian army saying Monday that two of its soldiers died after an explosion from an unknown device. The army also accused separatist forces of firing at its positions with grenade launchers, machineguns and small arms. In the muddy trenches on the frontline, there was little hope for diplomacy. ""I doubt that anything will change,"" 29-year-old soldier Mykhailo said as he walked through trenches in the town of Avdiivka, just north of the separatist stronghold city of Donetsk. ""Guarantees of not joining NATO will never stop"" Putin, Mykhailo said, adding: ""He wants to return the Soviet Union in version 2.0.""",1,771,91.35,37.09,40.98,10.06,24.09,28.92,81.32,57.85,44.49,6.61,2.46,0.26,0.65,0,1.43,0.13,4.15,13.88,7.78,1.56,15.43,4.93,2.33,6.36,1.56,12.19,5.19,3.63,8.3,2.2,0.65,5.45,10.25,0.91,9.08,1.04,1.43,1.04,1.82,0.78,3.5,0,4.41,1.69,2.72,0.78,0.13,0.65,0.39,0.13,0.13,0,12.71,8.56,1.04,0.52,1.3,0.26,4.54,4.15,0,0,0.52,0.91,6.1,5.06,1.04,0,3.37,0,0.13,2.46,0.91,0,0.65,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.26,0,0.39,0.52,0,0,0,0,1.3,0,2.98,11.93,0.52,1.95,8.69,0.13,0.13,0.65,3.89,5.84,1.82,2.08,0,0,0,0,0,18.29,5.58,5.19,0,0,1.95,5.58

The European Union's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the bloc was mobilizing ""all its resources"" to aid its ally after the attacks temporarily brought down sites, including those of the foreign ministry and cabinet. Kyiv said the damage was limited and held back on apportioning blame but the ex-Soviet country has accused Russians with links to Moscow for previous hits on websites and key infrastructure. ""As a result of a massive cyberattack, the websites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a number of other government agencies are temporarily down,"" a foreign ministry spokesman told AFP. The foreign ministry website earlier Friday displayed a message in Ukrainian, Russian and Polish warning Ukrainians that their personal data had been compromised. ""All information about you has become public, be afraid and expect the worst,"" the message read. The education ministry also said its website had been targeted in a ""global"" hack overnight while the emergencies ministry site was brought down as well. Within hours of the initial announcement, the SBU security services said access to most sites had been restored and that the fallout was minimal according to initial estimates. ""The content of sites has not been changed and according to preliminary information no personal data was leaked,"" the SBU security service said in a statement. The SBU said access to many of the affected sites had been restored with the remainder to return online ""soon."" Kyiv has not yet blamed any individual or entities and Borrell said it was too early ""to point the finger at anybody. We don't have proof."" But he added: ""You can imagine who did this."" In October 2020, the United States charged six Russians with carrying out cyber attacks on Ukraine's power grid, the 2017 French elections and the 2018 Winter Olympics. The Justice Department at the time said the six were current or former members of the GRU Russian military intelligence and were also accused of staging a malware attack called ""NotPetya"" that infected computers of businesses worldwide causing nearly $1 billion in losses. The latest attack came at a time of soaring tensions between Russia and the West over Ukraine, a close ally of the United States and Europe. The West has accused Russia of deploying tanks, artillery and about 100,000 soldiers on Ukraine's war-torn eastern border in recent weeks, in what NATO says is preparation for an invasion. Moscow says it has no plans to invade Ukraine. Footage published by the Russian Defense Ministry Friday showed Russian tanks and infantry carrying out firing drills near the city of Rostov-on-Don in southern Russia near Ukraine. Moscow says this is a response to what it sees as the growing presence of NATO in its sphere of influence, where it fiercely opposes the expansion of the Atlantic alliance. Russia also says the U.S.-led military alliance should not admit Ukraine or Georgia as new members. This week the United States and its NATO allies held talks with Russia in an attempt to ease tensions, but all three rounds of negotiations — in Geneva, Brussels and Vienna — proved unsuccessful. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Thursday that Moscow saw no reason to hold a new round of security talks with the West following a lack of progress. Ryabkov also said he did not rule out the possibility that Moscow could deploy forces to allies Venezuela or Cuba if diplomacy failed.",1,587,94.12,42.07,50.79,2.72,24.46,29.64,82.96,58.26,44.46,4.77,1.19,0,0.17,0.34,0.34,0.17,3.58,14.99,10.05,1.53,14.31,5.79,2.21,6.13,1.36,11.93,6.64,3.24,6.47,1.53,0.68,4.26,8.18,1.02,7.16,1.53,1.53,0.85,1.87,0.17,2.39,0,4.26,0.85,3.41,0.34,0,0.34,0.17,0.17,0,0,11.07,8.18,1.36,0,1.53,1.02,4.09,3.58,0,0.34,0,0.51,7.67,4.43,1.53,1.7,2.39,0.17,0.17,2.04,0.17,0,0.34,0.17,0.17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.17,0,0,0.51,0,0,0,0.85,0,2.39,11.58,0.17,1.36,9.03,0.68,0,0.51,5.11,8.01,3.41,0.68,0,0,0,0,0,12.44,4.43,2.9,0,0,0.68,4.43

S ., Russia Hold High - Stakes Talks on Ukraine War Fears",English,Russia,"Russia ruled out Sunday any concession at talks with the United States on soaring tensions over Ukraine, as Moscow, facing strong pressure to pull back troops, seeks a wide-ranging new security arrangement with the West. Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told Russian news agencies ahead of his talks in Geneva the Kremlin was ""disappointed"" with signals coming from Washington and from Brussels, where NATO and the European Union are based. The high-level discussions kick off a week of diplomacy in which Russia will meet with NATO and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), as the United States tries to assure European allies they will not be sidelined. Since late last year, Russia has amassed tens of thousands of troops at the Ukrainian border and demanded guarantees that NATO will not expand further eastward. The Kremlin is insisting NATO must never grant membership to ex-Soviet Ukraine, which is pushing to join. The United States, to be represented by Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, agreed to talks even though it made plain that many of Moscow's proposals are non-starters. Originally scheduled to start on Monday, Sherman is now due to have a working dinner with Ryabkov on Sunday evening, said a State Department spokesperson. Russia's Foreign Ministry posted footage of Ryabkov's plane arriving in Geneva. ""We will not agree to any concession. That is completely excluded,"" Ryabkov said before departing. ""We are disappointed with the signals coming in the last few days from Washington but also from Brussels."" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, dismissing Moscow's demands as ""gaslighting"", has insisted that talks will yield no progress so long as Russia has a ""gun to Ukraine's head."" ""We're prepared to respond forcefully to further Russian aggression. But a diplomatic solution is still possible and preferable if Russia chooses it,"" Blinken said Friday. Russian President Vladimir Putin met his US counterpart Joe Biden in Geneva in June and agreed on regular ""stability"" talks between Sherman and Ryabkov. In two phone calls to Putin, Biden has warned of severe consequences if Russia invades Ukraine. Measures under consideration include sanctions on Putin's inner circle, cancelling Russia's controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany or, in the most drastic scenario, severing Russia's links to the world's banking system. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, warned that Washington would also send more troops to eastern NATO members such as Poland and the Baltic states if Russia invaded Ukraine. Europeans have showed solidarity, with EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell visiting the frontline in Ukraine, although some nations are expected to hesitate at the strongest measures. ""Whatever the solution, Europe has to be involved,"" EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said. Russia insists it was deceived after the Cold War and understood that NATO would not expand. Instead, the U.S.-led alliance welcomed most of the former Warsaw Pact countries and the three Baltic nations that were under Soviet rule. Russia has put intense pressure on Ukraine since 2014 after a revolution overthrew a government that had sided with the Kremlin against moving closer to Europe. Russia seized the Crimean peninsula and backs an insurgency in eastern Ukraine in which more than 13,000 people have died. At a time when Russia is also intervening to shore up allies facing popular uprisings in Belarus and Kazakhstan, Moscow has insisted it wants concrete progress in talks with Washington. Putin's foreign policy adviser Yury Ushakov warned after the call with Biden that the United States would make a ""colossal mistake"" if it went ahead with sanctions. ""It is very likely that we will encounter the reticence of our U.S. and NATO colleagues to really perceive what we need,"" Ryabkov said Sunday. In spite ""of the threats that are constantly formulated against us ... we wil make no concession,"" he said, adding it would ""amount to acting against the interests of our seccurity."" NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg, meeting foreign ministers of the alliance on Friday, said there remained real risks of a Russian invasion. But John Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, described the Russian troop build-up as a ""gigantic bluff"" by Putin to seek a negotiated agreement. ""They are trying to see if the Biden administration or Europe will blink,"" said Herbst, now at the Atlantic Council think tank. ""As long as the Biden administration remains at least as strong as it is now,"" he said, ""it probably is enough to keep Putin from striking large into Ukraine, but I don't rule out something smaller.""

After talks with U.S. diplomats in Geneva and with more negotiations to come in Brussels, ""it's too early to tell whether the Russians are serious about the path to diplomacy or not,"" Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters. Psaki said it remained to be seen ""if they're prepared to negotiate seriously — we are — or whether they'll use discussions as a pretext that diplomacy couldn't possibly work."" The next round of talks will be between NATO and Russia on Wednesday, with a third session between the OSCE regional security body and Russia planned for Thursday. Washington and its European allies are pressuring Russia to pull a large force back from the border with Ukraine, while Moscow is pushing the West to agree to a long list of what the Kremlin says are security guarantees. Psaki reiterated the U.S. rejection of Russia's demand that Ukraine not be offered NATO membership one day, saying this is ""a matter only for Ukraine and the 30 NATO allies, not for other countries to determine."" ""There are a range of discussions that can be part of a diplomatic path but ultimately it's up to the Russians to determine about whether they're going to take a serious approach to it or not,"" she said.",1,230,80.5,18.24,71.83,15.38,32.86,25.65,88.7,68.7,53.04,6.96,2.17,0,0.43,0,0.43,1.3,4.78,12.17,8.26,1.3,17.39,9.13,4.78,7.83,2.17,17.83,7.83,3.04,4.78,1.74,0.87,2.17,13.04,0,13.04,2.17,0.87,0.87,2.17,0.87,6.52,0,1.3,0.43,0.87,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.3,8.26,1.3,0.43,0.43,0,5.65,3.91,0,0,0.43,0,4.78,3.48,1.3,0,4.35,0,0.43,3.91,0,0,0.43,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.43,0,0,0,0,1.3,0,3.04,10.43,0,1.74,7.83,0.87,0,0.43,4.35,3.04,7.39,3.04,0.43,0,0.43,0,0,15.22,4.78,3.04,0,0,3.04,4.35

Meeting senior Kremlin envoys at their headquarters in Brussels, the NATO members said Moscow would have no veto on Ukraine or any other country joining the alliance, warning it would pay a high price if it invaded. ""Russia most of all will have to decide whether they really are about security, in which case they should engage, or whether this was all a pretext, and they may not even know yet,"" U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said. Putin's government has demanded the West to rule out accepting new members like Ukraine, Georgia or Finland on its eastern flank and has demanded limits on allied deployments in the former Soviet allies that joined NATO after the Cold War. Russia's massive troop build-up on Ukraine's borders has forced Washington to engage diplomatically — with bilateral security talks in Geneva on Monday, a NATO-Russia meeting on Wednesday and another planned at the OSCE in Vienna on Thursday. But the Western allies have received no promise that Russia will stand down its forces — which Moscow insists pose no threat to its already partially occupied neighbor — despite threatening massive economic sanctions if the Kremlin unleashes an invasion. Instead, the 30 member states invited the Russian envoys to return to Moscow and to advise Putin to join them for a series of confidence-building talks on limiting provocative military exercises, arms control and reciprocal limits on deploying missiles. ""Russia was not in a position to agree on that proposal. They didn't reject it either, but the Russian representatives made it clear that they needed some time to come back to NATO with an answer,"" alliance Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned: ""There are significant differences between NATO allies and Russia on these issues,"" he warned. Stoltenberg said it would be impossible for NATO members to agree to Moscow's core demands for a new security order in Europe, and in particular added that Russia would have no veto on Ukraine's right to eventually join the alliance. ""Ukraine as a sovereign nation... has the right to self-defense. Ukraine is not a threat to Russia,"" he said. ""It is Russia that is the aggressor. It is Russia that has used force and continues to use force against Ukraine. ""And then they're building up, with around 100,000 troops, artillery, armour, drones, tens of thousands of combat-ready troops and threatening rhetoric — that's the problem."" The West defends NATO's ""open-door policy"" towards potential future members, while Moscow is demanding a cast-iron guarantee that the alliance will not expand further towards its territory, seeing the westward tilt of one-time Warsaw Pact or Soviet allies as a threat. Before Wednesday, the NATO-Russia council had not met since 2019. NATO and Russia broke off practical cooperation in 2014 after Moscow occupied and annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea. Russia's diplomatic mission to the alliance was withdrawn in October last year after eight of its staff were expelled on allegations of espionage. But the former ambassador — now a deputy foreign minister — Alexander Grushko was back to confront Stoltenberg and Sherman, having earlier this week described the meeting as a ""moment of truth."" After the meeting, the senior U.S. diplomat said: ""Together, the United States and our NATO allies made clear we will not slam the door shut on NATO's open-door policy. ""NATO has never expanded through force or coercion or subversion. It is countries' sovereign choice to choose to come to NATO and say they want to join."" Just ahead of the talks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""The continuation of NATO's open-door policy and the further advancement of NATO towards our borders is precisely what, from our point of view, threatens us. ""This is exactly what we are asking not to continue through legally-binding guarantees."" The allies have threatened massive economic and financial sanctions against Moscow if its huge troop build-up on Ukraine's frontiers and in Russian-occupied Crimea turns into a new invasion. Peskov refused to be drawn on whether Russia could launch a military operation if denied. ""We would not like to throw around threats and ultimatums like American officials,"" he added. Russia has put intense pressure on Ukraine since 2014, after a revolution overthrew a government that had sided with the Kremlin against moving closer to Europe. Russia has seized and annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea and Moscow backs an insurgency in eastern Ukraine in which more than 13,000 people have died.",1,763,88.21,41.61,53.56,7.34,24.61,28.57,81.91,57.4,46,6.95,2.49,0,0.92,0,0.39,1.18,4.46,12.19,7.08,1.05,16.12,6.55,1.83,6.95,1.83,12.45,5.24,2.75,11.4,4.98,0.26,6.16,11.66,0.92,10.62,0.79,1.57,1.31,1.83,0.79,5.5,0,4.85,1.7,3.15,0.13,0,0.13,0,0.13,0,0,13.76,8.52,2.36,0.26,2.1,0,3.15,6.68,0,0,0,0.52,6.16,5.11,1.05,0,2.36,0,0.13,1.57,0.66,0,0.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.13,0.39,0.13,0.26,0,0,0,0,2.1,0.13,4.19,9.83,0.39,1.44,7.99,0.26,0,0.13,4.59,4.46,3.67,1.7,0.26,0,0.26,0,0,16.51,4.85,4.46,0,0,1.97,5.24

Senators Ready Sanctions if Russia Invades Ukraine,English,Russia,"U.S. senators from President Joe Biden's Democratic Party on Wednesday threatened major consequences if Russia invades Ukraine, including sanctions on President Vladimir Putin, Russian banks, and $500 million in fresh security aid to Kyiv. The introduction of legislation comes as the United States and its NATO allies hold talks with Russia and warn of high costs if the tens of thousands of troops on Ukraine's border advance. ""We are coming together to send a clear message — Putin need not collapse his entire economy nor does he need to sacrifice the lives of his own people in a futile attempt to rewrite the map of Europe,"" said Senator Bob Menendez, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said the legislation ""serves as a powerful deterrent by immediately and forcefully imposing crippling sanctions"" if Russia invades. The so-called Defending Ukraine Sovereignty Act would mandate U.S. sanctions on Putin and an array of top Russian officials as well as on at least three major financial institutions. It would also penalize services such as the SWIFT international banking network if they deal with sanctioned Russians. The act would provide $500 million in additional military aid to Ukraine to face off a Russian invasion, more than doubling what the Biden administration has provided in the past year. U.S. lawmakers across party lines take a hard line against Putin, who has denied plans to invade Ukraine but made security demands including guarantees that NATO will not expand into its neighbor, where a pro-Moscow insurgency has raged since 2014. But the Democratic-led legislation comes amid a feud in Congress as Republicans led by Senator Ted Cruz call a vote on a bill that would slap sanctions on businesses involved in Nord Stream 2, a gas pipeline built from Russia to Germany that has long been opposed by Ukraine which fears losing leverage. Democrats agreed to the vote in a deal in which Cruz lifted a months-long holdup of Biden's ambassadorial nominees, but the Biden administration has been pressing hard against his bill, saying it would put at risk an understanding with Germany to stop the pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine.

Says No Progress With Russia as Long as  Gun to Ukraine Head  ",English,Russia,"U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned on Wednesday that Russia must ease pressure on Ukraine if it wants progress, as he renewed a warning of ""massive consequences"" for an invasion. Russia and the United States hold talks next week in Geneva after Moscow amassed tens of thousands of troops on the Ukrainian border and asked the West for guarantees against expanding the NATO alliance. If the talks are ""going to show real progress, that will require de-escalation,"" Blinken told a joint news conference with German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock. Pointing to Russia's hopes for progress in areas such as arms control, Blinken said, ""It's very hard to make actual progress in any of these areas in an atmosphere of escalation and threat with a gun pointed to Ukraine's head."" ""Russia should be in no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine would have massive consequences and severe costs in response,"" Blinken said. Baerbock, paying her first visit to Washington since taking office, agreed on the need for ""severe consequences"" if Russia attacks Ukraine. The United States and Germany have been at loggerheads for years over Nord Stream 2, which is set to open and ship Russian gas directly to Europe's largest economy. ""From our perspective, it's very hard to see gas flowing through that pipeline, to become operational, if Russia renews its aggression,"" Blinken said. Drawing criticism at home, President Joe Biden's administration has declined to impose sanctions over Nord Stream, saying it was virtually complete. But the administration last year reached an agreement in which Germany promised aid to Ukraine and warned Russia against using the pipeline for geopolitical advantage. Baerbock, asked if Germany was ready to cancel the pipeline, said only that the new government backed last year's agreement with the United States. The new government ""agreed that we take effective measures together with our European partners should Russia use energy as a weapon,"" she said.",1,319,94.37,43.76,11.84,3.82,26.58,29.47,78.37,55.8,40.44,6.27,1.88,0,0.94,0,0.94,0,4.39,11.29,6.27,0.94,16.61,5.02,1.25,5.64,0.31,13.79,5.96,2.82,7.21,2.19,1.88,3.45,11.29,0,11.29,0.31,2.82,2.19,2.19,1.88,3.45,0,4.7,1.25,3.45,0.94,0.31,0.63,0,0.63,0,0,11.6,8.15,0.94,0,1.57,0,5.02,3.45,0,0,0.63,0.31,6.9,5.64,1.25,0,3.76,0,0.31,2.51,0.94,0,0.63,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.94,0.63,0.94,0,0.31,0,0.31,2.19,0,3.45,8.15,0.94,0.63,5.64,0.63,0,0.63,4.7,4.7,2.82,2.19,0,0,0,0,0,16.93,4.39,5.64,0,0,2.19,4.7

S . it Has  No Intention to Invade Ukraine,English,Russia,"Russia told the United States at tense talks Monday that it had no plans to invade Ukraine, as the two sides agreed to more efforts to keep tensions from turning into a full-blown confrontation. After more than seven hours of negotiations in Geneva, the Russian and U.S. negotiators both offered to keep talking, though there was no sign of a major breakthrough. The high-stakes negotiations came amid fears of a Russian invasion of its pro-Western neighbor Ukraine, and with Moscow demanding wide-ranging concessions from Washington and its NATO allies. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said he had assured his U.S. counterpart, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, that those fears were unfounded. ""We explained to our colleagues that we have no plans, no intentions to 'attack' Ukraine... There is no reason to fear any escalation in this regard,"" he told reporters after the talks. Ryabkov said the United States ""took Russian proposals very seriously"" and that Moscow was ""for the continuation of dialogue."" Sherman said that she offered to make reciprocal moves with Russia on missiles and exercises, but renewed warnings of major costs if Moscow invaded Ukraine. She said the United States was ready to meet again, but that Russia had not offered assurances that it will pull back troops amassed near Ukraine. And she insisted that some of Russia's demands were ""simply non-starters,"" including a ban on NATO's further eastward expansion. ""We will not allow anyone to slam closed NATO's open-door policy,"" Sherman said. Monday's talks in Geneva launched a week of diplomacy between Russia and the West after Moscow amassed tens of thousands of troops at the Ukrainian border, drawing the United States into a Cold War-style stand-off. Both sides have set firm lines, with Washington warning that Moscow would face severe diplomatic and economic consequences from an invasion of Ukraine, and Russia demanding broad new security arrangements with the West. After Monday's talks, a meeting of the NATO-Russia Council will take place in Brussels on Wednesday, then the permanent council of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) will meet in Vienna on Thursday with the issue of Ukraine expected to dominate. Sherman renewed a call on Russia to pull back its estimated 100,000 troops. If Russia invades, she said, ""there will be significant costs and consequences, well beyond what they faced in 2014,"" when Moscow seized the Crimean peninsula and backed an insurgency in eastern Ukraine. Ryabkov denounced U.S. threats as ""attempts at blackmail and intimidation,"" but said ""I don't think the situation is hopeless."" Any direct military action by the United States or NATO in defense of Ukraine is extremely unlikely. But Western officials have warned Moscow would face significant economic and financial consequences if it invades, and could see NATO boost its presence and capacities near Russia's borders. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Monday that the alliance would be warning Russia of the ""severe costs"" of an invasion. He said he did not expect this week's talks to ""solve all the issues,"" but wanted to kickstart a diplomatic process. ""We are aiming for an agreement on a way forward, a process, a series of meetings,"" Stoltenberg said before talks with Ukraine's deputy prime minister in Brussels. Measures against Russia under consideration include sanctions on President Vladimir Putin's inner circle, cancelling Russia's controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany or, in the most drastic scenario, severing Russia's links to the world's banking system. Moscow insists it was deceived after the Cold War and understood that NATO would not expand eastward. Instead, the U.S.-led alliance welcomed most of the former Warsaw Pact countries and the three Baltic nations that were under Soviet rule. Russia has put intense pressure on Ukraine since 2014 after a revolution overthrew a government that had sided with the Kremlin against moving closer to Europe. Russia seized the Crimean peninsula and backs an insurgency in eastern Ukraine in which more than 13,000 people have died. The heaviest of the fighting has subsided but clashes continue almost daily, with the Ukrainian army saying Monday that two of its soldiers died after an explosion from an unknown device. The army also accused separatist forces of firing at its positions with grenade launchers, machineguns and small arms. In the muddy trenches on the frontline, there was little hope for diplomacy. ""I doubt that anything will change,"" 29-year-old soldier Mykhailo said as he walked through trenches in the town of Avdiivka, just north of the separatist stronghold city of Donetsk. ""Guarantees of not joining NATO will never stop"" Putin, Mykhailo said, adding: ""He wants to return the Soviet Union in version 2.0.""",1,771,91.35,37.09,40.98,10.06,24.09,28.92,81.32,57.85,44.49,6.61,2.46,0.26,0.65,0,1.43,0.13,4.15,13.88,7.78,1.56,15.43,4.93,2.33,6.36,1.56,12.19,5.19,3.63,8.3,2.2,0.65,5.45,10.25,0.91,9.08,1.04,1.43,1.04,1.82,0.78,3.5,0,4.41,1.69,2.72,0.78,0.13,0.65,0.39,0.13,0.13,0,12.71,8.56,1.04,0.52,1.3,0.26,4.54,4.15,0,0,0.52,0.91,6.1,5.06,1.04,0,3.37,0,0.13,2.46,0.91,0,0.65,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.26,0,0.39,0.52,0,0,0,0,1.3,0,2.98,11.93,0.52,1.95,8.69,0.13,0.13,0.65,3.89,5.84,1.82,2.08,0,0,0,0,0,18.29,5.58,5.19,0,0,1.95,5.58

S .- Russian Security Talks : What We Know - The Moscow Times,English,Russia,"Russia and the United States held more than seven hours of tense talks in Geneva on Monday regarding Moscow’s sweeping set of demands from Washington and its NATO allies on their presence in Ukraine and other former Soviet countries. Both sides noted there was no breakthrough, but vowed to continue diplomatic efforts to diffuse tensions. Here’s what they discussed: – Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said he had assured his U.S. counterpart, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, that the fears of a Russian invasion of its pro-Western neighbor Ukraine were unfounded. – Sherman said Russia offered no proof it would not invade, nor any explanation for why it has deployed some 100,000 troops towards the Ukrainian border. – Sherman threatened sanctions on key Russian financial institutions, export controls targeting key industries, NATO enhancement and more security assistance to Kyiv if Russia invades Ukraine. – Ryabkov denounced the U.S. threats as ""attempts at blackmail and intimidation.” But he added: ""I don't think the situation is hopeless."" – Ryabkov sought “ironclad, legally binding” guarantees that Ukraine as well as the ex-Soviet republic of Georgia would never join the U.S.-led military bloc, saying the issue “is an absolute imperative” to Russia. – Sherman insisted that the demand is a ""non-starter,” saying “we will not allow anyone to slam closed NATO's open-door policy.” – Sherman offered reciprocal moves with Russia on de-escalation on missile placements and exercises. – Ryabkov reiterated Russia’s warning of a “military response through means at our discretion” if NATO deployed U.S. offensive weapons in Europe. “That will inevitably, unavoidably damage security of the U.S. and its European allies,” the AP quoted him as saying. – Ryabkov made clear that Russia was not interested in discussing the defunct INF Treaty, which had banned both sides from stationing short- and intermediate-range, land-based missiles in Europe, without the demands it has laid out in front of the U.S. and NATO. – Monday's talks in Geneva launched a week of “Strategic Security Dialogue” diplomacy between Russia and the West after Moscow's troop movements near Ukraine triggered a Cold War-style standoff. – A meeting of the NATO-Russia Council will take place in Brussels on Wednesday, then the permanent council of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) will meet in Vienna on Thursday with the issue of Ukraine expected to dominate. – The Kremlin called Monday's talks between the United States a ""positive"" start to continued dialogue, but noted that ""this is not a process for the sake of process... what's important here is the result. There is nothing to say yet about the result."" – Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko called the talks a ""moment of truth"" in Russia-NATO relations. ""Our expectations are entirely realistic and we hope that this will be a serious, deep conversation on key, fundamental problems of European security,"" Grushko said, referring to the talks in Brussels.

Meeting senior Kremlin envoys at their headquarters in Brussels, the NATO members said Moscow would have no veto on Ukraine or any other country joining the alliance, warning it would pay a high price if it invaded. ""Russia most of all will have to decide whether they really are about security, in which case they should engage, or whether this was all a pretext, and they may not even know yet,"" U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said. Putin's government has demanded the West to rule out accepting new members like Ukraine, Georgia or Finland on its eastern flank and has demanded limits on allied deployments in the former Soviet allies that joined NATO after the Cold War. Russia's massive troop build-up on Ukraine's borders has forced Washington to engage diplomatically — with bilateral security talks in Geneva on Monday, a NATO-Russia meeting on Wednesday and another planned at the OSCE in Vienna on Thursday. But the Western allies have received no promise that Russia will stand down its forces — which Moscow insists pose no threat to its already partially occupied neighbor — despite threatening massive economic sanctions if the Kremlin unleashes an invasion. Instead, the 30 member states invited the Russian envoys to return to Moscow and to advise Putin to join them for a series of confidence-building talks on limiting provocative military exercises, arms control and reciprocal limits on deploying missiles. ""Russia was not in a position to agree on that proposal. They didn't reject it either, but the Russian representatives made it clear that they needed some time to come back to NATO with an answer,"" alliance Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned: ""There are significant differences between NATO allies and Russia on these issues,"" he warned. Stoltenberg said it would be impossible for NATO members to agree to Moscow's core demands for a new security order in Europe, and in particular added that Russia would have no veto on Ukraine's right to eventually join the alliance. ""Ukraine as a sovereign nation... has the right to self-defense. Ukraine is not a threat to Russia,"" he said. ""It is Russia that is the aggressor. It is Russia that has used force and continues to use force against Ukraine. ""And then they're building up, with around 100,000 troops, artillery, armour, drones, tens of thousands of combat-ready troops and threatening rhetoric — that's the problem."" The West defends NATO's ""open-door policy"" towards potential future members, while Moscow is demanding a cast-iron guarantee that the alliance will not expand further towards its territory, seeing the westward tilt of one-time Warsaw Pact or Soviet allies as a threat. Before Wednesday, the NATO-Russia council had not met since 2019. NATO and Russia broke off practical cooperation in 2014 after Moscow occupied and annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea. Russia's diplomatic mission to the alliance was withdrawn in October last year after eight of its staff were expelled on allegations of espionage. But the former ambassador — now a deputy foreign minister — Alexander Grushko was back to confront Stoltenberg and Sherman, having earlier this week described the meeting as a ""moment of truth."" After the meeting, the senior U.S. diplomat said: ""Together, the United States and our NATO allies made clear we will not slam the door shut on NATO's open-door policy. ""NATO has never expanded through force or coercion or subversion. It is countries' sovereign choice to choose to come to NATO and say they want to join."" Just ahead of the talks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""The continuation of NATO's open-door policy and the further advancement of NATO towards our borders is precisely what, from our point of view, threatens us. ""This is exactly what we are asking not to continue through legally-binding guarantees."" The allies have threatened massive economic and financial sanctions against Moscow if its huge troop build-up on Ukraine's frontiers and in Russian-occupied Crimea turns into a new invasion. Peskov refused to be drawn on whether Russia could launch a military operation if denied. ""We would not like to throw around threats and ultimatums like American officials,"" he added. Russia has put intense pressure on Ukraine since 2014, after a revolution overthrew a government that had sided with the Kremlin against moving closer to Europe.

The Defense Ministry said 3,000 troops and 300 tanks and infantry fighting vehicles have been deployed across three western Russian regions bordering Ukraine and one bordering Belarus. The military’s Western Military District said the motorized rifle drills will involve T-72B3 main battle tanks and BMP-2 infantry fighting vehicles. The drills stretch across western Russia’s Voronezh, Belgorod, Bryansk and Smolensk regions. Late in December, Russia completed 10,000-troop drills across southern regions that included Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014. Russia’s announcement Tuesday — marking its second live fire exercises near Ukrainian borders in a month — came one day after Russian and U.S. diplomats held strategic security talks to try to de-escalate tensions. One of the key de-escalation issues offered by Washington was mutually limiting military exercises and deploying missiles in Europe. The U.S. State Department on Tuesday said Russia’s exercises go “in exactly the opposite direction” of de-escalation. The West has for months raised alarm over Russian military buildup near Ukraine and fears of a Russian invasion of its ally. Moscow denies planning an invasion and says moving troops and holding military drills within its borders is its right. The U.S. State Department said Russia offered no proof it would not invade or any explanation for why it has deployed some 100,000 troops toward the Ukrainian border. “These kind of deployments, 100,000 troops out of barracks and on the Ukrainian border, are extremely expensive,” Under Secretary of State Victoria Nuland said during Tuesday’s briefing. “As is the deployment of this kind of weaponry in the cold winter.” The Ukrainian president’s spokesman welcomed ""the intent and efforts of the United States and Russia, and NATO and Russia to reduce tensions and resolve all mutual issues at the negotiating table."" Monday’s negotiations in Geneva offered no breakthrough, with the next round of dialogue moving to NATO headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday.

",English,Russia,"Russia ruled out Sunday any concession at talks with the United States on soaring tensions over Ukraine, as Moscow, facing strong pressure to pull back troops, seeks a wide-ranging new security arrangement with the West. Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told Russian news agencies ahead of his talks in Geneva the Kremlin was ""disappointed"" with signals coming from Washington and from Brussels, where NATO and the European Union are based. The high-level discussions kick off a week of diplomacy in which Russia will meet with NATO and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), as the United States tries to assure European allies they will not be sidelined. Since late last year, Russia has amassed tens of thousands of troops at the Ukrainian border and demanded guarantees that NATO will not expand further eastward. The Kremlin is insisting NATO must never grant membership to ex-Soviet Ukraine, which is pushing to join. The United States, to be represented by Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, agreed to talks even though it made plain that many of Moscow's proposals are non-starters. Originally scheduled to start on Monday, Sherman is now due to have a working dinner with Ryabkov on Sunday evening, said a State Department spokesperson. Russia's Foreign Ministry posted footage of Ryabkov's plane arriving in Geneva. ""We will not agree to any concession. That is completely excluded,"" Ryabkov said before departing. ""We are disappointed with the signals coming in the last few days from Washington but also from Brussels."" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, dismissing Moscow's demands as ""gaslighting"", has insisted that talks will yield no progress so long as Russia has a ""gun to Ukraine's head."" ""We're prepared to respond forcefully to further Russian aggression. But a diplomatic solution is still possible and preferable if Russia chooses it,"" Blinken said Friday. Russian President Vladimir Putin met his US counterpart Joe Biden in Geneva in June and agreed on regular ""stability"" talks between Sherman and Ryabkov. In two phone calls to Putin, Biden has warned of severe consequences if Russia invades Ukraine. Measures under consideration include sanctions on Putin's inner circle, cancelling Russia's controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany or, in the most drastic scenario, severing Russia's links to the world's banking system. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, warned that Washington would also send more troops to eastern NATO members such as Poland and the Baltic states if Russia invaded Ukraine. Europeans have showed solidarity, with EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell visiting the frontline in Ukraine, although some nations are expected to hesitate at the strongest measures. ""Whatever the solution, Europe has to be involved,"" EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said. Russia insists it was deceived after the Cold War and understood that NATO would not expand. Instead, the U.S.-led alliance welcomed most of the former Warsaw Pact countries and the three Baltic nations that were under Soviet rule. Russia has put intense pressure on Ukraine since 2014 after a revolution overthrew a government that had sided with the Kremlin against moving closer to Europe. Russia seized the Crimean peninsula and backs an insurgency in eastern Ukraine in which more than 13,000 people have died. At a time when Russia is also intervening to shore up allies facing popular uprisings in Belarus and Kazakhstan, Moscow has insisted it wants concrete progress in talks with Washington. Putin's foreign policy adviser Yury Ushakov warned after the call with Biden that the United States would make a ""colossal mistake"" if it went ahead with sanctions. ""It is very likely that we will encounter the reticence of our U.S. and NATO colleagues to really perceive what we need,"" Ryabkov said Sunday. In spite ""of the threats that are constantly formulated against us ... we wil make no concession,"" he said, adding it would ""amount to acting against the interests of our seccurity."" NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg, meeting foreign ministers of the alliance on Friday, said there remained real risks of a Russian invasion. But John Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, described the Russian troop build-up as a ""gigantic bluff"" by Putin to seek a negotiated agreement. ""They are trying to see if the Biden administration or Europe will blink,"" said Herbst, now at the Atlantic Council think tank. ""As long as the Biden administration remains at least as strong as it is now,"" he said, ""it probably is enough to keep Putin from striking large into Ukraine, but I don't rule out something smaller.""

Putin delivered his annual holiday greetings hours after speaking with U.S. President Joe Biden, who warned the Russian leader of a “decisive” response to any invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin chief meanwhile cautioned Biden that sanctions would be a “colossal mistake” and lead to a collapse in Russian-U.S. relations. Pandemic toll Russia recorded more than 115,000 excess deaths during November 2021 according to official statistics published Thursday — a new record high since the start of the pandemic. The number takes Russia’s overall excess death count since the start of the pandemic to 929,000, according to The Moscow Times’ analysis. Calculations based on official statistics for January-November and preliminary data for December say Russia’s Covid-19 death toll is the second-highest in the world behind the United States. Foreign agents Russia on Thursday added members of the Pussy Riot protest group Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Nika Nikulshina, prominent satirist Viktor Shenderovich, independent journalist Taisiya Bekbulatova and former Kremlin advisor Marat Gelman to its registry of “foreign agents.” The Justice Ministry's registry now includes more than 100 entities and individuals, most of which were added in 2021 Tsirkon test The Russian Navy’s Northern Fleet said on Friday that it had carried out a 10th overall test of the Tsirkon hypersonic cruise missile from a frigate. The Russian military also test-fired the Tsirkon from a submarine twice during the testing phase, the Northern Fleet added. Fatal crash Five people died and 21 were injured in a bus accident near the village of Voslebovo in the Ryazan region south of Moscow on Sunday, Russian authorities said. The Federal Road Traffic Inspection agency published photographs of the badly damaged coach, which hit a pillar under a railway bridge. The front of the bus appeared to be entirely crushed. A website belonging to the Russian Interior Ministry said the driver could have fallen asleep behind the wheel.

According to the Levada Center pollster, 44% of Russian respondents said they expected the political situation to worsen in the coming months. Likewise, 49% said they expect the same for Russia’s economy. Only 18% and 16%, respectively, said they expected Russia’s political and economic life to improve in 2022. More than half of the respondents expressed skepticism toward the Russian government’s ability to improve the overall domestic situation, compared with two out of five who expressed confidence. When asked to assess Russia’s current political climate — which has seen an unprecedented crackdown on the non-systemic opposition over the past year — 47% of respondents called it “tense” and 12% called it “explosive.” Only 7% called the political situation “safe” and 32% called it “calm,” according to Levada. The independent polling agency’s results reflect the general mood among Russians as Moscow seeks to wrangle security concessions from the United States and NATO amid a post-Cold War freeze in relations. The U.S. warns of an imminent Russian invasion of Ukraine and has threatened tough sanctions, including on key Russian industries, in response. While Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine led to a surge in domestic approval for the country's leadership, it also sparked harsh sanctions from the West.

The high-stakes negotiations come amid fears of a Russian invasion of its pro-Western neighbor Ukraine, and with Moscow demanding wide-ranging concessions from Washington and its NATO allies. Monday's talks in Geneva launch a week of diplomacy between Russia and the West after Moscow amassed tens of thousands of troops at the Ukrainian border, drawing the United States into a Cold War-style stand-off. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov opened their meeting at the U.S. mission in Geneva at 8:55 a.m. (07:55 GMT). A convoy of black vehicles with Russian diplomatic plates had arrived shortly before, and was ushered through the large iron gates under a billowing U.S. flag. The two diplomats had already met informally in the Swiss city on Sunday evening, with Ryabkov afterwards telling Russian news agencies the first meeting had been ""difficult."" State news agency RIA Novosti on Monday quoted Ryabkov saying he feared Washington was not taking seriously Moscow's demand of an end to NATO's eastward expansion. Pointing to a 2008 promise by NATO to consider membership for Ukraine and others, Ryabkov said: ""Are they ready to give legal guarantees that this country, as well as other countries... will not join NATO?"" ""I have a rather pessimistic forecast in this regard."" Sherman said on Twitter that the talks were underway but there would be little progress without others at the table. ""The U.S. will listen to Russia's concerns and share our own, but we have been clear we will not discuss European security without our allies and partners,"" she said. Sherman in the talks on Sunday had stressed ""the freedom of sovereign nations to choose their own alliances,"" the State Department said. In the muddy trenches on the frontline in Ukraine, where Kyiv's forces have been battling pro-Russian fighters since 2014, there was little hope for diplomacy. ""I doubt that anything will change,"" 29-year-old soldier Mykhailo said as he walked through trenches in the town of Avdiivka, just north of the separatist stronghold city of Donetsk. ""Guarantees of not joining NATO will never stop"" Russian President Vladimir Putin, Mykhailo said, adding: ""He wants to return the Soviet Union in version 2.0."" Both sides have set firm lines, with Washington warning that Moscow would face severe diplomatic and economic consequences from an invasion of Ukraine, and Russia demanding wide-ranging new security arrangements with the West. After Monday's talks, a meeting of the NATO-Russia Council will take place in Brussels on Wednesday, then the permanent council of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) will meet in Vienna on Thursday with the issue of Ukraine expected to dominate. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken stressed Sunday that Russia had to choose between dialogue and confrontation, warning on CNN that there would be ""massive consequences for Russia if it renews its aggression on Ukraine."" Blinken warned that any positive outcome from the talks would rely in part on Russia's willingness to stand down from its aggressive posture, which he likened to ""an atmosphere of escalation with a gun to Ukraine's head."" Any direct military action by the United States or NATO in defense of Ukraine is extremely unlikely. But Western officials have warned Moscow would face significant economic and financial consequences if it invades, and could see NATO boost its presence and capacities near Russia's borders. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Monday that the alliance would be warning Russia of the ""severe costs"" of an invasion. He said he did not expect this week's talks to ""solve all the issues,"" but wanted to kickstart a diplomatic process. ""We are aiming for an agreement on a way forward, a process, a series of meetings,"" Stoltenberg said before talks with Ukraine's deputy prime minister in Brussels. Measures against Russia under consideration include sanctions on Putin's inner circle, canceling Russia's controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany or, in the most drastic scenario, severing Russia's links to the world's banking system. Moscow insists it was deceived after the Cold War and understood that NATO would not expand eastward. Instead, the U.S.-led alliance welcomed most of the former Warsaw Pact countries and the three Baltic nations that were under Soviet rule. Russia has put intense pressure on Ukraine since 2014 after a revolution overthrew a government that had sided with the Kremlin against moving closer to Europe. Russia seized the Crimean peninsula and backs an insurgency in eastern Ukraine in which more than 13,000 people have died. ""The Cold War is over, and so are spheres of influence,"" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted ahead of Monday's talks.

Here’s what we know about the NATO-Russia Council talks in Brussels: ‘No positive agenda’ – NATO rejected Russia's demand for a new security settlement in Europe, challenging President Vladimir Putin to withdraw troops deployed near Ukraine and join talks on reducing the threat of open conflict. – The Western allies received no promise that Russia will stand down its forces — which Moscow insists pose no threat to its already partially occupied neighbor — despite the threat of economic sanctions. – Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko said the “frank, direct, deep, intense” talks revealed “a large number of differences on fundamental issues.” – He said that Russia and NATO had no ""positive agenda — none at all"" and warned that the continued deterioration could lead to the ""most unpredictable and most dire consequences for European security.” Arms control – Grushko told reporters that Russia was ready for dialogue on not deploying intermediate-range missiles in Europe, mutual limits on military exercises and ways to prevent accidental encounters. – He pointed out that the confidence-building measures are included in Russia’s sweeping list of demands and proposals that forced Western allies to meet Russian envoys this week. – “The Russian side has repeatedly offered the alliance to take measures to de-escalate the situation. The Russian initiatives have been ignored by [NATO’s] side. This creates conditions for incidents and conflicts and undermines the foundations of security,"" the Defense Ministry said in a statement published by the state-run RIA Novosti news agency. Ukraine – Grushko called on NATO to stop sending military aid and arms supplies to Kyiv to de-escalate the current tensions. He maintained that Moscow's proposals, where a ban on Ukraine’s future NATO membership is a central tenet, could in fact improve security of both Russia and NATO members. – In response to NATO’s rejection of Russia’s demand to veto Ukraine’s membership aspirations, Grushko said that “the freedom to choose ways of ensuring one’s security mustn’t be implemented in a way that infringes on legitimate security interests of others.” Future talks – NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said “both Russia and NATO allies expressed the need to resume dialogue and to explore a schedule of future meetings.” – He said the U.S.-led alliance was ready to reopen its missions in Moscow four months after Russia suspended them in retaliation to NATO’s expulsion of Russian envoys over spying accusations. Putin invite – NATO invited the Russian envoys to return to Moscow and to advise Putin to join them for a series of confidence-building talks on limiting provocative military exercises, arms control and reciprocal limits on deploying missiles. – Stoltenberg said Russia’s envoys did not reject the offer. “Russia was not in a position to agree on that proposal…, but the Russian representatives made it clear that they needed some time to come back to NATO with an answer.” AFP contributed reporting.",1,502,96.6,44.78,13.14,17.9,26.42,32.87,79.48,53.78,39.84,5.98,1.59,0,0.2,0,0.8,0.6,4.38,13.35,7.17,0.6,16.14,3.39,0.8,3.78,1.79,10.16,5.58,4.38,8.96,2.59,1.39,5.18,8.17,1.2,6.77,1,1.79,1.39,0,0.2,1.79,0,4.58,2.19,2.39,0.2,0,0.2,0,0.2,0,0,14.94,11.55,2.39,0,1.99,0.4,5.38,4.18,0,0,0,0.8,5.78,3.98,1.79,0,2.99,0,0.4,2.39,0.2,0,0.6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.6,0.2,0.4,0,0,0,0,2.59,0.8,3.78,9.16,1.2,0.8,7.17,0.2,0,0.2,3.39,5.18,2.59,1.79,0.2,0,0.2,0,0,15.34,4.38,2.19,0,0,2.99,5.78

Russia’s military build-up on the Ukrainian border has set the world on edge, raising fears of an invasion. In neighboring Belarus, the Kremlin has moved closer to fully-fledged integration with the country, whose embattled strongman President Alexander Lukashenko looks increasingly isolated from the West. Looking west, the jailing of Kremlin-critic Alexei Navalny further strained relations with Europe, while across the Atlantic, the election of Joe Biden fundamentally changed the course of American foreign policy toward Russia. Russia also tried to extend its global footprint, by cooperating with post-coup Myanmar and Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. And as the world continued to struggle with the coronavirus pandemic, Russia attempted to boost its global image through “vaccine diplomacy,” but inconsistent vaccine production and a murky middle-man selling vaccines in the developing world ultimately led to a string of scandals that did Russia’s reputation more harm than good. What does Russia hope to achieve in 2022? The Moscow Times asked 10 leading experts in Russian foreign policy to give their predictions for the coming year. Russia-China relations will deepen in 2022 Alexander Gabuev, senior fellow and chair of the Russia in Asia-Pacific Program at the Carnegie Moscow Center Two years of the pandemic have shown the resilience of Russia-China ties. In 2021, trade volume grew to nearly $140 billion, setting another historic record. This figure reflects not only high commodities prices this year, but also increased shipments of natural gas via the “Power of Siberia” pipeline and growth in volumes of Russian coal exports to China. In 2022 this trend is likely to continue, although exact trade volumes will be subject to volatile global prices. As China shifts away from domestic coal to cleaner fuels like gas, and Russia seeks to monetize its natural resources, Moscow and Beijing might find more joint projects. Some of them will be unveiled during Vladimir Putin’s trip to Beijing in February, with a new contract for the “Power of Siberia 2” gas pipeline as the crown jewel. The political environment is also benevolent to the further deepening of China-Russia ties. Moscow’s conflict with the West is not going away, as demonstrated by recent events in Ukraine, raising the prospect of more U.S. and EU sanctions against Russia. Beijing’s confrontation with the U.S. is also here to stay, even if the White House gets distracted by events in Europe or elsewhere. Despite some predictions, China-Russia entente is far from its peak, and 2022 is likely to serve as another testament to this. Keeping the Middle East “stable in its instability” Mariana Belenskaya, Middle East correspondent for the Russian daily Kommersant ​​It seems that Russian foreign policy is no longer focused on the Middle East, as it was for several years after the start of the military campaign in Syria. Russia is now moving along a familiar path — the situation is “stable in its instability” but Moscow has restored its authority in the region, established ties and assigned roles. The general task for next year is to increase trade with the countries of the region — including by expanding the grain market — and maintaining interest in Russian weapons. Syria, which will remain Russia’s zone of responsibility for many years to come, is still a separate set of issues. It is important that the pacified territories do not once again turn into hotbeds of confrontation and that no global powers initiate new operations in the country. In addition, Russia hopes that Syria will gradually emerge from its international isolation. For its part, Moscow will continue trying to rebuild Syria’s infrastructure, at least to the extent that it can do so alone. Russia might need to pay close attention to Libya, where it remains unclear how events will develop. Moscow maintains close contact with all the parties in the Libyan conflict but does not seek a central role in resolving the problems there — at least for as long as the situation does not become critical. Two regional problems will require particular attention next year — the “Iranian nuclear dossier” and Afghanistan. The latter has become more strongly linked to the Middle East now that Turkey and Qatar have taken an interest in it. As for Iran, Moscow will do everything in its power to bring all parties back to the Iran nuclear deal — the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action — as it existed prior to Washington’s withdrawal from it in 2018. Indeed, the answer to the question of whether a Nuclear Deal 2.0 will appear and how it will look largely depends on how events will transpire in the Middle East and what role each party in the region will play. Peace in Ukraine is a victory in itself Andrei Kortunov, director-general of the Russian International Affairs Council It is hard to envisage a breakthrough or even significant progress in relations between Russia and Ukraine in 2022. The definition of success would be the ability of the sides to avoid direct military confrontation in Donbass, in the Azov Sea or along the Russian-Ukrainian border. The current political dynamic between Kiev and in Moscow is not conducive to the flexibility needed to move ahead with the implementation of the Minsk Agreements. At the same time, the change of government in Germany and the forthcoming presidential election in France make it very hard for the European members of the Normandy process to exercise the leadership needed to overcome the current stalemate. One could expect the Biden administration to become a more active player in the situation around Ukraine in 2022, but the odds are that White House attention will be focused on ongoing U.S.-China rivalry and the Ukrainian crisis will remain a relatively low priority for Washington. Still, de-escalation is possible, as well as a new Russian-Ukrainian agreement for gas transit. If these modest goals are achieved in 2022, we might see less hostile and belligerent rhetoric coming out of Moscow and Kiev. Further uneasy integration with Lukashenko in Belarus Artyom Shraibman, Belarussian journalist and political commentator for the Carnegie Moscow Center Russia's strategic goals in Belarus have remained unchanged for many years. Moscow, at minimum, wants to prevent the rapprochement of Minsk with the West, and at maximum, to strengthen its own influence in Belarus, which could outlive Alexander Lukashenko. Further institutionalization of such dependence will be the plan for 2022. This includes promoting bilateral integration within the Union State, increasing Russian military presence in Belarus, and “helping” Minsk to reorient its trade flows toward Russia in response to Western sanctions. Not all of those ambitions will necessarily materialize, as Lukashenko retains some bargaining power. For several years now, Moscow has been approaching financial support for Lukashenka conservatively. The volume of indirect subsidies, discounts on gas and oil and loans are either decreasing or not growing. The Kremlin gives Lukashenko as much as is necessary to keep his regime afloat, but the idea of more generous investment in Belarus has long been unpopular in Moscow. At the same time, one should not expect Putin to exert tough pressure on Lukashenko in order to speed up the transfer of power in Belarus. At best, the Kremlin might be ready to push the friendly regime toward controlled transformation, but Russians will not actively undermine Lukashenko’s rule. Moscow's long-standing problem with Belarus is the lack of reliable alternatives to Lukashenko. Despite Biden-Putin respect, Ukraine means a bumpy ride in relations with America Vladimir Frolov, political columnist and former Russian diplomat In 2022, the U.S. and Russia will test the resilience of the respectful adversarial relationship they have transitioned to after the Geneva summit last June. “The spirit of Geneva” has helped keep confrontation at an acceptable level through dialogue on strategic stability and cyber threats and with regular interaction between national security advisors. The presidential talks have demonstrated grudging respect and an ability to communicate grievances and threats clearly, but calmly, while opening new avenues for dialogue. Washington dangles inconclusive talks to curb Russian unpredictability, while Moscow views engaging with Biden as the best way to address Russia’s long-ignored concerns without changing course. There is even a rare U.S.-Russia mind-meld over the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) Iran nuclear deal negotiations, with Iran’s intransigence providing the incentives. Disagreements, however, will remain. The stand-off over bilateral diplomatic presence has degenerated into the grotesque, with spy agencies unable to agree on rules for acceptable espionage activity. Resolving the impasse will require Moscow to remove its designation of the U.S. as a “hostile power.” Ukraine, NATO enlargement and Russia’s rightful place in the European security order will remain the key battlegrounds in 2022. Moscow harbors great expectations after Biden’s promise to discuss Russia’s concerns over NATO enlargement “among the five major NATO allies” signaling acceptance of Moscow’s preferred format on European security. In Ukraine, Russia’s demands have moved beyond the implementation of the Minsk agreements and are now in “Finlandization territory.” Moscow’s insistence on legally binding guarantees of the definitive end to NATO enlargement in the former Soviet Union has narrowed the scope for face-saving diplomacy. Biden will have a short time frame in 2022 to negotiate an acceptable accommodation with Putin on Ukraine and European security. Russia’s posture is unlikely to change before significant diplomatic progress towards meeting Moscow’s objectives. It will be a rough ride. Crucial elections in Latin America could tilt the balance of power in Russia’s favor Vladimir Rouvinski, professor at Icesi University in Colombia In 2021, Russia managed to position itself as one of the major suppliers of the Covid-19 vaccine to the region, although mainly supporting countries with friendly relations to Moscow Meanwhile, key Russia ally President Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela, not only survived 2021 but also started strengthening his position in the region thanks to a new left-wing wave on the continent. In the coming year, Russia will be closely watching several important presidential elections, including Colombia, where a left-wing candidate is projected to be the likely winner. In Brazil, the very popular left-wing former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is expected to announce his bid for the presidency in early 2022. Wins for both left-wing candidates will dramatically change the Latin American political map and open new opportunities for Moscow to strengthen its ties in the Western Hemisphere. However, Russia also faces challenges. One of them is the shortage of tangible resources to support its allies in this part of the world. This is most evident in Cuba, where the situation is deteriorating rapidly and Moscow has so far provided minimal aid. The continuous tensions with Washington over Ukraine may incentivize reciprocity-driven Russia to pay more attention to Cuba, located just 129 kilometers (80 miles) from the U.S border. No easy answers in Europe Anton Barbashin, editorial director of Riddle Russia It is almost impossible, looking at the end of 2021, to see a bright future for EU-Russia relations in 2022. The best case scenario is that they won’t get much worse. We can point to three major themes that will define this relationship next year — Ukraine, Belarus and the future of gas. In each of these cases the EU’s goal is to minimize damage, while Russia will undoubtedly be ready to up the risk-taking, assuming the EU will be the first to blink. The most heated and potentially most devastating is the tension over Ukraine and the role of NATO in European security. While Moscow certainly blames Paris and Berlin for failing to press Minsk II and is now betting on Washington, it will be the EU that will have to pick up what’s left after the likely fallout. The blow might be softened by prompt Nord Stream 2 certification, but as of now it looks like stable gas prices are not in the basic scenario for 2022. Peaceful or not, 2022 will not be relaxing. Will the Arctic remain the sole region of cooperation in 2022? Elizabeth Buchanan, lecturer in strategic studies with Deakin University at the Australian War College Will 2022 mark the end of the Arctic’s “low tension” post-Cold War run or will the Arctic remain “isolated” from Russian-Western strategic tensions elsewhere? Pundits worldwide will no doubt keep a watchful eye on any potential spillover from Russia’s current Ukraine trajectory into the Arctic. Since 2014, Russian-Western ties in the Arctic have remained largely cooperative, indeed even collaborative via multilateral vehicles like the Arctic Council. Russia knows that the future economic resource base of the country does not rest on its Eastern European doorstep, but on its Arctic frontier. Plunging the Russian Arctic Zone into conflict is therefore not part of Russia’s strategic playbook. Working to silo the Arctic from tensions far beyond the region will remain a lynchpin of Kremlin security planning and outlook. The real geopolitical and strategic gains and achievements for Moscow in the Arctic will remain nested in Russia’s bilateral energy engagements. In 2022, I expect an enhanced diversification strategy with regard to Russia’s economic partners and stakeholders in its various Arctic energy ventures. Bilateral Arctic ties with India will be central to offsetting any Russian overreliance on Chinese capital. Russia will try to gain from the Taliban’s threat in Central Asia Temur Umarov, research consultant at Carnegie Moscow Center focusing on Central Asia In 2022, security concerns in Afghanistan will continue to be the priority for Moscow in Central Asia. Russia will see a window of opportunity to regain its reputation — which is being challenged by China — as the only reliable security guarantor in Central Asia against the uncertainties that the Taliban regime brings. This means that in the upcoming year Russia will intensify its cooperation with the security agencies in Central Asian nations. Russia will also be hoping to push through its integration projects with countries previously skeptical of joining. Uzbekistan, for instance, is now seriously considering joining the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union. Overall, Russia’s leadership will want to see a stable and safe Central Asia in the next several years. The closer we move toward 2024 presidential elections, the less energy the Kremlin will have for anything other than its domestic issues. Moscow will therefore try its best to help the political leaders in Central Asia to become stronger and more stable. However, this is not going to be an easy task, especially in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. More than symbolism at the 2022 Russia-Africa Summit Andrey Maslov, head of the Center for African Studies at Moscow's Higher School of Economics, with researcher for Intexpertise LLC Sviridov Vsevolod The volume of Russian-African trade increased this year for the first time since 2018, diversifying both geographically and in the range of goods traded. Shipments of railway equipment, fertilizers, pipes, high-tech equipment and aluminum are growing and work continues on institutionalizing the interaction between Russia and the African Union. The second Russia-Africa Summit is planned for 2022. In February it will be announced where and when it will be held — most likely in Russia in November — and in which format. Preparations for the second summit will shape the Russian-African agenda, visits will become more frequent and Africa will receive greater coverage in Russian media. Instead of measuring the success of the summit by how many African leaders attended, as happened in 2019, the parties will finally give greater attention to the substance of the agenda, which is already under development. Russia will try to increase its presence in Africa while avoiding direct confrontation with other non-regional players. A number of conflicts are also causing alarm, primarily those in Ethiopia and in Mali, from which France and the EU are withdrawing their troops. In 2022, Russia will try in various ways to play a stabilizing role for Africa and assist in confronting the main challenges it faces — epidemics, the spread of extremism and conflicts, and hunger. A dialogue will also begin on Africa formulating its own climate agenda. Africa is beginning to understand that it does not need a European-style green agenda and will demand compensation from the main polluting countries for the damage the climatic changes have caused to the ecosystems of African countries. Russia is likely to support these demands.",1,2686,95.99,27.84,53.59,39.79,24.2,31.09,79.08,57.86,45.31,3.95,0.56,0.04,0.11,0.04,0.11,0.22,3.39,13.1,8.45,2.01,17.42,6.44,2.94,5.17,0.86,10.2,8.23,3.46,6.66,1.23,2.08,3.46,8.75,0.3,8.41,1.45,0.93,0.86,1.68,0.48,3.09,0,4.69,3.02,1.68,0.82,0.3,0.52,0.15,0.34,0,0,5.25,3.28,1.01,0.19,0.82,0.11,0.67,1.6,0,0.04,0,0.11,4.36,2.57,1.6,0.19,3.43,0.26,0.15,2.23,0.93,0.11,0.6,0.37,0.34,0,0,0,0,0.04,0.04,0.48,0.19,0.3,0.07,0,0,0.45,0.74,0.04,3.43,12.62,0.56,1.04,10.13,0.78,0,0.37,3.83,1.19,3.54,3.76,0.07,0.04,0.04,0,0,12.96,4.54,4.36,0.11,0,1.23,2.72

Russia’s lead negotiator said he saw “no reason” to renew talks anytime soon, adding that the U.S. had shown no flexibility regarding Moscow’s demands to veto Ukrainian membership in the NATO alliance and roll back NATO’s troop and equipment deployments in central and eastern Europe. The ruble fell by almost 3% against the U.S. dollar following the comments, while Russia’s leading stock market lost more than 4% in ruble terms. The Russian currency was trading at 76.4 against the U.S. dollar on Thursday evening in Moscow, and had fallen to 87.6 against the euro. Russia’s dollar-denominated stock market, the RTS index, lost 6% with commodities companies among the biggest fallers. “The market has had its head in the sand about Russia-related geopolitical risks and is just waking up now,” said emerging markets bond trader Timothy Ash in a note to clients. Russian markets have been relatively quiet since the start of the year, despite the precarious security situation and comments from all sides that there is a serious risk of military escalation. Traders “may be realizing that Moscow is just going through the motions on the diplomatic front now but it is set on war,” Ash added. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said in an interview with the Russian-language channel RTVI that he was awaiting a substantive response from the West to draft treaties presented by Moscow at the end of last year before Moscow would contemplate another round of talks. “Another deterioration in the geopolitical situation has increased country risks and the corresponding discount in ruble assets,” said Dmitry Babin, stock market expert with Moscow-based brokerage BCS Investments. “Against this backdrop, the decline is likely to continue, at least in the short-term.” Also weighing on market sentiment Thursday was a draft U.S. bill outlining hard-hitting sanctions on the Russian economy that would result from Moscow taking further military steps against Ukraine. Moscow has hit back at Washington’s plans and ruled out calls to de-escalate the situation Thursday following the failure of high-level diplomatic talks earlier in the week. “Russia is not even ready to discuss the U.S.’ absolutely unacceptable demand for Russian troops to return to their barracks,” Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said, referring to calls from the U.S. for Moscow to withdraw some of the 100,000 troops it has stationed near the border with Ukraine. Talks between Moscow, Washington and NATO in Europe this week have failed to move the sides closer to a resolution of what Moscow has called “large and fundamental differences.” Moscow wants legal guarantees that NATO will never admit Ukraine as a member and has called for troop deployments across the alliance to be rolled back to 1997 positions, before the bloc expanded into eastern Europe. The U.S. has branded the proposals a “non-starter,” and high-level talks in Geneva and Brussels this week have not managed to bring the sides closer together.

The point is that they are talking, but are they speaking the same language? The mood music out of Geneva was as good as could have been expected in that the door is still open; although it is still unclear if anything will come through it. Moscow’s point man, First Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, said that “the conversation was difficult, long, very professional, deep, concrete, without attempts to embellish anything, to avoid any sharp corners,” but he allowed that “the American side took the Russian proposals very seriously.” On the specific issue of Ukraine, he said “we explained to our colleagues that we have no plans, no intentions, to ‘attack’ Ukraine … There is no reason to fear any escalation in this regard.” His U.S. counterpart, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, likewise characterized the talks as “serious” and “business-like,” but added “it is on Russia to de-escalate tensions,” which is at once true and yet also at the root of the problem. In part, this is about a fundamental disconnect between how Russia and the West see the situation. Washington wants to make this an issue of broader “strategic stability,” a route back into discussions about arms control and nuclear policy. Moscow is not specifically against this, but believes that talking about strategic stability in the present situation is like getting involved in comparison-shopping for burglar alarms when an intruder is already prising open the windows to your bedroom. It is an important but secondary and longer-term issue, to be resolved later, compared with an immediate threat from NATO. The West does not seem to be able to accept that — however nonsensical it may seem — the old men in the Kremlin truly do believe that NATO poses a threat, not necessarily in conventional military terms, but as a hostile alliance committed to constraining and even undermining Russia. This, after all, speaks to the arguably even more important point of the equally fundamental contrast between how the two sides feel about the situation and the talks. To Washington, these are pragmatic crisis talks to defuse a dangerous situation generated by the Kremlin’s unrealistic fears and ambitions. From some conversations I have had with people involved, the impression is of a police officer trying to negotiate a hostage situation. There is an innocent victim who has to be protected — Ukraine — there is a wild-eyed criminal with a knife at the victim’s throat — Russia — and there is the American cop, hoping to calm the miscreant, but with the threat of the SWAT team’s snipers at his back if things escalate. There may be some sad or traumatic backstory that made the knife-wielder what he is today, but that is not really the cop’s concern. For Moscow, I feel these are more like divorce negotiations at the end of a long, increasingly bitter marriage. On one level, the Kremlin may know that it is acting out, but it feels it has no alternative way of getting through to its smug, dishonest ex-partner, who cheated and lied, yet still believes it has a legitimate claim to both the kids and the beach house, as well as to feel morally superior for whatever pittance they leave in the settlement. In this context, the problem is precisely that negotiations over practical issues become intertwined with the psycho-drama of years of growing animosity. The breach of promises made to Gorbachev that NATO would move not an inch eastwards, Kosovo, Libya, the way the European Union Accession Agreement would practically, if not technically, preclude Ukraine’s membership of the Eurasian Economic Union — all these are not simply past bones of contention. For the Kremlin leadership they demonstrate a pattern of wilful deception that explains its impractical demands for “iron-clad” legal guarantees, not just verbal commitments. Western attempts to argue these cases, to challenge Moscow’s understandings of them or to consider them historical incidents of no current bearing, are thus regarded as gaslighting, equivalent to the unfaithful ex-spouse waving away past affairs as “ancient history” and seeking to limit any negotiations to the issues that suit them. Tellingly, for example, Ryabkov complained that the U.S. wanted to restore the work of the Russia-NATO Council, suspended since 2019, but “on their own terms, to an agenda that suits them, with an emphasis on so-called “Russian aggression” in Ukraine. To him, the attempt to define the parameters of any discussion was in itself an aggression. On one level, these may seem trivial analogies to draw, but the hope is that they convey the gulf between not just what each side is saying, but how they feel about the dispute. That is not to say there is no room for hope. The U.S. side seems to have avoided the temptation to respond to a recitation of Russian complaints in kind, but made an effort to talk them through. It also did not make any continuation of the discussions tightly dependent on immediate demands about a scaling down of the forces on the Ukrainian border or the like. Instead, it seems willing to give the conversation time — which is crucial to get through the opening bluster and at the very least let the Russians feel they are being heard. It’s less clear how far Moscow is willing to let the talks run if it doesn’t get the sense that there is any room for concrete progress on the one issue it seems to think is more important than all the rest: Ukraine, both in terms of NATO membership and also the potential for it to be used, even while not a member, as a base for Western military assets. The kinds of proposals Sherman has been able to put on the table so far — such as the deployment of missile defence systems in Europe and limits on military exercises — do not in any way add up to anything that Putin could consider a victory. Although we should not overstate the degree to which Putin is committed to the point that his choice is simply between “win or war,” an authoritarian regime has more scope to spin concessions as statesmanship. While the Russian people are not clamouring for conflict, he must see this as a crucial moment in his consistent efforts to redefine a European security order he feels is unfairly tilted against Russia. Ryabkov has made it clear that Russia wants NATO openly to repudiate its membership pledge to Ukraine and Georgia at its next summit, in Madrid. As that is not until June, it means there may be time yet for talk. Admittedly, at present, it is hard to see how any amount of discussion could bridge the gap between Russia and the West. The virtue of dialogue, though, is that new ideas and shared understandings can sometimes come from the back-and-forth. And with a reported 100,000-plus Russian troops on or near the Ukrainian border, and a system that has spent seven years doing everything it can to sanctions-proof itself to the point where it may credibly believe it can shrug off the “unprecedented sanctions” the West has threatened, dialogue is also better than the alternative.",1,1230,83.91,25.99,38.45,9.92,32.37,25.93,86.1,68.46,54.96,8.86,2.6,0.16,0.33,0.08,0.81,1.06,6.26,16.99,9.67,0.73,16.26,7.56,4.88,6.18,1.95,14.72,5.93,2.93,5.61,1.38,1.38,2.93,16.42,1.14,15.2,3.25,1.79,1.71,3.98,1.22,5.04,0,4.23,1.54,2.6,1.3,0.41,0.81,0.16,0.41,0.08,0,10.41,6.5,0.24,0.16,1.46,0.73,2.76,4.15,0.16,0,0,0.98,2.85,1.87,0.89,0.08,2.2,0.16,0.41,1.3,0.33,0.08,0.41,0.08,0,0,0.08,0,0,0,0,0.33,0.57,0.49,0,0,0,0.08,0.89,0,4.15,8.86,0.16,0.73,6.83,0.24,0.16,0.89,3.01,2.52,6.67,1.71,0,0,0,0,0,14.88,3.58,6.34,0.08,0,1.06,3.82

S . ",English,Russia,"The United States’ plans to levy sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin would be an “extreme” step that would signify a complete breakdown in ties between the two countries, the Kremlin said Thursday. U.S. senators, with support from the White House, unveiled a package of hard-hitting sanctions Wednesday evening intended to “devastate” the Russian economy should Moscow invade Ukraine. Among the measures would be personal sanctions against Putin, as well as several other top officials including Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. Sanctioning a head of state and other leading officials would be a rare move, as the U.S. has previously restricted its sanctions packages to lower-level officials. “Introducing sanctions against the head of the government or the head of Russia is an extreme measure which is comparable to a breakdown in relations,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in a briefing, according to the state-run TASS news agency. “What is Russia ready to do? Russia is always ready and will always do what is in the best interests of our country,” he added. Under the draft legislation, the U.S. government would also be required to investigate and publish a report into the personal wealth and assets of Putin, his family members and any other people the U.S. believes to hold assets on his behalf. Due to the U.S.’ leading role in the world economy, personal sanctions effectively prohibit individuals from traveling to or from accessing property and bank accounts held in most Western countries. Talks between Moscow, Washington and NATO in Europe this week have so far failed to move the sides closer to a resolution of what Moscow has called “large and fundamental differences.” Moscow wants legal guarantees that NATO will never admit Ukraine as a member and has called for troop deployments across the alliance to be rolled back to 1997 positions, before the bloc expanded into eastern Europe. The U.S. has branded the proposals a “non-starter,” and high-level talks in Geneva and Brussels this week have not managed to bring the sides closer together. Peskov on Thursday rejected NATO’s calls for Russia to de-escalate the situation by pulling back the estimated 100,000 troops that have been deployed close to the Ukrainian border. “It’s hardly possible that NATO can dictate to Russia where it should move troops on its own territory,” he said.",1,389,94.35,50.78,26.46,23.48,27.79,29.56,84.32,58.1,45.5,4.88,1.29,0,0.26,0,1.03,0,3.6,14.65,10.03,0.77,15.17,7.97,2.06,5.4,0.51,13.37,6.68,2.06,9,2.06,1.54,5.91,9.77,0.77,9,1.03,0.26,2.31,1.54,0.26,3.08,0,2.31,1.29,1.03,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.03,4.88,0.77,0,0.51,0,2.57,5.14,0,0,0,1.29,9.25,8.48,0.77,0,3.34,0,0.26,1.8,1.8,0,0.51,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.26,0.26,0,0,0.26,0,0,0,0.26,3.34,10.8,0.26,2.06,8.23,0.26,0,0,3.6,2.83,3.86,1.8,0,0,0,0,0,16.97,6.43,4.11,0.26,0,1.03,5.14

The United States and Russia had set firm lines ahead of the high-stakes security talks on Ukraine, with Washington warning of the risk of confrontation and Moscow ruling out concessions. A full day of talks was to follow Monday. Kazakhstan unrest Russia has evacuated nearly 1,500 of its nationals from Kazakhstan, said Moscow's Defense Ministry, which leads a regional military alliance that has been deployed to quell anti-government protests in the ex-Soviet Central Asian republic. Kazakhstan’s interior ministry said almost 8,000 people have been detained following a week of unrest. Its information ministry initially reported — before retracting its statement — that 164 people had died across the country during the violence. Trading barbs The U.S. and Russia traded barbs over the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization’s (CSTO) deployment to Kazakhstan, whose “peacekeeping” mission authorities expect will wrap up in one week. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said “one lesson of recent history is that once Russians are in your house, it’s sometimes very difficult to get them to leave.” Russia’s Foreign Ministry hit back with references to past U.S. invasions of other countries, saying “when Americans are in your house, it can be difficult to stay alive, not being robbed or raped.” ‘Gateway to Hell’ Turkmenistan's strongman leader has ordered experts to find a way to finally extinguish a massive five-decade old fire in a giant natural gas crater in the Central Asian country, dubbed the ""Gateway to Hell.""

A senior Russian diplomat hinted that it might as well as he sang the praises of Kanye West, known simply as Ye, and the influential Russian rapper Oxxxymiron. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov divulged his musical tastes at the end of a week of security talks with the United States, NATO and Europe’s top security body OSCE that ultimately fell short of resolving deep-rooted geopolitical tensions. “If Oxxxymiron’s rap could be layered on Mr. West’s music, that would probably be good,” Ryabkov said in an interview with the Russian-language international broadcaster RTVI on Thursday. “Oxxxymiron’s lyrics are amazing in their depth, in my view they’re better listened to and studied without the musical background,” he elaborated. “And Mr. Ye — he was always experimenting with music,” the Russian diplomat added. “Even now, there’s harmony in his compositions, if you remove some aspects of modern processing… If you listen to Mr. West abstractly, there are some things you can play on the balalaika, the piano and the harp.” One other unexpected bit of news from this Ryabkov interview: turns out he is a huge fan of Lady Gaga, Russian rapper @norimyxxxo, and Kanye West, who he refers to as “Mister Ye” in a detailed discussion of his work pic.twitter.com/p8Ex8G8E9F TikTok users immediately took up the challenge and created a mashup of Oxxxymiron’s lyrics and Ye’s music. In the RTVI interview, Ryabkov also revealed that his favorite artist was Lady Gaga. “I think she is unique in every way — as a composer, as a singer, and as an actress,” he gushed. Ryabkov’s unexpected appreciation for popular music follows the footsteps of former Kremlin aide Vladislav Surkov, who has openly shared his affinity for the poetry of the late rapper Tupac. But the pop culture digression did not distract from the bleak reality that Russia and the West remained at odds over European security. Following three sessions with the U.S., NATO and the OSCE in three European capitals, Ryabkov told RTVI he sees no reason to “gather again and start the same discussions.” He did not rule out Moscow sending troops to Cuba and Venezuela in response to what the Kremlin perceives as the U.S. threatening its security with troops and missiles near Russian borders. The United States and NATO rejected Moscow’s demands to withdraw their troops from Eastern Europe and for ex-Soviet Ukraine and Georgia never to be admitted into the U.S.-led military alliance. The West has warned that an estimated 100,000 Russian troops and equipment amassed at the border with Ukraine signaled an “imminent” invasion, which the Kremlin denies.",1,437,86.8,80.26,13.84,32.97,27.31,26.77,81.46,59.5,46.68,8.92,6.18,0.46,0,1.37,3.2,0.69,2.75,14.65,9.15,1.14,13.96,4.58,3.43,7.09,0.92,10.53,5.26,2.75,4.58,1.37,1.14,2.06,9.15,0.92,8.24,2.06,0.92,0.69,1.37,0.46,2.75,0,3.66,2.29,1.37,0.69,0.69,0,0,0,0,0,15.1,6.18,0.69,1.37,0.46,0,2.97,10.07,0,0,0.92,3.89,5.49,3.43,2.06,0,4.58,2.75,0,1.83,0,0,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.23,0,0,0,0.69,0.46,0,0,0,1.37,0.23,2.06,11.67,0.69,0.23,7.32,0.69,2.29,0.23,3.2,4.58,3.89,0.69,0.46,0.46,0,0,0,19.68,6.18,5.49,0.23,0,2.29,5.49

Almaty, the country's former capital, had been nearly completely offline since Wednesday, but local and foreign websites were accessible again Monday morning, following the worst unrest in the ex-Soviet republic's independent history. The Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), a Moscow-led regional military bloc that has dispatched peacekeeping troops to the country, was set to hold an online summit on the crisis Monday, with the Kremlin confirming Russian President Vladimir Putin's attendance. AFP correspondents saw public transport on the streets of Almaty for the first time since protests descended into violence earlier this week, leaving strategic government buildings burned and gutted and businesses counting the costs of a looting spree. Lyudmila, a pensioner who was waiting for a bus in the city center and gave only her first name, said she was alerted to the internet's reappearance by a messenger call from relatives in Ukraine. ""I had no idea that we were back online again,"" she said. She told AFP that during clashes on Wednesday night, injured soldiers had been dragged into the courtyard of the apartment building where she lived for emergency treatment. Kazakhstan has framed the violence in Almaty as an attack by ""terrorist groups"" and expressed displeasure at foreign media coverage of the events, which began with protests over a fuel price hike in the west of the country on Jan. 2. On Monday the government said foreign media reports had created ""the false impression that the Kazakhstan government has been targeting peaceful protestors."" ""Our security forces have been engaging with violent mobs who were committing brazen acts of terror,"" the foreign ministry said in the statement. But the authoritarian government has also struggled to firm up its own narrative. On Sunday evening the information ministry retracted a statement that had appeared in an officially run Telegram channel earlier that said more than 164 people had died in the unrest. Two private websites that had reported the news said the information ministry had told them the statement was the result of a ""technical mistake."" Officials previously said 26 ""armed criminals"" had been killed and that 16 security officers had died. In total, 5,800 people have been detained for questioning, the presidency said in a statement on Sunday. Nur-Sultan, the city that replaced Almaty as capital in 1997 and which was renamed in honor of 81-year-old founding president Nursultan Nazarbayev in 2019, saw comparatively little unrest. The crisis comes with tensions between Moscow and the West at post-Cold War highs over fears of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, with talks between Russia and the U.S. to take place in Geneva on Monday after a working dinner on Sunday evening. Russia has ruled out any concessions at the talks. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has thanked the Moscow-led CSTO for answering his request for help and sending a detachment of 2,500 troops to the country. Tokayev says the deployment will be temporary, but U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned on Friday that ""once Russians are in your house, it's sometimes very difficult to get them to leave."" While the precise contours of the political crisis that engulfed Kazakhstan are unclear, it is evident that the ruling elite has been roiled. On Saturday, authorities announced the arrest on treason charges of Karim Masimov, a high-profile Nazarbayev ally who was dismissed from his post as security committee chief at the height of the unrest. Nazarbayev, who was widely regarded as holding the strings in the oil-rich Central Asian country despite stepping down from the presidency in 2019, has not spoken in public since the crisis began. Nazarbayev's press secretary said on Twitter Saturday that Nazarbayev was in ""direct contact"" with Tokayev and called on Kazakhs to ""rally around"" the president. Nazarbayev hand-picked Tokayev as his successor after calling time on more than a quarter-century as head of state. Tokayev's spokesman said Sunday that he was ""taking decisions independently...not running to consultants.""",1,687,96.18,54.81,43.19,1.9,25.44,31.44,82.82,58.37,44.98,5.82,2.77,0.15,0.29,0.15,1.31,0.29,3.06,14.99,10.19,2.47,16.45,6.84,1.89,4.8,0.44,13.68,6.11,2.77,6.4,1.16,0.73,4.37,5.39,0,5.09,0.87,0.73,0.15,1.02,0.15,2.04,0,4.08,0.58,3.49,0.73,0,0.73,0.29,0.15,0.15,0,10.92,5.53,0.44,0.44,0.73,0.44,3.93,4.66,0.15,0.15,0.73,0.73,6.26,3.93,1.31,1.02,2.77,0.15,0.29,1.89,0.73,0,1.16,0.15,0,0,0,0,0,0.15,0.73,0.73,0,0.44,0,0,0,0,1.46,0.15,3.78,10.48,0.44,1.31,8.3,0.87,0,0.15,5.97,9.61,2.33,0.15,0,0,0,0,0,15.43,5.09,4.22,0,0,1.16,4.95

Prices for gas have soared this winter in Europe, with wholesale prices standing five times higher than last year in a number of countries. Moscow has been blamed for withholding shipments to Europe during a cold snap last year and keeping gas storage facilities low. The Kremlin and Gazprom, Russia’s monopoly gas exporter, have denied any wrongdoing, and said Europe should have struck multi-year contracts if it wanted to secure stable energy supplies, rather than relying on short-term market prices. Fatih Birol, director of the influential IEA, said Wednesday that Russia could boost gas supplies by at least a third but is choosing not to. “There are strong elements of tightness in the European gas market due to Russia’s behavior,” Bloomberg quoted Birol as saying. “The current storage deficit in the European Union is largely due to Gazprom.” It calculated Russian supplies to Europe were down 25% from 2020 levels in the fourth quarter of 2021, and were 22% below pre-pandemic levels. The IEA is an organization which represents 30 major economies, most European, and advises them on global energy policies. Russia is not a member. With gas prices at record highs across the continent, the IEA pointed out that Gazprom would stand to benefit from increasing supplies to Europe and selling more on the so-called spot market, but is instead refusing to do so. The criticism renews a bitter war of words between Russia, the EU and U.S. over whether Russia is abusing its role as Europe’s main energy supplier to secure final approval for its controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline. That initiative, led by Russia’s Gazprom, has been thrown into new uncertainty in recent days, with U.S. officials saying it would work to block the pipeline from ever going live if Russia invades Ukraine. Sweden became the latest individual country to criticize Russia’s gas policies Wednesday. The Scandinavian country’s energy minister set aside more than $600 million in government funds to help households deal with rising energy costs and said Russia was partly to blame for the high prices and economic hardship.",1,371,95.37,26.87,25.87,5.02,24.73,25.88,75.47,54.72,41.24,3.23,0.27,0,0,0,0,0.27,2.96,10.78,6.74,2.96,16.44,5.93,1.89,5.93,0.54,10.24,6.2,7.01,4.58,0.54,0.54,3.5,7.55,0.27,7.01,0.27,0.27,1.35,1.62,0,3.23,0,5.12,1.62,3.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.55,5.66,0.54,0,1.89,1.08,2.43,1.35,0.27,0,0,0,2.16,1.35,0.81,0,7.28,0,0.27,3.23,3.77,0,0.27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.27,0.27,0,0.27,0,0,0.27,0.81,0,2.96,8.89,0.54,0.81,6.74,0,0,0.81,4.85,3.77,3.23,0.27,0,0,0,0,0,14.82,5.12,4.58,0,0,1.62,3.5

Putin's remarks came days after 2,500 Russian, Belarusian, Armenian, Tajik and Kyrgyz troops were deployed across Kazakh cities to defend key state facilities as part of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) alliance. “We will not allow the realization of so-called color revolution scenarios,” Putin said during Monday's videoconference of CSTO members, according to the state-run RIA Novosti news agency. He accused unidentified “outside forces” of interfering “in the internal affairs of our states,” echoing the Kazakh authorities’ latest claims of foreign links in the unrest. “They used well-organized and well-controlled militant groups… including those who had obviously been trained in terrorist camps abroad,” Putin said, calling Kazakhstan the target of “international terrorism.” Putin also stressed that the CSTO forces would only remain in Kazakhstan for a ""limited"" time period. Russian officials and pro-Kremlin media have blamed the West for trying to foment a “color revolution” in Kazakhstan — a similar reprise voiced during popular uprisings in ex-Soviet Georgia, Ukraine and Belarus in recent years. Speaking at the CSTO summit, Kazakhstan’s President Kassym Jomart-Tokayev called the week of violence “an attempted coup d’etat.” The Kremlin also criticized the role of social media in fueling the unprecedented protests in Kazakhstan. “Social networks obviously have both good and harmful elements. The task is to take measures to stop the harmful side,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday. “This is not new, it’s just once again been confirmed by the recent events in Kazakhstan.” Authorities in Kazakhstan shut down internet access across the country amid the nationwide protests last week, with access still limited in major cities for days after the unrest. Putin has been a longtime critic of social media’s potential for influencing young people and has recently taken more aggressive steps to limit the kind of content that can be shared online, slapping multimillion dollar fines on the likes of Google and Facebook, for instance, for refusing to remove content linked to Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration has dismissed claims that it was behind the unrest. Oil- and uranium-producing Kazakhstan has been left reeling in the wake of unprecedented unrest that erupted earlier this month in the midst of protests over a fuel price hike in the west of the country. Dozens have been killed in the unrest and the interior ministry said earlier Monday that nearly 8,000 people had been detained in operations executed by several branches of the security services.

Alongside Russia, CSTO member states Armenia, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan sent troop contingents to Kazakhstan, an important regional power with vast energy resources and a founding member of the Eurasian Economic Union, a Russia-led regional trade bloc. Tokayev said that intervention was necessary to counter a “terrorist threat” after protests against a fuel price hike spread nationwide, with demonstrators in Kazakhstan’s commercial capital Almaty seizing weapons, setting government buildings alight and shutting down the country’s main international airport. Kazakh media have reported that at least twelve police officers have been killed during the unrest, with “dozens” more fatalities reported. On Thursday morning, footage circulated on social media showed Kazakh army units exchanging gunfire with armed opponents as they attempted to retake Almaty. For many Russian observers, the sudden explosion of unrest in a country otherwise known for political stability, underlines a sense that intervention — which until only hours before Tokayev’s plea for help had been sworn off by the Kremlin — was unavoidable. “I don’t think Russia had any choice but to intervene,” said RIAC’s Kortunov, who pointed to a 2020 revolution in Kazakhstan’s Central Asian neighbor Kyrgyzstan, and last year’s Taliban takeover in Afghanistan. “Given how violent the unrest was and how unstable the region is, this seems like it was the only option,'' he added. “But it’s important that this is a short, time-limited operation and that we don’t get sucked in. The crisis in Kazakhstan comes at an awkward time for Russia. With tensions with the West on the rise amid a months-long military buildup on the Ukrainian border and fears of war, Russian has moved westward many of the units it usually deploys in Siberia and the Urals, along its frontier with Kazakhstan. As reports of unrest spread across Kazakhstan on Wednesday, parts of the pro-Kremlin media labeled the events a “Maidan”, referring to the 2014 revolution in Ukraine that touched off that country’s break with Russia, and accused the West of contriving the disturbances ahead of high-stakes U.S.-Russia talks this month. Tokayev likewise claimed that his country was under “external attack” from “bands of terrorists.” However, with Russia’s armed forces heavily engaged along the Ukrainian border, and much of its diplomatic capacity given over to ongoing talks with the U.S. on security guarantees, the Kazakhstan crisis represents an unwelcome turn of events for Moscow. “The Kremlin needs to divide [its] attention … and manage strategic instability on two fronts,” Alexander Baunov, a Russian foreign policy analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Center think tank, wrote on Twitter. For some experts, the biggest potential risk is Russia’s getting sucked into Kazakhstan’s domestic disputes. Though Kazakhstan has a large Russian majority, and the country’s north has sometimes been the object of irredentist dreams, Russo-Kazakh relations have been generally friendly since the end of the U.S.S.R. With Russia now assuming a leading role in underwriting Kazakhstan’s government, RIAC’s Kortunov fears an outpouring of Kazakh nationalism and disruption of the country’s fragile internal ethnic balance. Previous Russian interventions in post-Soviet countries have seen friendly states take sharp anti-Russian turns, Kortunov noted. “There’s a real chance that we could see the rise of anti-Russian sentiment in Kazakhstan, along the lines of Ukraine or Georgia,” he said. The crisis in Kazakhstan is also likely to impinge on Russia’s domestic politics. Though both countries have been largely stable under long-standing authoritarian regimes, widespread economic frustrations and inequality have eaten away at both governments’ popular standing. In Russia, as in Kazakhstan, unpopular socio-economic reforms including a 2018 pension age increase, and wage stagnation have driven down the president’s once sky-high approval rating. A recent Levada Center poll showed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s electoral rating — the number of Russians ready to vote for his re-election — at 32%, a record low. “Putin generally does believe in his own popularity,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of R.Politik, a political consultancy firm. “But the events in Kazakhstan could make him doubt how sustainable that popularity really is.” For some opposition-minded Russians, recalling how the outbreak of unrest in Belarus in summer 2020 presaged an unprecedented crackdown at home, events in Kazakhstan bodes ill for Russian liberties. “We’ll be the ones to pay for the Kazakhs’ freedom,” wrote Kirill Martynov, deputy editor of Russia’s independent Novaya Gazeta newspaper, on Twitter, predicting a crackdown by Russian security services fearing copycat protests across the border. For others, the protests in Kazakhstan — which were in large part directed against Nursultan Nazarbayev, the country’s founding president who resigned in 2019 but still retains extensive behind-the-scenes powers — could influence Vladimir Putin’s choice on whether to stay in office or not. After Nazarbayev — who is personally close to Putin — departed from the presidency to head his country’s powerful Security Council, some observers suggested that the Russian president might eventually follow the Kazakh model, by handing over day-to-day responsibilities to a hand-picked successor while retaining ultimate control. However, the outpouring of rage against the man who has led Kazakhstan since it was part of the Soviet Union, including scenes of a Nazarbayev statue in the city of Taldykorgan being felled by protesters, may lead Putin to conclude that loosening his grip on power is dangerous. Tokayev’s Wednesday announcement that he was taking over the country’s Security Council, displacing his erstwhile patron, only underlines the risks of any handover of power. “Kazakh events make [the] Kazakhstan power transit scenario virtually impossible for Russia,” wrote Carnegie’s Baunov. “Now Putin will hardly be inclined to leave his position to a successor.”",1,1018,96.89,44.12,35.09,4.7,27.51,34.68,78.09,54.32,41.94,4.81,2.06,0.2,0.29,0,1.08,0.1,2.75,13.06,8.74,1.08,16.6,5.21,2.65,4.32,0.29,10.71,5.6,3.54,6.88,1.67,0.79,4.91,8.84,0.2,8.64,1.67,1.77,0.49,2.06,0.39,2.95,0.1,3.24,0.59,2.55,0.88,0.2,0.59,0.29,0.29,0,0,8.15,3.73,0.59,0.2,1.08,0.1,1.87,3.83,0,0,0,1.18,8.25,3.73,4.32,0.2,3.14,0.1,0.29,1.87,0.98,0.1,0.49,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1,0.2,0.49,0,0.39,0,0,0,0,1.28,0,2.55,9.82,0.1,1.47,7.47,0.39,0.1,0.49,3.83,4.22,2.95,1.18,0.2,0.2,0,0,0,20.83,4.52,6.58,0,0,3.44,6.29
