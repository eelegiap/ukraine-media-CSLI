The Ministry of Defence - which shared pictures of the soldiers - described them as ""the despicable 10"". Prosecutors say they are being investigated for ""premeditated murder"". They are also accused of holding innocent civilians hostage, beating them and looting homes. Moscow has denied any crimes were committed in Bucha, which was under the control of the 64th motorised infantry brigade for more than a month at the start of the war. Russia's President Vladimir Putin gave the brigade an honorary title - recognising what he says was ""mass heroism and valour, tenacity and courage"" - on its return home. But in the time the brigade controlled Bucha, hundreds were killed. A mass grave was discovered at the church after the town's liberation, while bodies had been left lining the streets where they fell. Thousands of war crimes were documented by investigators. One of those who survived, Vitaliy Zhyvotovskyi, recalled the screams he heard to news agency AFP. ""We had no hope,"" he said, remembering how they used to tremble ""not because of the cold, but due to fear because we could hear what the Russians did to the captives"". On Thursday, Ukraine's prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova announced they had identified the 10 suspects in particular, sharing pictures of the young men. In a Facebook post, she explained they ""are suspected of cruel treatment of civilians and other violations of laws and customs of war"". ""The suspects will be declared wanted in order to detain them and bring them to justice,"" the statement added, appealing for any other information. Stephen Wilkinson, the manager of the Diakonia International Humanitarian Law Centre in Sweden, points out that the chance of a successful prosecution is quite low if they are in Russia. However, the 64th motorised infantry brigade is now back Ukraine, having moved east to Izium - on the frontline of the battle for the Donbas region. According to reports, it has suffered heavy losses. If the 10 are still with the brigade - and still alive - it is not impossible they will be found and tried. Indeed, back in 2014, Ukraine successfully prosecuted two Russian soldiers for ""terrorism"" after they were captured in the east. They were later handed back to Russia in a prisoner exchange. ""Domestic prosecutions are often the best and quickest way,"" Mr Wilkinson adds, despite the focus on international mechanisms such as the International Criminal Court in the Hague. The fact they are ""foot soldiers"" rather than commanders may also make prosecution easier, Mr Wilkinson says - although ""that doesn't remove the need to look into criminal responsibility of the commanders"". Watch: UN chief stands outside destroyed buildings near Kyiv, calling the war ""an absurdity in the 21st century"" However, there are elements of the Ukrainians fight for justice which have raised some cause for concern for Mr Wilkinson. In particular, the way the photos have been distributed online. ""Even if you know there is strong evidence, the law states innocent until proven guilty. What about a free and fair trial? There is a lot of emotion behind this. I would say it puts it at risk, although doesn't fundamentally undermine it."" It has also emerged that an earlier list of the brigade released by Ukrainian authorities may have included a number of names of people from Tajikistan who were no longer serving in the unit. ""It is not known how many Tajiks in the brigade were in Ukraine, but eight Tajiks, whose names were mentioned in the list, and their relatives claim that they were not there,"" Radio Liberty's Tajik Service Ozodi said.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson accused Russia of ""despicable attacks"" on Ukrainian civilians in Bucha and another town, saying his country would not rest until justice was served for the victims. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken described the images of corpses in Bucha as a ""punch to the gut"" and the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said an independent investigation was urgently needed. Ukraine's president, Volodomyr Zelensky, accused Russia of committing genocide. Russia's defence ministry countered by suggesting the scenes in Bucha had been faked by the Ukrainian government. Fighting continued, with Russia launching missiles at the Black Sea port of Odesa and other targets in central and southern Ukraine, and reported Russian shelling of the city of Kharkiv. A story in the UK about a threat to sunflower oil supplies - Ukraine and Russia are major producers - brought home the spreading economic impact of the conflict. ""I went into the kitchen and saw a bomb coming towards my window. It was all so quick I didn't know what was happening. I just saw it flying towards me."" It was the morning of 11 March in the eastern Ukrainian region of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, when a bomb crashed into Olena Selichzianowa's home - and her family. Speaking in Russian, the mother of five-year-old twin boys, Nazar and Timur, describes how she fell to her knees, pulling her sons beneath her to protect them from the pieces of shrapnel. After the bomb's impact she recalls nothing. All three were blinded by the flying fragments that cut into their arms and faces. But the family received urgent treatment in Poland, where a leading surgeon was able to help. Full story here Last month the BBC published drone footage that showed three cars speeding along an empty main road just outside the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, when they suddenly turn around and race back - all except one. This white car turns, but then stops. A man steps out and raises his hands. Then his body falls to the ground. Moments later, Russian soldiers approach. An elderly woman and child leave the car, and a soldier walks them away. The man on the ground was Maksim Iovenko. The 31-year-old was shot dead by Russian forces that were positioned at the roadside. His wife Ksenia, who was in the car, was also killed. The BBC has spoken to Maksim's father about what happened. Full story On 24 February, President Putin shocked Europe out of complacency. His assault on Ukraine has brought large-scale death and destruction back to Europe, including whispers of possible nuclear war. His aim: not only to dominate Ukraine, but to roll back Western dominance militarily and - ideally - politically, in terms of liberal democracy, from the former Soviet sphere of influence.

2,bbc.co.uk,2022-04-04 07:00:00,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60990934,Ukraine war : International outrage grows over civilian killings in Bucha,English,United Kingdom,"Watch: US seeks more sanctions on 'war criminal' Putin US President Joe Biden has called for Russian President Vladimir Putin to be tried for war crimes as evidence emerges of atrocities allegedly committed by Russian forces in Ukraine. There is mounting international anger over the alleged killing of civilians in Bucha, a town near the capital Kyiv. ""This guy is brutal,"" Mr Biden said of the Russian leader, adding that he believes Mr Putin ""is a war criminal"". Without evidence, Russia said images of atrocities had been staged by Ukraine. Mr Biden's intervention follows the publication of new satellite photos by the earth observation company Maxar, which show bodies lining Bucha's streets during its occupation by Russian forces. An analysis of the photos by the New York Times showed at least 11 bodies on the streets since 11 March, when Russian forces controlled the city. Russia claims that no civilians suffered under the Russian occupation of Bucha and says footage and photos from the city were staged. But the timing of these satellite images appears to disprove the idea that the bodies only appeared after Russian soldiers left. US officials say they are supporting a team of international prosecutors heading to Bucha to collect evidence. The Ukrainian government has started a war crimes investigation after it said the bodies of 410 civilians had been found in areas around Kyiv. Some were discovered in mass graves while others had their hands tied and had apparently been shot at close range. Officials in Kyiv also accused Russian forces of killing a village head, her husband and her son in the village of Motoyzhyn for aiding Ukrainian troops in the area. ""You may remember I got criticised for calling Putin a war criminal,"" Mr Biden said. ""You saw what happened in Bucha - he is a war criminal... but we have to gather all the detail so this can have a war crimes trial."" Mr Biden said the Bucha discovery was ""outrageous"" and said that it was important Mr Putin was ""held accountable"" for atrocities committed by his military in Ukraine. He would seek to impose further sanctions on Russia, he added. The US state department said it had credible reports of rape, torture and summary executions carried out by Russian forces as part of what it described as a ""broader, troubling campaign"" by Moscow. At the request of Ukraine, the international prosecutors will support the prosecutor general of Ukraine's war crimes unit. ""There are reports and images of a nightmare litany of atrocities,"" said state department spokesman Ned Price. The Pentagon said it was ""fairly obvious"" that Russia had been behind the atrocities in Bucha, but that more investigation was needed to ascertain which units were responsible. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also accused Russia of war crimes during a televised address on Monday night and suggested Mr Putin's regime would attempt to cover up evidence of other atrocities. ""I'm sure you know about the new old tactics of Russian propagandists who are constantly trying to reject accusations of the Russian military,"" President Zelensky said. ""Now they are doing the same thing. The same lies. They are trying to distort the facts. But, as then, they will not succeed. They will not be able to deceive the whole world."" France and Germany announced on Monday they are expelling Russian diplomats in response to the discoveries in Bucha. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the expulsion of 40 envoys was in response to the ""unbelievable brutality"" the Kremlin had unleashed in Ukraine. The French government said it would expel ""many"" Russian staff, but didn't specify the exact number. Lithuania said it was expelling the Russian ambassador, citing atrocities it says have been committed by Russian troops in Ukraine. Moscow's ambassador to the UN said Russia would present ""empirical evidence"" to the UN Security Council demonstrating that Western statements on events at Bucha were lies. At a press conference in New York, Vasily Nebenzya accused Ukraine and its ""Western sponsors"" of fabricating evidence and carrying out a false flag attack on its own people. In Bucha, witnesses have described Russian soldiers firing on men fleeing after refusing to allow them to leave through humanitarian corridors. At least 20 dead men were found lying in the street, many of them with extensive wounds. Some had been shot through the temple, as if executed, while others had clearly been run over by tanks. Satellite images taken by Maxar show a 14m (45ft) mass grave in the city near the church of St Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints. Have you been affected by what's happening?

Images of mass graves and bodies of civilians reportedly executed in the Kyiv suburb have shocked the world. India's condemnation at the UN meeting is the strongest statement it has made since Russia invaded Ukraine. Delhi has so far abstained from UN votes condemning Russia's actions. In a statement on Tuesday at the UN Security Council meeting, India's permanent representative to the United Nations TS Tirumurti said the country ""remained deeply concerned at the worsening situation and reiterates its call for immediate cessation of violence and end to hostilities"". ""The situation in Ukraine has not shown any significant improvement since the Council last discussed the issue. The security situation has only deteriorated, as well as its humanitarian consequences,"" Mr Tirumurti said. ""We hope the international community will continue to respond positively to the humanitarian needs. We support calls urging for guarantees of safe passage to deliver essential humanitarian and medical supplies."" India has a long history of pursuing a non-aligned foreign policy but is under pressure from Western countries over its diplomatic balancing act. Delhi and Moscow also share a decades-old relationship, and Russia is also India's biggest defence supplier. India recently also placed contracts for nearly six million barrels of Russian crude after prices slumped in the wake of Western sanctions on Russia. But the Indian government says this is ""literally a drop, in a larger bucket"" of its oil imports globally. Last week, Delhi was criticised by the US and Australia for considering a Russian offer that was seen as circumventing the sanctions. The civilian killings in Bucha were uncovered after Russian troops withdrew from the town. The mayor, Anatoli Fedoruk, said on Monday that at least 300 civilians had been killed, but there is no official tally yet. 'Delhi-Moscow ties to be tested' By Vikas Pandey, BBC News, Delhi India's support for an independent inquiry into civilian killings in Bucha is hardly surprising. It stopped short of blaming or naming Russia for the violence in Bucha, which was in line with its policy of neutrality over Ukraine. The West has so far appeared to be accommodating of India's stand, which largely stems from its reliance on Russian defence equipment and its historical ties with Moscow. But as allegations of atrocities in Ukraine mount, so will the pressure on Delhi to take a clearer stand. US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin on Tuesday said that Washington wanted Delhi to scale down its defence dependence on Russia. If his statement is a sign of things to come, India's policy of pushing for diplomacy over Ukraine will be seriously tested.

4,bbc.co.uk,2022-04-07 07:00:00,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61017352,"Russia war : Do Bucha civilian killings amount to genocide ? ",English,United Kingdom,"Atrocities committed by Russian forces in Ukraine have sparked widespread accusations of war crimes - with some voices arguing that Moscow has gone even further. ""That is real genocide, what you have seen here,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said from Bucha, where at least 500 people have been found dead since the Russians left. Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki agrees that the killings in Bucha and other towns near the capital Kyiv ""must be called acts of genocide and be dealt with as such"". UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said attacks on civilians in Bucha do not ""look far short of genocide"". Now US President Joe Biden has accused Russian forces of committing acts of ""genocide"" in Ukraine. He said Russian President Vladimir Putin was trying to ""wipe out the idea"" of a Ukrainian identity. But many countries have stopped short of using the word to describe what's happening in Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron says he is reluctant to use the term and warned against an ""escalation of rhetoric"". So is there a case for accusing Russian forces of committing what has been called the ""crime of all crimes""? Genocide is widely seen as the most serious crime against humanity. It is defined as a mass extermination of a particular group of people - for example, the murder of six million Jews in the Holocaust of World War Two. The UN Genocide Convention defines genocide as committing any of the following ""with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group"": There is no consensus on this. Eugene Finkel, an associate professor of international affairs at Johns Hopkins University, believes genocide is underway in Ukraine. He says there is evidence of killings, carried out in Bucha and other places, of people based on their Ukrainian identity. ""It's not just killing people, it's targeting a national identity group,"" he says. However, it's the rhetoric coming from Moscow that tips over into genocidal intent, Mr Finkel says. He points to an article titled ""What should Russia do with Ukraine?"" published last week by Russia's state-owned media Ria news agency. The article argues that Ukraine ""is impossible as a nation state"" and even its name ""apparently cannot be retained""; the Ukrainian nationalist elite ""need to be liquidated, its re-education is impossible"", argues the article's writer, Timofei Sergeytsev. He bases his theory on the baseless claim that Ukraine is a Nazi state, arguing that a significant section of the population is guilty too because they are ""passive Nazis"", and therefore accomplices. After a Russian victory these people would require re-education lasting at least a generation and it would ""inevitably mean de-Ukrainisation"". ""For me, the shift in tone in recent weeks in Russia, and especially among the elites, was the tipping point that we call the threshold of intent, not just to destroy the state... but to destroy an identity,"" says Prof Finkel. ""The goal of the war is de-Ukrainisation... they are not focusing on the state, they're focusing on Ukrainians."" Gregory Stanton, founding president and chair of Genocide Watch, says there is proof ""that the Russian army is in fact intending to destroy, in part, the Ukrainian national group"". ""That's why they're targeting civilians. They're not just targeting combatants and military."" He says President Putin's claims in the lead-up to the invasion, that the eight-year war in Ukraine's east looked like genocide, were what some scholars call ""mirroring"". ""Often the perpetrator of genocide will accuse the other side - the targeted victims - of intending to commit genocide before, in fact, the perpetrator does so. That's what happened in this case."" But other experts in the field of genocide say it's too early to define Russian atrocities as being in that category. According to Jonathan Leader Maynard, lecturer in international politics at King's College London, says the evidence is still too unclear under the strict wording of the Genocide Convention. That doesn't necessarily mean genocide is not taking place - he says it's ""very clear"" that atrocities are happening - just that the bar has yet to be cleared. ""It's possible that those atrocities could be genocidal or could escalate in future to genocide, but the evidence is not strong enough yet,"" he says. However, he points to the ""deeply troubling"" rhetoric of Russia's president denying Ukraine's historical existence as an independent nation. It illustrates a ""genocidal way of thinking"", he says, where Vladimir Putin believes Ukraine ""isn't real, so they don't have the right to exist"". The risk of genocide is increasing due to that kind of talk, he says, ""but we cannot automatically assume that such rhetoric is going to lead to actions carried out on the ground"". For Philippe Sands, there appears to be evidence of war crimes given the targeting of civilians and the siege of the port city of Mariupol appears to be a crime against humanity. However, Prof Sands, who is director of the Centre for International Courts and Tribunals at University College London, says in order to prove genocide under international law, a prosecutor must establish an intent to destroy a group, in whole or in part. And international courts have set a very high threshold for proving that. Intent can be established by direct evidence where the perpetrators say they are killing people in order to destroy the group. But Prof Sands believes that is unlikely to exist in Ukraine's case. Intent can also be inferred from a pattern of behaviour, ""but that's a tough call"", he adds. Not enough is known yet of the intentions of those Russians alleged to have carried out atrocities. ""Going into a village and executing a significant proportion of adult males from one national or religious group on an apparently systematic basis - if that is what happened in Bucha - could be an indicator of a genocidal intent,"" he says. ""But at this stage we have insufficient evidence to know what precisely happened and why. I think it's right to be extremely alert to signs of genocidal intent, as the war moves to the east of Ukraine and becomes increasingly brutal."" Prof Sands says that the term genocide is often ""being used in a political rather than legal sense"", and that he has ""no objection to President Zelensky and President Biden evoking a possible genocide to garner attention toward the horrors that are being perpetrated"". Alex Hinton, director of the Centre for the Study of Genocide and Human Rights at Rutgers University, says ""a lot has changed in a week"" and that it is ""quite likely"" that Russia is committing genocide in Ukraine. He points to killings and rape as potential evidence. President Putin is displaying genocidal rhetoric, Mr Hinton says, but this will need to be clearly linked to atrocities on the ground to prove genocidal intent. If Ukrainian government reports are confirmed that Ukrainian children are being separated from their parents with a view to having them adopted by Russian families, that would constitute a genocidal act, he says. Whether or not Russia is committing genocide should not cloud what Alex Hinton sees as clear atrocities being committed by Russian forces in Ukraine.

Sarah O'Brien, from Denbighshire, wants to help eight of the Palirua family. They have fled Bucha, where scores of atrocities by Russian soldiers against civilians have been uncovered. The family, which includes grandparents, two of their daughters and four children, escaped to Poland and have been staying in Warsaw. Mrs O'Brien, from Llangollen, said they had approached friends in Ukraine offering to help those fleeing the invasion, when the Homes for Ukraine scheme was launched by the UK government on 14 March. They were then put in touch with the Palirua family. But after three weeks and hours working on applications, only five of the family have received their visa papers to come to Wales. Mrs O'Brien said the Ukraine family have been told they must leave their current accommodation in Warsaw by Sunday, and need urgent help getting permission to come to Britain. ""It was a five-hour process to fill in the eight visas, but it will be three weeks this coming Friday and we are still outstanding three of the visas,"" said Mrs O'Brien. ""In fact, one of the visas has been issued twice, so that's how the system isn't working."" Mrs O'Brien dubbed the situation ""desperate"". The Ukraine family include husband and wife Volodymyr, 75, and Lidiia Paliura, 68, and there two adult daughters, Tetiana and Nataliia. Their daughters have four children with them - Hlib, Andrii, Anastasiia, and Kateryna - who are between six and 15. ""They want to stay together, but if they are moving out of this accommodation (in Warsaw), they are uncertain what other accommodation they will have,"" Mrs O'Brien said. The O'Brien family have offered the refugees a cottage next to their own home, and additional bedrooms in their own house too. ""The situation is so desperate over there. They are from Bucha, their home town has been destroyed,"" said Mrs O'Brien. ""When you see the news, it's just so horrific. ""As soon as we realised we could host them, we wanted to help."" Mrs O'Brien said they were ""pushing hard"" to get the visas issued, and were being supported by the Clwyd South MP Simon Baynes. A UK government spokesman said: ""We acknowledge progress approving visas has not been good enough. ""The Home Office has made changes to visa processing - the application form has been streamlined, Ukrainian passport holders can now apply online and do their biometrics checks once in the UK, and greater resource has gone into the system. ""This is allowing us to welcome people faster, while still maintaining security checks which ensure those who could pose a threat to our safety are prevented from getting here and human trafficking is addressed.""",1,475,62.92,91.38,28.24,31.85,20.65,20.84,80.84,60,48.84,9.05,6.53,0,1.47,0.21,0,4.42,2.53,12.84,6.11,4,11.79,10.32,4,6.32,0.42,18.53,2.74,4.21,6.95,4.21,0.84,1.89,6.32,0,6.32,0.63,1.05,1.89,0.63,0,2.32,0,3.79,2.32,1.47,1.26,0.42,0.84,0.21,0.21,0,0,16.42,6.32,1.26,1.68,0.21,0,2.32,11.79,1.26,0.21,2.32,0.84,1.89,1.26,0.42,0.21,2.95,0,1.68,1.26,0,0,0.42,0.21,0,0.21,0,0,0,0,0,1.05,0.84,1.05,0,0.42,0,0,1.47,0,6.74,9.89,0.21,3.16,6.53,0.21,0,0.42,4.21,6.11,5.05,1.05,0,0,0,0,0,20.21,4.84,7.37,0,0,2.53,5.47

An AFP news agency reporter in Bucha, near Kyiv, counted at least 20 bodies. At least one man had his hands tied. Ukrainian forces regained control of the town this week and photos show widespread devastation. BBC journalists in another part of Ukraine found the bodies of two civilians killed by Russian forces. Warning: Some readers may find content in this story distressing including a photo lower down. Earlier this week the BBC's Jeremy Bowen and his team counted a total of 13 bodies, some of whom may have been Ukrainian soldiers, along a stretch of road between the villages of Mria and Myla. Ukraine says Russian forces have made a ""rapid retreat"" from around Kyiv, with one official saying the whole region around the capital has been retaken since the invasion began on 24 February. The invasion has seen thousands killed in ferocious fighting and has made refugees of at least four million Ukrainians. Western states have responded with tough sanctions against Russia and military supplies for Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin has sought to justify his attack by arguing that Ukraine, a former Soviet state with Nato and EU ambitions, was a constant threat and Russia could not feel ""safe, develop and exist"". In Bucha, where a photographer for Reuters news agency also recorded dead bodies, holes gaped from apartment blocks hit by shelling and crushed cars littered the streets. Sixteen of the 20 bodies seen by AFP lay either on the pavement or by the verge. Three were sprawled in the middle of the road, and another lay on his side in the courtyard of a destroyed house. An open Ukrainian passport lay on the ground next to the person who had his hands tied behind his back with a piece of white cloth. Two other people had white cloth tied around their upper arms. Warning: There is a photo below that some readers may find distressing A Ukrainian official told AFP the dead men could have been killed in a bombardment or shot by Russian soldiers, and police would investigate. But the town's mayor, Anatoly Fedoruk, told AFP by phone that all of the 20 dead had been shot in the back of the head. He added that other bodies still lay inside the wrecks of cars destroyed by shelling. The town, he said, had buried 280 people in mass graves as a result of the Russian invasion.",1,439,97.48,54.99,39.32,1,21.95,21.64,83.37,57.63,45.79,4.78,2.51,0,0,0,1.82,0.23,2.28,17.77,9.79,3.42,16.4,6.15,1.59,4.1,0.23,12.3,6.61,6.15,6.83,0.23,0.46,6.15,8.43,0.23,8.2,1.59,2.51,0.68,1.14,0,2.96,0,4.78,0.46,4.33,1.14,0,1.14,0.46,0.68,0.46,0,10.48,5.01,0.23,0,2.05,0,2.96,5.69,0,0,0,2.51,4.78,1.37,2.73,0.68,2.51,0,0.46,2.05,0,0,4.56,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.82,0,0,0.23,0,0,0,0,0.91,0,3.87,14.58,0.91,1.37,11.16,1.59,0,0.23,2.05,7.29,1.59,0.68,0,0,0,0,0,10.71,4.56,3.87,0,0,0.68,1.59
7,bbc.co.uk,2022-04-03 07:00:00,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60970818,Ukraine war : Bucha street littered with burned - out tanks and corpses,English,United Kingdom,"A suburban avenue in Bucha became one of the first graveyards for Russia's hopes of encircling and entering Kyiv and then deposing the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky. The moment came two or three days after the first Russian forces crossed into Ukraine on 24 February, when Ukrainian forces destroyed a column of Russian tanks and armoured personnel carriers moving through the town of Bucha to the city of Kyiv. The convoy was destroyed in one of the first of many Ukrainian ambushes that stopped the Russian advance dead. Our BBC team was able to get to Bucha because during Friday the final Russian soldiers pulled out, as part of what the Kremlin has presented as a calm and rational decision to concentrate on the war in eastern Ukraine. Moscow says, without proof or any reliability, that its war aims in central Ukraine have been achieved, and they never included capturing Kyiv. The truth is that unexpectedly fierce and well organised Ukrainian resistance stopped them outside the capital, and the evidence includes the rusting and twisted wreckage of the column that still lies where it was destroyed on that suburban street. Two or three weeks into the war the Russian invaders ran out of momentum. On the street in Bucha you can see why. Elite troops from Russia's airborne forces rode into the town in armoured vehicles light enough to be carried by aircraft. They came from Hostomel airport, a few miles away, which had been attacked and seized by Russian paratroopers landed by helicopter on the first day of the invasion. Even then, there was fierce resistance from Ukrainian forces. When the column moved through Bucha on the way to Kyiv, they had a harsh awakening. The road is narrow and straight, an ideal place for an ambush. Witnesses said the Ukrainians attacked the convoy with Bayraktar attack drones bought from Turkey. Other neighbours said Ukrainian territorial defence volunteers were also in the area. However they did it, the lead vehicles and the ones bringing up the rear were knocked out and imprisoned the others. The wreckage has not been touched. Belts of 30mm cannon shells lie on the grass verge, along with many pieces of dangerous and damaged abandoned ordnance. Young conscripts ran away, begging, local people said, not to be turned over to Ukrainian territorial defence. A man of around 70 who called himself uncle Hrysha, said: ""I felt sorry for them. They were so young, 18 to 20, with their whole lives ahead of them."" It looks as if Russians, as they prepared to pull out of Bucha, had no such pity. At least 20 dead men were lying in the street as Ukrainian troops entered the town. Some of them had their hands tied behind their backs. The mayor said they had buried 280 people in mass graves. A few civilians who stayed said they had tried to avoid the Russians. They set up wood fires outside their Khrushchev-era flats, cooking on them outdoors because their gas, power and water were cut. Volunteers are bringing supplies in from Lviv in western Ukraine, and from countries far from the war, geographically at least. ""This is the first bread we've had in 38 days,"" said a woman called Maria, looking at a plastic bag with some modest looking buns inside. Her daughter Larysa showed me round the Soviet-built apartment building. Many of the people who had left for safer areas, or abroad, had bolted shut security doors. The Russians removed them by ripping out the concrete lintels and door posts. A few miles away, the trail of devastation leads to Hostomel airport. Russian airborne troops tried to use it as a base for a push into Kyiv. The world's largest transport plane was destroyed early on. The roof of the enormous hangar built for it was so riddled with a constellation of shrapnel holes. The plane itself, known by the Ukrainian word for dream (Mriya), lies there broken-backed, big chunks of fuselage and engine in places around it. Its fate is a parable of what is happening to Ukraine. An enormous amount of national pride was invested in the aircraft, as a symbol of Ukraine's ability to make big projects all round the world.",1,707,96.15,63.5,57.03,4.64,18.13,22.77,82.46,63.37,49.93,6.93,4.24,0.28,0.28,0.14,0.28,2.83,2.69,15.98,10.04,2.69,17.82,5.37,2.55,5.66,0.57,12.87,7.07,5.37,6.93,1.13,1.27,4.81,5.8,0.42,5.37,0.85,1.56,0.42,0.99,0,1.84,0,3.68,0.85,2.83,0.85,0.42,0.28,0,0.28,0,0,9.76,3.54,0.57,0,0.57,0,1.7,6.22,0.28,0,0.42,0.57,3.25,0.71,2.55,0,1.13,0,0.28,0.57,0.42,0,1.13,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.28,0.57,0.14,0.14,0.28,0,0.14,0,0,0.57,0,2.97,15.28,0.14,2.97,10.89,0.99,0,0.28,2.97,8.77,1.98,0.71,0,0,0,0,0,12.45,5.52,4.81,0,0,0.71,1.41

As the BBC's Anna Foster reports, most people are yet to return, and there's just one small, hardy group who are trying to pave the way for others to come back.

""You forget sometimes that you're still afraid of every sound, even if it comes from your neighbour's house, or if someone bangs a car door... No words can describe how scary it is,"" local resident Anna Budko told the BBC. The Russian defence ministry said it was targeting a military factory in the capital. Explosions were also reported in the western city of Lviv. Officials said air defences destroyed four Russian cruise missiles. Russia has banned UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and other senior ministers from entering Russia over what it described as their ""hostile"" attitude towards the war in Ukraine. The others mentioned in the ban include Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Home Secretary Priti Patel. Moscow said the decision was taken in response to sanctions imposed by the UK since the invasion. ""London's unbridled information and political campaign aimed at isolating Russia internationally, creating conditions for containing our country and strangling the domestic economy"" had prompted its decision, it added. The UK government said it remained resolute in its support for Ukraine. US President Joe Biden has been subject to a similar ban since March.
