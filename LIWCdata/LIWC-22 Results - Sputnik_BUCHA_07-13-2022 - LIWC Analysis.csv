Moscow, for its part, said that the Bucha situation is nothing short of provocation created by Ukraine specifically for the western media. The West is trying to sabotage negotiations between Russia and Ukraine by fueling the hype around the Bucha provocation, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday. The top Russian official noted that the provocation in Bucha took place just as Ukraine rolled out possible peace suggestions, including those regarding Crimea. Should such attempts by the West continue, there is a risk negotiations between Russia and Ukraine will repeat the fate of the Minsk agreements - something that ""should not happen"", the minister said. The talks in Istanbul took place in late March and were considered fruitful, with Russia even noting that Kiev ""confirmed the need to ensure a non-nuclear, non-bloc status of Ukraine"" and its security outside NATO, along with Ukraine acknowledging that the ""issues of Crimea and Donbass have been finally resolved"". ""For us to have real progress, not the illusion of it, we insist that an unambiguous signal be sent to Kiev not to sabotage the process,"" the minister stressed. ""Otherwise, we risk repeating the fate of the Minsk agreements, and we will never agree to this."" The Russian foreign minister went on to say that Moscow is concerned about Kiev's decision to demand the ratification of a potential peace deal and a referendum. According to Lavrov, this might complicate the process. Lavrov's remarks come as the western media, along with the Ukrainian outlets, continue to fuel the narrative that Russia is behind the mass killings of civilians in the Ukrainian city of Bucha, citing footage that shows bodies strewn across the city's streets as evidence. However, the footage appeared to be questionable, as many observers said that ""corpses"" were moving or even standing up when the camera moved past them. Moscow said that the Bucha allegations are ""yet another provocation"" carried out especially for western media and aimed at slandering Russia. Moscow has twice requested an urgent session of the United Nations Security Council over the Bucha situation, but the United Kingdom (which is at present presiding over the UNSC) refused both times to hold the meeting.",1,381,95.64,41.62,36.88,12.07,27.21,29.66,78.22,59.58,48.03,6.56,1.31,0,1.05,0,0,0.26,5.25,16.8,11.29,0.26,16.54,5.51,3.67,4.72,1.31,12.34,3.67,1.31,5.25,1.31,1.05,2.89,8.92,0.52,8.4,1.31,0,1.31,1.57,0.52,2.62,0,2.62,0.79,1.57,0.52,0,0.26,0.26,0,0,0,9.71,5.77,0,0.52,1.05,0.52,3.41,3.15,0,0,0,0.26,4.2,2.36,1.84,0,1.57,0,0,1.57,0,0,1.05,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.79,0.52,0,0.52,0.52,0,0,0.26,1.05,0.26,2.89,9.71,0.26,1.57,7.87,0.26,0,0,4.2,5.51,2.89,1.57,0.26,0,0.26,0,0,14.96,3.67,5.51,0,0,0.79,4.99

The United Nations has ""credible"" evidence on the torture of Russian military personnel by Ukrainian forces, Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine chief Matilda Bogner has said. ""We have received credible information of torture, ill-treatment and incommunicado detention by [the] Ukrainian Armed Forces of prisoners of war belonging to the Russian Armed Forces and affiliated armed groups"", Bogner said in a press briefing on Tuesday. ""We continue to see the publication of videos, which show inhumane treatment, including prisoners from both sides being coerced to make statements, apologies and confessions, and other forms of humiliation. This violates fundamental rules of international humanitarian law"", the official added. Bogner urged both Ukraine and Russia to ""promptly and effectively investigate"" all allegations of the torture and abuse of prisoners of war, and for both sides to ""effectively control and instruct their forces to stop any further violations from occurring"". The UN official also provided an update on the plight of civilians in the conflict zone, saying her agency could corroborate a total of 7,061 civilian casualties, including 3,381 fatalities and 3,680 injuries, since 24 February, adding that the real number was likely higher. ""The high number of civilian casualties and the extent of destruction and damage to civilian objects strongly suggest violations of the principles governing the conduct of hostilities, namely distinction, including the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks, proportionality and precautions"", Bogner said. The official also cited allegations of rape and threats of sexual violence in the conflict area, and the disappearance and forced detention of civilians by both Russian and Ukrainian forces. Russian officials and the Russian military have accused the US and Europe of turning a blind eye to suspected war crimes being committed in Ukraine - not just since the Russia-led operation in Ukraine began in February, but since Kiev kicked off its punitive ""anti-terrorist operation"" in Donbass in the spring of 2014. This includes the alleged kidnapping, detention, torture and execution of hundreds of civilians and militia fighters in Donbass, and the filming of the torture and murder of detained Russian prisoners of war. Kiev, in turn, has accused Moscow of war crimes against civilians, including the cold-blooded murder of over 300 civilians in the Kiev suburb of Bucha in early April. Investigations into these allegations by Russian and independent Western media have cast doubt on these claims, citing the timeline of the withdrawal of Russian forces from the area, the deployment of neo-Nazi national guard formations in the town to punish ""Russian collaborators"",  as well as the white armbands characteristic of Russian military personnel and Russian military issue food rations found among many of the victims, among other evidence. Western officials and media have largely continued to blame Russia for the crime.

India's Permanent Representative at the United Nations (UN) T.S. Tirumurti has hit out at a Dutch diplomat who suggested that New Delhi shouldn’t have abstained from casting its vote in the General Assembly on matters pertaining to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. “Kindly don’t patronise us, Ambassador. We know what to do,” Tirumurti responded to an apparent barb by Karel van Oosterom, the Netherlands’ Ambassador to the United Kingdom. The response came after the Dutch envoy responded to a social media post by Tirumurti, in which the Indian Permanent Representative had shared his statement at the UNSC debate on Ukraine on Thursday. “You should not have abstained in the GA. Respect the UN Charter,” van Oosterom had remarked. New Delhi has regularly abstained from voting on draft resolutions and procedural votes at the UN General Assembly and the Security Council since Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the special military operation to ""demilitarise and de-Nazify"" Ukraine on 24 February. India’s stance at the UN has been in line with its neutral stance that it has taken on the Ukraine issue, much to the chagrin of its American and European partners, who have consistently tried to draw New Delhi into the anti-Russia, Western camp. On 7 April, New Delhi abstained from voting on a resolution calling to suspend Russia from the UN Human Right Council (UNHRC) in the wake of surfacing of footage of dead bodies in Bucha, a suburb of Kiev. While Western countries have blamed Russia for the “massacre”, President Putin has said that the incident was “staged” by Kiev authorities. The resolution was eventually passed at the UNGA, leading to Moscow’s ouster from the UNHRC. New Delhi, for its part, “condemned” the incident and called for an “independent” probe into the killings. Then, on 2 March, New Delhi abstained from a draft resolution which “deplored in the strongest terms the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine in violation of Article 2 (4) of the Charter”. On 24 March, India abstained from another resolution which blamed Moscow for the “dire” humanitarian situation in Ukraine. While New Delhi has refused to pick sides in the conflict in Ukraine, the South Asian nation has consistently called for “cessation of hostilities” and the need for a direct dialogue between Presidents Putin and Vladimir Zelensky. ‘India Remains on the Side of Peace’, Envoy Tells UNSC At the UNSC debate on Ukraine on Thursday, Ambassador Tirumurti reiterated New Delhi’s stance about the need to put an “immediate end” to the hostilities in Ukraine and return to the “path of diplomacy”. #IndiainUNSC📺Watch: Permanent Representative @AmbTSTirumurti speak at the #UNSC Briefing on the situation in #Ukraine ⤵️@MEAIndia @IndiainUkraine @IndEmbMoscow pic.twitter.com/KZ6lj3MPdu— India at UN, NY (@IndiaUNNewYork) May 5, 2022 “India remains on the side of peace and therefore believes that there will be no winning side in this conflict and while those impacted by this conflict will continue to suffer, diplomacy will be a lasting casualty,” the Indian diplomat said in his statement. Tirumurti also spelled out New Delhi’s concerns about the “destabilising” effects of the Ukraine conflict on global oil prices as well as a “shortage” of grain and fertiliser. “This has had a disproportionate impact on the Global South and developing countries,” he stated. “Let me conclude by reaffirming that the contemporary global order has been built on the UN Charter, international law and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of states,” Tirumurti concluded.",1,605,98.34,47.91,23.92,16.47,27.5,30.74,74.21,54.88,43.97,5.12,1.82,0.17,0.33,0.17,0.83,0,3.31,13.88,10.41,1.49,18.18,4.96,1.82,4.3,0.66,9.09,5.45,0.83,3.97,0.83,0.5,2.81,5.29,0.17,5.12,0.99,1.16,0.66,0.17,0.17,1.32,0,5.95,2.81,3.14,0.66,0,0.66,0,0.5,0,0,10.91,7.6,1.65,0,1.82,0.83,2.98,2.98,0,0,0,0.99,7.11,4.96,1.82,0.33,1.32,0,0,1.16,0.17,0,0.99,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.66,0.66,0,0.17,0.17,0,0,0.17,0.33,0,1.98,8.26,0.17,0.99,7.11,0.33,0,0,5.12,3.47,2.15,0.83,0.17,0.17,0,0,0,19.5,4.13,4.63,0,0,1.49,9.26

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed that a missile strike had caused the blaze. On Monday, the Russian Aerospace Forces destroyed the weapons and ammunition that Ukrainian troops had received from the United States and European countries with a high-precision weapon strike. The detonation of ammunition for Western weapons stored in the vicinity of an automobile plant in Kremenchug, a city in Ukraine caused a fire in a non-operational shopping center located nearby, the Russian Defense Ministry said. ""On June 27, in the city of Kremenchug, Poltava region, the Russian Aerospace Forces struck hangars with weapons and ammunition received from the United States and European countries with high-precision air-based weapons, in the area of the Kremenchug road machinery plant. As a result of a high-precision strike, Western-made weapons and ammunition concentrated in the warehouse area for further dispatch to the Ukrainian group of troops in the Donbass were hit,"" the Russian Defense Ministry said. On Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote in his telegram channel that a shopping center was burning in Kremenchug. He claimed that it had been struck by a missile, and blamed Russia for it. In turn, the first deputy permanent representative of Russia to the UN Dmitry Polyansky said that it could be a new Bucha-style Ukrainian provocation and that there were many striking inconsistencies in the situation with the shopping center fire. He added that this was exactly what the Kiev regime needed to keep its focus on Ukraine ahead of the NATO summit. In early April, Ukraine and the West have accused Russia of alleged atrocities in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, which Moscow has consistently denied. Russia launched a special military operation in Ukraine on February 24 in response to calls by the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics for protection from Ukrainian troops. The Russian Defense Ministry said the goal of the operation, which targets Ukrainian military infrastructure, is to ""demilitarize and denazify"" Ukraine, and to completely liberate Donbas.Russian President Vladimir Putin has said the operation aims to ""protect people subjected to genocide by the Kiev regime for eight years."" As of March 25, the Russian Armed Forces completed the main tasks of the first stage, significantly reducing the combat potential of Ukraine.

""We consider very real the threat of chemical terrorism by fascist nationalists, operating under the patronage of the current Kiev regime, and units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine under their control,"" Syromolotov said. ""The high probability of such a scenario implementation is conditioned by multiple chemical provocations organized by armed extremist groups controlled by the United States and its NATO allies during the Syrian conflict,"" he said. Syromolotov said an example of this was the staged provocation in the Ukrainian town of Bucha and the plans for chemical provocations in Donbas hatched by the team of Volodymyr Zelensky, about which Russia has repeatedly informed the UN Security Council and the OPCW. “We will not be surprised if similar accusations are made against us in relation to the recent events at the Zarya plant (the town of Rubezhnoye), where militants undertook to blow up tanks with nitric acid so that the resulting cloud of toxic substances was carried by the wind to the settlement of Kudryashovka, liberated from them,"" he said. ""We do not rule out that such terrorist attacks will be repeated, since, according to some estimates, about 40,000 tonnes of highly toxic substances remain at this enterprise, including nitric, sulfuric and hydrochloric acids, as well as ammonia,"" Syromolotov said. Moreover, the deputy foreign minister added that Moscow also does not rule out a scenario in which nuclear material could be brought to Ukraine from third countries. Russian Embassy Urges US to Destroy Its Own Chemical Weapons In the meantime, the Russian Embassy in the US responded to State Department spokesman Ned Price's claims on Tuesday that Russia could use chemical weapons in Ukraine, calling on Washington not to spread disinformation and to intensify the process of destroying its chemical weapons. ""We call on Washington to stop spreading disinformation,"" the embassy wrote in its Telegram channel. ""Instead, colleagues should have intensified the process of chemical demilitarization of their country. The United States remains the only state party to the Chemical Weapons Convention that has not fulfilled the international commitments it made. The American arsenal of weapons of this type poses a real threat to humanity."" The embassy stressed that Price's allegations are not supported by any evidence at all. ""Ned Price once again distinguished himself by his idle talk, not substantiated by a single piece of evidence,"" the response reads. Furthermore, the diplomatic mission noted that the Russian army does not have chemical warfare agents, and all stockpiles of chemical weapons have been destroyed years ago. ""The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation are successfully carrying out all their tasks on the Ukrainian territory. At the same time, they do not and cannot have any chemical warfare agents at their disposal because our country eliminated all chemical weapons stockpiles back in 2017,"" the embassy said. They added that the data about the preparation of provocations by Ukrainian radicals using chemicals confirmed by the Russian Ministry of Defense caused great concerns. ""We also have questions about the origin of these substances,"" the embassy said. Russia launched a military operation in Ukraine on February 24 to ""protect of people who have been subjected to abuse and genocide by the Kiev regime for eight years."" According to the Russian Ministry of Defense's latest statements, the forces strike only at the military infrastructure and Ukrainian troops and, as of March 25, they have completed the main tasks of the first stage - significantly reducing the combat potential of Ukraine.

Does this mean the alliance is determined to fuel the conflict to the last Ukrainian? ""Everything about NATO is hypocritical,"" says Bruce Gagnon, coordinator of the Global Network Against Weapons and Nuclear Power in Space. ""They declare they are a 'peace alliance' yet their history is nothing but war. Yugoslavia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria and now Ukraine all reveal that NATO is in fact the pirate forces of corporate globalisation. NATO's job is to force submission to western corporate demands."" NATO's Foreign Ministers meeting in Brussels this week will be focused on the Russian special operation launched on 24 February to demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine. According to the alliance's official website, the summit will be joined by foreign ministers from Ukraine, Finland, Sweden, Georgia, and the European Union, and by NATO’s Asia-Pacific partners - Australia, Japan, New Zealand and the Republic of Korea. Speaking to journalists on Tuesday, the secretary-general stated: ""Allies are determined to provide further support to Ukraine, including anti-tank weapons, air-defence systems and other equipment."" Stoltenberg also mentioned Kiev's Bucha provocation: ""We have all seen the horrific images of murdered civilians in Bucha and other places, controlled by the Russian military until a few days ago,"" he said, adding that ""all the facts must be established."" Previously, the Russian Defence Ministry debunked Kiev and mainstream media's ""Bucha massacre"" narrative showing that the incident was nothing but a gruesome false flag operation by the Ukrainian military and nationalists. According to international observers, the Bucha provocation could be aimed at increasing weaponry supplies to Ukraine, torpedo the ongoing negotiations between Moscow and Kiev and prolong the conflict. Immediately after the incident, Poland's President Andrzej Duda called for more weapons to be sent to Ukraine. For her part, British Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss, tweeted on 4 April: ""We need to be tougher on Russia to ensure [Vladimir] Putin loses in Ukraine which means more weapons and more sanctions."" The calls for increasing arms supplies are being made under the guise of ""protecting democracy"" in Ukraine. ""True democracy and expanding conflict do not match,"" says Gagnon. ""They are opposites. This war in Ukraine would never have happened had US-NATO been willing to negotiate seriously with Russia's fair and sensible demands to stop NATO expansion, end the war games on Russia's doorstep, close down the new US missile launch bases in Romania and Poland [a Cuban missile crisis in reverse] and put in writing real security guarantees for Russia. But NATO was not interested in true security for anyone - except the US-NATO weapons industry that stands to make big profits from this war."" In mid-December 2021, Russia handed over draft security agreements which requested legal guarantees of NATO's non-expansion eastward and non-admission of Ukraine to the transatlantic alliance, among other matters. However, the US, the EU and NATO rejected core security provisions of the Russian drafts. What NATO does want is a protracted war, according to Gagnon: ""NATO intends to create a 'festering sore' in Ukraine right along Russia's border,"" he says. ""I'd not be at all surprised to see Poland sent into the war as well to help ensure this war widens."" The transatlantic alliance has a clear motive for bolstering bellicose sentiment within its ranks, according to the expert. NATO and its powerful defence contractors are benefiting from continued arms shipments to Ukraine, he notes. At the same time, ""the agenda of demonising Moscow and stoking up instability along Russia's borders is clearly a key NATO goal,"" Gagnon stresses. ""These are all signs of a desperate western corporate system that is steadily losing economic and military domination of the planet,"" the expert says. ""These corporate interests have made the determination that they must try to disrupt and take down Russia and China's flourishing agenda to create a multi-polar world that is outside the current Wall Street and Bank of England control."" Gagnon believes that the Russo-Ukrainian conflict is, in reality, a conflict between Russia and NATO, with the latter brazenly using Ukraine ""as a tool to take the heat and suffer the damage and losses."" ""This cynical ploy by the 'western alliance' reveals its deep hatred of true democracy and despite its howling concern about lost Ukrainian lives, in fact US-NATO does not for a minute care about any of the lives being lost on either side of this sad conflict,"" Gagnon says. ""The US-NATO only wants power and control and is willing to burn any nation to the ground that stands in its way. We've witnessed this NATO 'modus operandi' repeatedly put into operation in recent years.""",1,790,93.25,43.79,17.22,4.97,24.69,31.65,78.48,55.95,42.91,5.44,1.77,0.13,0.51,0,0.51,0.63,3.67,13.04,7.85,0.63,14.94,5.95,1.9,5.44,0.89,12.15,6.71,2.53,7.34,1.9,1.27,4.43,9.24,1.14,8.1,1.14,1.39,1.39,0.51,0.89,2.53,0,5.95,1.9,3.8,1.27,0,1.01,0.25,0.25,0.13,0,7.97,5.32,1.52,0.13,1.01,0.13,2.28,3.67,0,0,0.13,0.38,6.2,4.94,1.01,0.25,2.91,0.13,0,2.53,0.38,0.13,1.01,0.13,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.25,0.51,0.25,0.38,0,0,0.13,0.38,1.01,0.63,2.28,9.24,0.76,0.51,6.84,0.76,0.13,0.25,3.67,3.04,4.56,0.51,0.13,0.13,0,0,0,20.76,3.92,5.95,0.13,0,3.04,7.72

The upcoming NATO summit in Madrid may include an announcement of plans to double the size of the battlegroups stationed in Eastern Europe, with the possibility that these forces be turned into full-fledged brigades, El Pais has reported, citing sources said to be familiar with discussions on the matter. According to the newspaper, the potential changes would at least double the 1,000-1,600 troop-strong battlegroups presently deployed to brigade-sized groupings, which typically have between 3,000 and 5,000 soldiers. The possibility of even larger forces, including entire NATO divisions, consisting of up to 15,000 troops and commanded by alliance generals, is also expected to be discussed. El Pais suggested that the summit will mark a “turning point” in NATO’s post-Cold War history, with the bloc expected to experience “a kind of refoundation” via the “Madrid concept,” a new strategic model which the newspaper’s sources said would “put an end” to the bloc’s “ties with Moscow.” NATO first deployed so-called “enhanced forward presence” battlegroups to Poland and the Baltic states in 2017, in the aftermath of the 2014 US-backed coup in Kiev which overthrew the country’s government and culminated in the current crisis with Moscow. Four additional battlegroups are being formed in Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia, bringing the total number to eight. Separately on Sunday, Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares clarified that while NATO was actively discussing expanding the alliance to the Nordic states of Sweden and Finland, Kiev is not under consideration, and its status “has never been on the negotiating table.” On Saturday, Ihor Zhovkva, the deputy chief of the Ukrainian president’s office, told the Financial Times that Ukraine is no longer seeking to join the Western alliance, since its members have rejected Kiev’s aspirations. Instead, he said, Ukraine will be looking to work with the bloc on its “partnership,” and pressure it into recognizing Ukraine’s role as a “cornerstone of European security.” “We expect in the NATO strategic concept…that there will be more strict and severe warnings to the Russian aggression. Don’t be shy, that’s my appeal to NATO members, in formulating the provisions vis-à-vis Russia,” Zhovkva urged. NATO’s current strategic concept – which highlights the alliance’s mission and security goals, was last updated in 2010, at the height of the Western bloc’s occupation of Afghanistan and the US-led ‘war on terror’. The Western military alliance first recognized Ukraine’s “NATO aspirations” at its Bucharest summit in 2008, ignoring Russian security concerns related to the bloc’s gradual expansion toward Russia’s borders. The step was approved by US President George W. Bush, despite opposition from European leaders, including Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and French President Nicolas Sarkozy. Bush’s own defense secretary, Robert Gates, told Bush that offering Ukraine the prospect of NATO membership would be “truly overreaching” and “recklessly ignoring what the Russians considered their own vital national interests.” Kiev’s aspirations to join NATO and the European Union were enshrined into the country’s constitution in February 2019. NATO has expanded eastward in three major waves, incorporating the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland in 1999, Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and the Baltic states in 2004, and Albania, Croatia, Montenegro and North Macedonia between 2009 and 2020. The bloc pressed forward with the expansion despite promises by George H.W. Bush-era secretary of state James Baker not to expand the alliance “one inch to the east” of a reunified Germany. Even Boris Yeltsin, the alcohol-swilling 1990s Russian president who yucked it up with President Clinton and asked God to bless America, characterized the prospect of NATO expansion toward Russia as a “threat.” As far back as 1994, after Clinton reversed course on his predecessor’s NATO policy, Yeltsin asked alliance members “why” they were “sowing the seeds of mistrust” and threatening to plunge Europe into a “cold peace.”",1,677,97.2,56.81,26.28,9.01,29.43,33.38,76.96,50.66,40.92,4.28,1.18,0.15,0.3,0,0.3,0.3,3.1,13.44,9.45,3.55,15.36,5.17,1.48,4.43,0.74,9.01,5.61,2.81,9.31,2.95,1.48,4.87,7.53,0.3,6.94,1.62,1.33,0.89,0.74,0.3,1.62,0,4.43,1.62,2.81,0.44,0,0.44,0.15,0.15,0,0,10.04,6.2,1.33,0,1.48,0,2.36,5.02,0,0,0,0.3,6.65,5.17,1.48,0,2.22,0,0,1.77,0.15,0.3,0.44,0.3,0,0,0,0.15,0,0.3,0,0.3,0.44,0,0,0,0,0.15,1.18,0.15,1.03,9.9,0.74,1.18,7.83,0.15,0,0.15,3.4,3.84,1.77,2.07,0,0,0,0,0,22.45,3.69,7.83,0,0,2.95,7.98

Russian and US officials are set to hold talks on strategic stability on Monday, followed by a meeting of the NATO-Russia Council on Wednesday. Russia is not prepared to discuss with the US and NATO any demands for 'deescalation measures' on its own territory in the course of the upcoming security talks, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov has said. ""I can say that that...the demands of the United States and other NATO countries that we carry out some 'de-escalation measures' on our territory are out of the question. This is a non-starter in the literal sense of the word. If the Americans want to talk about changing our approach, for example, to the Minsk Package of Measures [on peace in Ukraine] or even stutter about something like Crimea, this also has no chance for discussions,"" Ryabkov said in an interview with Russian media on Sunday. Russia has not been thrown off balance by the ""tough"" position set by the US and its NATO allies ahead of this week's security talks, Ryabkov added. ""The US position is quite tough; by all indications it has interlocked completely with the position which our neighbours in the West, and the one our direct neighbours from the so-called Bucharest Nine group of countries have been working out over the past weeks,""  Ryabkov said, referring to the group of nine Eastern European and Baltic country members of NATO ringing Russia's western frontiers. ""And of course, the NATO Secretariat is adding fire -sometimes burning with fire on this subject. But we have seen worse and this does not throw us off balance. We will explain persistently our logic and present arguments in support of our position,"" the diplomat added. Ryabkov noted that Russia is prepared to conduct an article-by-article discussion on the two security treaty proposals published by the Foreign Ministry in December. ""Whether or not our American colleagues will be inclined for such a conversation, I have my doubts, based on the signals which we have heard over the past few days,"" he said. The senior diplomat, who arrived in Geneva Sunday for the upcoming Russia-US, Russia-NATO and Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe talks this week, also emphasized that any agreements reached between the two sides must be legally binding, and stressed that there would be no problems on the ratification of any treaties from the Russian side. Although many of the proposed security treaties' articles would be mutually observable, it would be up to the West to unilaterally reject further eastward expansion of NATO, and eliminate the existing military infrastructure it has established in the post-Soviet space, Ryabkov said. ""Even a layman understands that demanding concessions from Russia in a situation where NATO has been striving throughout the past decades to 'drive back' our country and turn it - if not into a subordinate, then at least to a secondary role in European and international politics - and to do so with direct damage to our security, will no longer work. This is all in the past,"" he said. ""NATO needs to collect up its belongings and go back to the borders of 1997,"" Ryabkov added, referring to the alliance's frontiers as they stood before the bloc began to incorporate countries in Eastern Europe. The diplomat stressed that the Russian side is not ""naive"" enough to believe that a clarification of the position of the two sides will lead to immediate progress on the security proposals. Instead, he said, he would like ""to get a clearer idea of what kind of leeway in positions our colleagues in Washington have. That's why we have come to Geneva. Leeway on the issues of interest to us, in the first place,"" he said. ""For us, a positive result would be a non-rejection of the set of priorities which we have formulated - and readiness to continue working on them,"" Ryabkov explained. Twin Treaties The Russian Foreign Ministry published two draft proposals on security guarantees between Russia, the US and NATO in mid-December. The proposed agreement between Russia and the US calls on both countries not to deploy forces and missiles in areas where they might be perceived as a threat to one another's national security, limits on the deployment of intermediate and shorter-range missiles, and a halt to NATO's eastward expansion. The second treaty, between Russia and NATO, similarly proposes a halt in the Western bloc's expansion, including the explicit request that Ukraine not be allowed to join the alliance. It also sets limits on the deployment of weapons and troops by NATO members to the alliance's eastern frontiers, except in exceptional circumstances and with Russia's agreement. The agreement calls for an explicit affirmation by both sides that they do not consider one another as adversaries. Russian officials have stressed that the agreements should be ""evaluated in their totality"" and not seen as a ""menu, where it is possible to pick and choose"" individual components one side happens to like. No Breakthroughs Expected Speaking to US media on the Sunday morning news circuit, Secretary of State Antony Blinken told CNN and ABC News that he does not expect ""any breakthroughs"" at the upcoming talks, with the negotiations instead providing an opportunity to discuss Russia's apprehensions about NATO, ""as well as address many concerns about Russia's conduct in Europe."" Blinken suggested that the scale of NATO drills could be up for discussion, but that troop numbers are not. He also suggested that ""there may be grounds for renewing"" the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which Washington unilaterally scrapped in 2019 under Donald Trump.",1,954,93.23,55.05,35.26,20.23,29.81,30.08,82.81,63.73,52.73,8.18,3.88,0.31,2.2,0,0.73,0.52,4.3,16.88,9.33,1.36,17.71,6.29,2.31,5.45,1.68,12.16,4.4,3.98,6.6,3.77,1.05,1.89,11.01,0.73,10.06,1.47,0.84,1.47,1.78,0.84,3.46,0,2.31,1.15,1.15,0.73,0.21,0.52,0.42,0.1,0,0,11.84,6.08,0.63,0.1,0.52,0,3.77,5.77,0,0,0,0.73,6.18,5.03,1.05,0.1,2.2,0,0.21,1.99,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1,0.21,0.21,0,0.1,0,0.1,1.26,0,3.25,10.69,0.1,1.26,8.91,0.21,0.21,0.21,2.83,3.14,3.14,2.41,0,0,0,0,0,15.72,3.67,4.82,0,0,1.89,5.35

Amid a scramble by the Joe Biden administration and NATO allies to shore up the Kiev regime’s defences by vowing to send more military assistance to Ukraine, such aid only worsens the conflict, warned Moscow's ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Antonov, and could potentially lead to a direct conflict between the US and Russia. ""Western states are directly involved in the current events as they continue to pump Ukraine with weapons and ammunitions, thereby inciting further bloodshed"", Antonov stated in an interview for Newsweek. The actions of the West in Ukraine are dangerous and could lead to ""military confrontation"" between the US and Russia, said the envoy. ""We warn that such actions are dangerous and provocative as they are directed against our state. They can lead the US and the Russian Federation onto the path of direct military confrontation. Any supply of weapons and military equipment from the West, performed by transport convoys through the territory of Ukraine, is a legitimate military target for our Armed Forces"", said Antonov. Kiev's ethnic cleansing, along with its bid to join the US-led NATO military alliance, was among the driving factors that prompted Russia to start its special operation to demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine, said Moscow's envoy to Washington. ""The special operation in Ukraine is the result of the unwillingness of the Kiev regime to stop the genocide of Russians by fulfilling its obligations under the international commitments. The desire of the NATO member states to use the territory of a neighboring state to establish a foothold in the struggle against Russia is also obvious"", stated Antonov. Russia's President Vladimir Putin authorised the start of the special military operation in Ukraine on 24 February after the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics (DPR and LPR) appealed for assistance amid ceaseless attacks by Kiev forces throughout an eight-year offensive targeting the predominantly Russian-speaking Donbass. Ever since, the Russian Defence Ministry has underscored that Moscow has no plans to occupy the country, with the operation exclusively targeting Ukrainian military infrastructure. Weighing in on the ongoing operation, the envoy stated: ""Its aim is to demilitarize and denazify Ukraine in order to reduce military threats posed by the Western states that are trying to use the fraternal Ukrainian people in the struggle against the Russians"". Antonov emphasised that the events that began on 24 February have roots dating back eight years, when the Euromaidan uprising of 2014 – a ""bloody coup d'état instigated by the West"" – toppled the lawfully-elected Ukrainian government and ""ultranationalist ideas came to power in Kiev"". After that, hostile policies such as the removal of Russian as a national language and the rehabilitation of nationalist Ukrainian figures such as Stepan Bandera, who collaborated with Nazi Germany during World War II, took ""root in Ukraine under external administration"". Fledgling independence movements created by local residents refused to accept the authority of the new political leaders, proclaiming the breakaway Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics in the eastern region of Donbass, with Kiev sending the military in to crush the resistance in the spring of 2014. In February 2015, the leaders of Ukraine and three nations acting as guarantors – Russia, Germany, and France – met in Minsk, Belarus to sign the Minsk peace deal, calling for an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the front line, plus local elections in the Donbass and constitutional reform in Kiev granting the self-proclaimed republics broad autonomy. However, according to Antonov, the ""nationalist frenzy and revanchist sentiments of the Kiev regime"" resulted in the effective death of the Minsk deals. As a result, Ukraine opted to follow ""the path of rapid militarization"" with help funnelled from abroad. While violating the ceasefire, the Ukrainian government also refused to honour the political portion of the Minsk Agreements, turning the conflict into a frozen civil war. ""The NATO member countries have commenced a military exploration of Ukraine… It was flooded with Western weaponry while President Volodymyr Zelensky announced Kiev's plans to acquire nuclear weapons which would threaten not only neighboring countries, but also the entire world"", the Russian diplomat stated. Antonov argued in the interview that ahead of Russia’s special operation, Ukraine had amassed its forces in preparation for an attack on the breakaway states in Donbass. ""In this context, Russia had no other choice but to recognize the independence of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics. Then, in accordance with Chapter VII, Article 51 of the UN Charter, with the authorization of the Federation Council of Russia and in execution of the Treaties of Friendship and Mutual Assistance with the Donetsk People's Republic and the Lugansk People's Republic, President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin made a decision to begin a special military operation"". Russia's envoy to the US emphasised that the goal of the operation ""is to put an end to the genocide perpetrated by the Kiev regime and ensure a nuclear-free and neutral status of Ukraine"". Antonov dismissed the latest Ukrainian allegations that Russian forces were responsible for targeting civilians in Bucha, underscoring that the Russian Federation is ""taking the necessary measures to preserve life and safety of civilians"". The Kiev authorities and Western media have been spreading video footage, purportedly from the Ukrainian town of Bucha near Kiev, with the bodies of allegedly dead people lying along a road, claiming that they are murdered civilians. The Russian Defence Ministry said that all photos and videos allegedly proving crimes by Russian troops in Bucha are yet another provocation. Furthermore, the authenticity of the claims has even been questioned by social media users, who noted that some of the ""corpses"" appear to move or even stand up when they are no longer in front of the camera. Russian units provided nothing but support to the locals and delivered over 450 tonnes of humanitarian aid, before withdrawing from Bucha on 30 March as part of de-escalation steps voluntarily undertaken by Moscow to facilitate peace negotiations with Ukraine. Moscow has categorically insisted that the footage from Bucha is staged specifically to be promoted in the Western media to slander Russia and sabotage peace talks between Moscow and Kiev. Antonov also weighed in on reports of the Pentagon engaging in potentially illicit biological research activities in Ukraine. Russian forces discovered US-operated biolabs in the country carrying out dangerous pathogen research. While Washington initially tried to deny their existence, they later confirmed it, while claiming the labs’ activities were unremarkable. ""What does the Pentagon have to do with health issues? Why are biolaboratories established along Russian borders—thousands of kilometers away from the American territory?"" queried the envoy. Antonov accused the West of ""demonizing” Russia, whose policy is “based on the right for all the peoples living today in the Ukrainian territory to choose their own future"". Regarding the numerous rounds of talks that have taken place between Moscow and Kiev, Antonov stated that Russia’s principled position regarding the settlement of the conflict includes the demand for an “unconditional consideration of Russia's security interests, the demilitarization and denazification of the Ukrainian state, ensuring its neutral and non-nuclear status as well as the recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea and the independence of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics"".",1,1214,99,51.85,24.58,9.22,31.13,36.16,77.59,52.88,44.15,3.62,1.15,0,0.25,0,0,0.66,2.47,15.57,11.7,1.07,17.87,3.38,1.65,5.77,0.41,6.92,4.7,1.73,8.24,1.32,1.15,6.01,6.18,0.58,5.6,1.32,1.73,0.58,0.66,0.16,1.4,0,4.12,1.4,2.55,0.58,0,0.41,0,0.41,0,0.08,9.06,5.35,0.99,0.25,1.57,0.49,1.81,3.62,0.08,0.08,0,0,8.57,5.85,2.47,0.25,2.8,0,0.25,2.55,0,0,1.07,0.33,0.08,0,0,0,0,0,0.58,0.25,0.08,0.58,0,0.08,0,0.08,0.74,0.49,2.39,9.56,0.41,0.99,7.99,0.08,0,0.08,3.21,2.72,2.31,0.74,0,0,0,0,0,13.67,3.13,4.53,0.16,0,1.57,4.28
